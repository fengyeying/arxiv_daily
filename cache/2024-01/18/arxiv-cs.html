<p class="mathjax">This research presents a new parametric style transfer framework specifically
designed for curve-based design sketches. In this research, traditional
challenges faced by neural style transfer methods in handling binary sketch
transformations are effectively addressed through the utilization of parametric
shape-editing rules, efficient curve-to-pixel conversion techniques, and the
fine-tuning of VGG19 on ImageNet-Sketch, enhancing its role as a feature
pyramid network for precise style extraction. By harmonizing intuitive
curve-based imagery with rule-based editing, this study holds the potential to
significantly enhance design articulation and elevate the practice of style
transfer within the realm of product design.

<p class="mathjax">There exists a correlation between geospatial activity temporal patterns and
type of land use. A novel self-supervised approach is proposed to stratify
landscape based on mobility activity time series. First, the time series signal
is transformed to the frequency domain and then compressed into task-agnostic
temporal embeddings by a contractive autoencoder, which preserves cyclic
temporal patterns observed in time series. The pixel-wise embeddings are
converted to image-like channels that can be used for task-based, multimodal
modeling of downstream geospatial tasks using deep semantic segmentation.
Experiments show that temporal embeddings are semantically meaningful
representations of time series data and are effective across different tasks
such as classifying residential area and commercial areas. Temporal embeddings
transform sequential, spatiotemporal motion trajectory data into semantically
meaningful image-like tensor representations that can be combined (multimodal
fusion) with other data modalities that are or can be transformed into
image-like tensor representations (for e.g., RBG imagery, graph embeddings of
road networks, passively collected imagery like SAR, etc.) to facilitate
multimodal learning in geospatial computer vision. Multimodal computer vision
is critical for training machine learning models for geospatial feature
detection to keep a geospatial mapping service up-to-date in real-time and can
significantly improve user experience and above all, user safety.

<p class="mathjax">As the more sensors and actuators are used in the robotic systems to provide
more features, complexity of the system is increasing. When it comes to medical
robotics, it becomes harder to ensure safety and determinism in the system. To
deal with increasing complexity and ensure precise periodicity and execution
timing for a medical robot, in this paper we report development of EtherCAT
master as a part of software framework for spine surgery robot. We implemented
multi-axis controller using open-source EtherCAT master running in real-time
preemptive Linux. We evaluated the real-time performance of the system in terms
of periodicity, jitter and execution time in our first prototype of spine

<p class="mathjax">Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is essential for modeling complex
large-deformation problems across various applications, requiring significant
computational power. A major portion of SPH computation time is dedicated to
the Nearest Neighboring Particle Search (NNPS) process. While advanced NNPS
algorithms have been developed to enhance SPH efficiency, the potential
efficiency gains from modern computation hardware remain underexplored. This
study investigates the impact of GPU parallel architecture, low-precision
computing on GPUs, and GPU memory management on NNPS efficiency. Our approach
employs a GPU-accelerated mixed-precision SPH framework, utilizing
low-precision float-point 16 (FP16) for NNPS while maintaining high precision
for other components. To ensure FP16 accuracy in NNPS, we introduce a Relative
Coordinated-based Link List (RCLL) algorithm, storing FP16 relative coordinates
of particles within background cells. Our testing results show three
significant speedup rounds for CPU-based NNPS algorithms. The first comes from
parallel GPU computations, with up to a 1000x efficiency gain. The second is
achieved through low-precision GPU computing, where the proposed FP16-based
RCLL algorithm offers a 1.5x efficiency improvement over the FP64-based
approach on GPUs. By optimizing GPU memory bandwidth utilization, the
efficiency of the FP16 RCLL algorithm can be further boosted by 2.7x, as
demonstrated in an example with 1 million particles. Our code is released at
https://github.com/pnnl/lpNNPS4SPH.

posing a safety risk to drivers. The introduction of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) is widely used in the industry for object detection based on
Deep Learning methods and has achieved significant progress in hardware
improvement and software implementations. In this paper, a unique better
algorithm is proposed to warrant the use of low-resolution cameras or
low-resolution images and video feed for automatic pothole detection using
Super Resolution (SR) through Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks
(SRGANs). Then we have proceeded to establish a baseline pothole detection
performance on low quality and high quality dashcam images using a You Only
Look Once (YOLO) network, namely the YOLOv7 network. We then have illustrated
and examined the speed and accuracy gained above the benchmark after having
upscaling implementation on the low quality images.

<p class="mathjax">A method to efficiently and quantitatively study the delivery of a
pesticide-surfactant formulation in water solution over plants leaves is
presented. Instead of measuring the contact angle, the surface of the leaves
wet area is used as key parameter. To this goal, a deep learning model has been
trained and tested, to automatically measure the surface of area wet with water
solution over cucumber leaves, processing the frames of video footage. We have
individuated an existing deep learning model, reported in literature for other
applications, and we have applied it to this different task. We present the
measurement technique, some details of the deep learning model, its training
procedure and its image segmentation performance. Finally, we report the
results of the wet areas surface measurement as a function of the concentration
of a surfactant in the pesticide solution.

<p class="mathjax">Adequate consideration is crucial to ensure that services in a distributed
application context are running satisfactorily with the resources available.
Due to the asynchronous nature of tasks and the need to work with multiple
layers that deliver coordinated results in a single-threaded context, analysing
performance is a challenging task in event-loop-based systems.
<br />The existing performance analysis methods for environments such as Node.js
rely on higher-level instrumentation but lack precision, as they cannot capture
the relevant underlying application flow. As a solution, we propose a
streamlined method for recovering the asynchronous execution path of requests
called the Nested Bounded Context Algorithm. The proposed technique tracks the
application execution flow through multiple layers and showcases it on an
interactive interface for further assessment.
<br />Furthermore, we introduce the vertical span concept. This representation of a
span as a multidimensional object (horizontal and vertical) with a start and
end of execution, along with its sub-layers and triggered operations, enables
the granular identification and diagnosis of performance issues. We proposed a
new technique called the Bounded Context Tracking Algorithm for event matching
and request reassembling in a multi-layer trace . The two techniques allow
aligning the executions of the request in a tree-based data structure for
developed visualisations. These visualisations permit performance debugging of
complex performance issues in Node.js.

<p class="mathjax">Dietary intake estimation plays a crucial role in understanding the
nutritional habits of individuals and populations, aiding in the prevention and
management of diet-related health issues. Accurate estimation requires
comprehensive datasets of food scenes, including images, segmentation masks,
and accompanying dietary intake metadata. In this paper, we introduce
NutritionVerse-Real, an open access manually collected 2D food scene dataset
for dietary intake estimation with 889 images of 251 distinct dishes and 45
unique food types. The NutritionVerse-Real dataset was created by manually
collecting images of food scenes in real life, measuring the weight of every
ingredient and computing the associated dietary content of each dish using the
ingredient weights and nutritional information from the food packaging or the
Canada Nutrient File. Segmentation masks were then generated through human
labelling of the images. We provide further analysis on the data diversity to
highlight potential biases when using this data to develop models for dietary
intake estimation. NutritionVerse-Real is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nutritionverse/nutritionverse-real as part of
an open initiative to accelerate machine learning for dietary sensing.

<p class="mathjax">We present a machine vision-based database named GrainSet for the purpose of
visual quality inspection of grain kernels. The database contains more than
350K single-kernel images with experts' annotations. The grain kernels used in
the study consist of four types of cereal grains including wheat, maize,
sorghum and rice, and were collected from over 20 regions in 5 countries. The
surface information of each kernel is captured by our custom-built device
equipped with high-resolution optic sensor units, and corresponding sampling
information and annotations include collection location and time, morphology,
physical size, weight, and Damage &amp; Unsound grain categories provided by senior
inspectors. In addition, we employed a commonly used deep learning model to
provide classification results as a benchmark. We believe that our GrainSet
will facilitate future research in fields such as assisting inspectors in grain
quality inspections, providing guidance for grain storage and trade, and
contributing to applications of smart agriculture.

<p class="mathjax">Bio-inspired neural networks have the potential to advance our understanding
of neural computation and improve the state-of-the-art of AI systems.
Bio-electrical synapses directly transmit neural signals, by enabling fast
current flow between neurons. In contrast, bio-chemical synapses transmit
neural signals indirectly, through neurotransmitters. Prior work showed that
interpretable dynamics for complex robotic control, can be achieved by using
chemical synapses, within a sparse, bio-inspired architecture, called Neural
Circuit Policies (NCPs). However, a comparison of these two synaptic models,
within the same architecture, remains an unexplored area. In this work we aim
to determine the impact of using chemical synapses compared to electrical
synapses, in both sparse and all-to-all connected networks. We conduct
experiments with autonomous lane-keeping through a photorealistic autonomous
driving simulator to evaluate their performance under diverse conditions and in
the presence of noise. The experiments highlight the substantial influence of
the architectural and synaptic-model choices, respectively. Our results show
that employing chemical synapses yields noticeable improvements compared to
electrical synapses, and that NCPs lead to better results in both synaptic
models.

<p class="mathjax">Modern data-driven machine learning system designs exploit inductive biases
on architectural structure, invariance and equivariance requirements, task
specific loss functions, and computational optimization tools. Previous works
have illustrated that inductive bias in the early layers of the encoder in the
form of human specified quasi-invariant filters can serve as a powerful
inductive bias to attain better robustness and transparency in learned
classifiers. This paper explores this further in the context of representation
learning with local plasticity rules i.e. bio-inspired Hebbian learning . We
propose a modular framework trained with a bio-inspired variant of contrastive
predictive coding (Hinge CLAPP Loss). Our framework is composed of parallel
encoders each leveraging a different invariant visual descriptor as an
inductive bias. We evaluate the representation learning capacity of our system
in a classification scenario on image data of various difficulties (GTSRB,
STL10, CODEBRIM) as well as video data (UCF101). Our findings indicate that
this form of inductive bias can be beneficial in closing the gap between models
with local plasticity rules and backpropagation models as well as learning more
robust representations in general.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation plays a critical role in enabling intelligent vehicles
to comprehend their surrounding environments. However, deep learning-based
methods usually perform poorly in domain shift scenarios due to the lack of
labeled data for training. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques have
emerged to bridge the gap across different driving scenes and enhance model
performance on unlabeled target environments. Although self-training UDA
methods have achieved state-of-the-art results, the challenge of generating
precise pseudo-labels persists. These pseudo-labels tend to favor majority
classes, consequently sacrificing the performance of rare classes or small
objects like traffic lights and signs. To address this challenge, we introduce
SAM4UDASS, a novel approach that incorporates the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
into self-training UDA methods for refining pseudo-labels. It involves
Semantic-Guided Mask Labeling, which assigns semantic labels to unlabeled SAM
masks using UDA pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we devise fusion strategies aimed
at mitigating semantic granularity inconsistency between SAM masks and the
target domain. SAM4UDASS innovatively integrate SAM with UDA for semantic
segmentation in driving scenes and seamlessly complements existing
self-training UDA methodologies. Extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real and
normal-to-adverse driving datasets demonstrate its effectiveness. It brings
more than 3% mIoU gains on GTA5-to-Cityscapes, SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, and
Cityscapes-to-ACDC when using DAFormer and achieves SOTA when using MIC. The
code will be available at https://github.com/ywher/SAM4UDASS.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies have shown that video-level representation learning is crucial
to the capture and understanding of the long-range temporal structure for video
action recognition. Most existing 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
methods for video-level representation learning are clip-based and focus only
on short-term motion and appearances. These CNN-based methods lack the capacity
to incorporate and model the long-range spatiotemporal representation of the
underlying video and ignore the long-range video-level context during training.
In this study, we propose a factorized 4D CNN architecture with attention (F4D)
that is capable of learning more effective, finer-grained, long-term
spatiotemporal video representations. We demonstrate that the proposed F4D
architecture yields significant performance improvements over the conventional
2D, and 3D CNN architectures proposed in the literature. Experiment evaluation
on five action recognition benchmark datasets, i.e., Something-Something-v1,
SomethingSomething-v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed F4D network architecture for video-level action
recognition.

<p class="mathjax">Connected and automated vehicles (CAV) are expected to deliver a much safer,
more efficient, and eco-friendlier mobility. Being an indispensable component
of the future transportation, their key driving features of CAVs include not
only the automated functionality but also the cooperative capability. Despite
the CAVs themselves are emerging and active research areas, there is a lack of
a comprehensive literature review on the digital infrastructure that enables
them. In this paper, we review the requirements and benefits of digital
infrastructures for the CAVs including the vehicle built-in, roadside-based,
operational and planning infrastructures. We then highlight challenges and
opportunities on digital infrastructure research for the CAVs. Our study sheds
lights on seamless integration of digital infrastructure for safe operations of
CAVs.

<p class="mathjax">Social video anomaly is an observation in video streams that does not conform
to a common pattern of dataset's behaviour. Social video anomaly detection
plays a critical role in applications from e-commerce to e-learning.
Traditionally, anomaly detection techniques are applied to find anomalies in
video broadcasting. However, they neglect the live social video streams which
contain interactive talk, speech, or lecture with audience. In this paper, we
propose a generic framework for effectively online detecting Anomalies Over
social Video LIve Streaming (AOVLIS). Specifically, we propose a novel deep
neural network model called Coupling Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) that
adaptively captures the history behaviours of the presenters and audience, and
their mutual interactions to predict their behaviour at next time point over
streams. Then we well integrate the CLSTM with a decoder layer, and propose a
new reconstruction error-based scoring function $RE_{IA}$ to calculate the
anomaly score of each video segment for anomaly detection. After that, we
propose a novel model update scheme that incrementally maintains CLSTM and
decoder. Moreover, we design a novel upper bound and ADaptive Optimisation
Strategy (ADOS) for improving the efficiency of our solution. Extensive
experiments are conducted to prove the superiority of AOVLIS.

<p class="mathjax">An accurate binding affinity prediction between T-cell receptors and epitopes
contributes decisively to develop successful immunotherapy strategies. Some
state-of-the-art computational methods implement deep learning techniques by
integrating evolutionary features to convert the amino acid residues of cell
receptors and epitope sequences into numerical values, while some other methods
employ pre-trained language models to summarize the embedding vectors at the
amino acid residue level to obtain sequence-wise representations.
<br />Here, we propose a highly reliable novel method, MATE-Pred, that performs
multi-modal attention-based prediction of T-cell receptors and epitopes binding
affinity. The MATE-Pred is compared and benchmarked with other deep learning
models that leverage multi-modal representations of T-cell receptors and
epitopes. In the proposed method, the textual representation of proteins is
embedded with a pre-trained bi-directional encoder model and combined with two
additional modalities: a) a comprehensive set of selected physicochemical
properties; b) predicted contact maps that estimate the 3D distances between
amino acid residues in the sequences.
<br />The MATE-Pred demonstrates the potential of multi-modal model in achieving
state-of-the-art performance (+8.4\% MCC, +5.5\% AUC compared to baselines) and
efficiently capturing contextual, physicochemical, and structural information
from amino acid residues. The performance of MATE-Pred projects its potential
application in various drug discovery regimes.

<p class="mathjax">We propose Wake-Sleep Consolidated Learning (WSCL), a learning strategy
leveraging Complementary Learning System theory and the wake-sleep phases of
the human brain to improve the performance of deep neural networks for visual
classification tasks in continual learning settings. Our method learns
continually via the synchronization between distinct wake and sleep phases.
During the wake phase, the model is exposed to sensory input and adapts its
representations, ensuring stability through a dynamic parameter freezing
mechanism and storing episodic memories in a short-term temporary memory
(similarly to what happens in the hippocampus). During the sleep phase, the
training process is split into NREM and REM stages. In the NREM stage, the
model's synaptic weights are consolidated using replayed samples from the
short-term and long-term memory and the synaptic plasticity mechanism is
activated, strengthening important connections and weakening unimportant ones.
In the REM stage, the model is exposed to previously-unseen realistic visual
sensory experience, and the dreaming process is activated, which enables the
model to explore the potential feature space, thus preparing synapses to future
knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three benchmark
datasets: CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet and FG-ImageNet. In all cases, our method
outperforms the baselines and prior work, yielding a significant performance
gain on continual visual classification tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
usefulness of all processing stages and the importance of dreaming to enable
positive forward transfer.

extended target with MCMC sampling, where a new shape basis selection is
proposed based on the shape derivative analysis for the measurement data. In
order to optimize the center and radius of the initial disk, we use the
monostatic sampling method for the center and the explicit scattered field
expression for disks for the radius. Numerical simulations are presented to
validate the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting and estimating size of apples during the early stages of growth is
crucial for predicting yield, pest management, and making informed decisions
related to crop-load management, harvest and post-harvest logistics, and
marketing. Traditional fruit size measurement methods are laborious and
time-consuming. This study employs the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection
and instance segmentation algorithm in conjunction with geometric shape fitting
techniques on 3D point cloud data to accurately determine the size of immature
green apples (or fruitlet) in a commercial orchard environment. The methodology
utilized two RGB-D sensors: the Intel RealSense D435i and the Microsoft Azure
Kinect DK. Notably, the YOLOv8 instance segmentation models exhibited
proficiency in immature green apple detection, with the YOLOv8m-seg model
clinching the highest AP@0.5 and AP@0.75 scores of 0.94 and 0.91, respectively.
Leveraging the ellipsoid fitting technique on images from the Azure Kinect, we
observed remarkable metrics, including an RMSE of 2.35, MAE of 1.66, MAPE of
6.15, and an R-squared value of 0.9. Challenges such as partial occlusion,
where YOLOv8 sometimes misinterpreted immature green apple clusters, were
recognized. In a comparison of 102 outdoor samples, the Microsoft Azure Kinect
showed better performance than the Intel Realsense D435i, as supported by the
MAE data. This study emphasizes the combined effectiveness of shape-fitting
methods and 3D sensors in improving fruitlet sizing for agriculture.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the emergence of the first quantum computers at a time when
AI is undergoing a fruitful era has led many AI researchers to be tempted into
adapting their algorithms to run on a quantum computer. However, in many cases
the initial enthusiasm has ended in frustration, since the features and
principles underlying quantum computing are very different from traditional
computers. In this paper, we present a discussion of the difficulties arising
when designing a quantum version of an evolutionary algorithm based on Darwin's
evolutionary mechanism, the so-called genetic algorithms. The paper includes
the code in both Python and QISKIT of the quantum version of one of these
evolutionary algorithms allowing the reader to experience the setbacks arising
when translating a classical algorithm to its quantum version. The algorithm
studied in this paper, termed RQGA (Reduced Quantum Genetic Algorithm), has
been chosen as an example that clearly shows these difficulties, which are
common to other AI algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">A fundamental trait of intelligence involves finding novel and creative
solutions to address a given challenge or to adapt to unforeseen situations.
Reflecting this, Quality-Diversity optimization is a family of Evolutionary
Algorithms, that generates collections of both diverse and high-performing
solutions. Among these, MAP-Elites is a prominent example, that has been
successfully applied to a variety of domains, including evolutionary robotics.
However, MAP-Elites performs a divergent search with random mutations
originating from Genetic Algorithms, and thus, is limited to evolving
populations of low-dimensional solutions. PGA-MAP-Elites overcomes this
limitation using a gradient-based variation operator inspired by deep
reinforcement learning which enables the evolution of large neural networks.
Although high-performing in many environments, PGA-MAP-Elites fails on several
tasks where the convergent search of the gradient-based variation operator
hinders diversity. In this work, we present three contributions: (1) we enhance
the Policy Gradient variation operator with a descriptor-conditioned critic
that reconciles diversity search with gradient-based methods, (2) we leverage
the actor-critic training to learn a descriptor-conditioned policy at no
additional cost, distilling the knowledge of the population into one single
versatile policy that can execute a diversity of behaviors, (3) we exploit the
descriptor-conditioned actor by injecting it in the population, despite network
architecture differences. Our method, DCG-MAP-Elites, achieves equal or higher
QD score and coverage compared to all baselines on seven challenging continuous
control locomotion tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate jamming-resilient UAV path planning strategies
for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, in which the typical
UAV can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming attacks.
Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect data from multiple
distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance, mission completion deadline,
and kinematic constraints in the presence of jamming attacks. We first design a
fixed ground jammer with continuous jamming attack and periodical jamming
attack strategies to jam the link between the typical UAV and IoT nodes.
Defensive strategies involving a reinforcement learning (RL) based virtual
jammer and the adoption of higher SINR thresholds are proposed to counteract
against such attacks. Secondly, we design an intelligent UAV jammer, which
utilizes the RL algorithm to choose actions based on its observation. Then, an
intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal with such attacks,
and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is obtained via dueling double
deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results show that both non-intelligent and
intelligent jamming attacks have significant influence on the UAV's
performance, and the proposed defense strategies can recover the performance
close to that in no-jammer scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of tiny AI accelerators opens opportunities for deep neural
network deployment at the extreme edge, offering reduced latency, lower power
cost, and improved privacy in on-device ML inference. Despite these
advancements, challenges persist due to inherent limitations of these
accelerators, such as restricted onboard memory and single-device focus. This
paper introduces Synergy, a system that dynamically composes tiny AI
accelerators for multi-tenant models, effectively addressing tinyML's critical
challenges for the increasing demand for on-device AI. A key feature of Synergy
is its virtual computing space, providing a unified, virtualized view of
resources and enabling efficient task mapping to physical devices. Synergy's
runtime orchestration module ensures optimal inference across dynamic and
heterogeneous accelerators. Our evaluations with 7 baselines and 8 models
demonstrate that Synergy improves throughput by an average of 8.0X compared to
baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models excel at producing high-quality samples but naively require
hundreds of iterations, prompting multiple attempts to distill the generation
process into a faster network. However, many existing approaches suffer from a
variety of challenges: the process for distillation training can be complex,
often requiring multiple training stages, and the resulting models perform
poorly when utilized in single-step generative applications. In this paper, we
introduce a simple yet effective means of distilling diffusion models directly
from initial noise to the resulting image. Of particular importance to our
approach is to leverage a new Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) model as the distilled
architecture: the Generative Equilibrium Transformer (GET). Our method enables
fully offline training with just noise/image pairs from the diffusion model
while achieving superior performance compared to existing one-step methods on
comparable training budgets. We demonstrate that the DEQ architecture is
crucial to this capability, as GET matches a $5\times$ larger ViT in terms of
FID scores while striking a critical balance of computational cost and image
quality. Code, checkpoints, and datasets are available.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid development of automated driving systems in recent years has led to
improvements in road safety and travel comfort. One typical function of these
systems is Lane Keep Assist, which generally does not take human driving
preferences into account. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that it is
possible to implement a Lane Keep Assist function that is appropriate to human
preferences using a trajectory planning algorithm based on a linear driving
model. In our current work, we investigated how to separate the driving styles
of individual drivers. We assumed that there are three driving styles: sporty,
neutral and defensive. To prove these relations, clustering methods were
applied to previously recorded measurements . Simulations with parameters
describing the average behaviour of the classes (re-simulated with clustered
types) showed that the resulting paths successfully classified drivers, that
the 3 classes are distinct in their behaviour and that our model reproduces
these behaviours.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous shuttles (AS) operate in several cities and have shown potential
to improve the public transport network. However, there is no car following
model that is based on field data and allows decision-makers to assess and plan
for AS operations. To fill this gap, this study collected field data from AS,
analyzed their driving performance, and suggested changes in the AS trajectory
model to improve passenger comfort. A sample was collected with more than 4000
seconds of AS following a conventional car. The sample contained GPS positions
from both AS and conventional vehicles. Latitude and longitude positions were
used to calculate the speed, acceleration, and jerk of the leader and follower.
The data analyses indicated that AS have higher jerk values that may impact the
passengers comfort. Several existing models were evaluated, and the researchers
concluded that the calibrated ACC model resulted in lower errors for AS spacing
and speed. The results of the calibration indicate that the AS has lower peak
acceleration and higher deceleration than the parameters that were calibrated
for autonomous vehicle models in other research

<p class="mathjax">Soft and lightweight grippers have greatly enhanced the performance of
robotic manipulators in handling complex objects with varying shape, texture,
and stiffness. However, the combination of universal grasping with passive
sensing capabilities still presents challenges. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a fluidic soft gripper, named the ``Pac-Man'' gripper, based on the
buckling of soft, thin hemispherical shells. Leveraging a single fluidic
pressure input, the soft gripper can encapsulate slippery and delicate objects
while passively providing information on this physical interaction. Guided by
analytical, numerical, and experimental tools, we explore the novel grasping
principle of this mechanics-based soft gripper. First, we characterize the
buckling behavior of a free hemisphere as a function of its geometric
parameters. Inspired by the free hemisphere's two-lobe mode shape ideal for
grasping purposes, we demonstrate that the gripper can perform dexterous
manipulation and gentle gripping of fragile objects in confined environments.
Last, we prove the soft gripper's embedded capability of detecting contact,
grasping, and release conditions during the interaction with an unknown object.
This simple buckling-based soft gripper opens new avenues for the design of
adaptive gripper morphologies with applications ranging from medical and
agricultural robotics to space and underwater exploration.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) capture the information processing mechanism
of the brain by taking advantage of spiking neurons, such as the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model neuron, which incorporates temporal dynamics and
transmits information via discrete and asynchronous spikes. However, the
simplified biological properties of LIF ignore the neuronal coupling and
dendritic structure of real neurons, which limits the spatio-temporal dynamics
of neurons and thus reduce the expressive power of the resulting SNNs. In this
work, we leverage a more biologically plausible neural model with complex
dynamics, i.e., a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN), to improve the
expressiveness and recognition performance of SNNs for vision tasks. The PCNN
is a type of cortical model capable of emulating the complex neuronal
activities in the primary visual cortex. We construct deep pulse-coupled neural
networks (DPCNNs) by replacing commonly used LIF neurons in SNNs with PCNN
neurons. The intra-coupling in existing PCNN models limits the coupling between
neurons only within channels. To address this limitation, we propose
inter-channel coupling, which allows neurons in different feature maps to
interact with each other. Experimental results show that inter-channel coupling
can efficiently boost performance with fewer neurons, synapses, and less
training time compared to widening the networks. For instance, compared to the
LIF-based SNN with wide VGG9, DPCNN with VGG9 uses only 50%, 53%, and 73% of
neurons, synapses, and training time, respectively. Furthermore, we propose
receptive field and time dependent batch normalization (RFTD-BN) to speed up
the convergence and performance of DPCNNs.

<p class="mathjax">Spot beamfocusing (SBF) is the process of focusing the signal power in a
small spot-like region in the 3D space, which can be either hard-tuned (HT)
using traditional tools like lenses and mirrors or electronically reconfigured
(ER) using modern large-scale intelligent surface phased arrays. ER-SBF can be
a key enabling technology (KET) for the next-generation 6G wireless networks
offering benefits to many future wireless application areas such as wireless
communication and security, mid-range wireless chargers, medical and health,
physics, etc. Although near-field HT-SBF and ER-beamfocusing have been studied
in the literature and applied in the industry, there is no comprehensive study
of different aspects of ER-SBF and its future applications, especially for
nonoptical (mmWave, sub-THz, and THz) electromagnetic waves in the next
generation wireless technology, which is the aim of this paper. The theoretical
concepts behind ER-SBF, different antenna technologies for implementing ER-SBF,
employing machine learning (ML)-based schemes for enabling
channel-state-information (CSI)-independent ER-SBF, and different practical
application areas that can benefit from ER-SBF will be explored.

<p class="mathjax">As coin-based rewards dwindle, transaction fees play an important role as
mining incentives in Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism
called Efficient Dynamic Transaction Storage (EDTS) for dynamically allocating
transactions among blocks to achieve efficient storage utilization. By
leveraging a combination of Cuckoo Filter and Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS)
strategies, EDTS is able to improve the scalability while remaining sustainable
even after the Bitcoin enters a transaction-fee regime. In addition to
preventing deviant mining behaviors under the transaction-fee regime, EDTS can
also provide differentiated transmission priorities based on transaction fees
while allowing the investors to engage in pledging more transaction fees. In
EDTS, we applied the multi-objective optimization algorithm U-NSGA-III to find
the best DTS strategy and its corresponding attributes. Experimental results
show that the EDTS mechanism together with the optimized DTS strategy can
achieve a throughput of 325.3 TPS. The experimental results reveal that the
scalability improvement of EDTS is superior to the performance of Bitcoin NG,
which is the best known on-chain scaling solution, while maintaining the
sustainability under the transaction-fee regime.

<p class="mathjax">The concept of a digital twin (DT) plays a pivotal role in the ongoing
digital transformation and has achieved significant strides for various
wireless applications in recent years. In particular, the field of autonomous
vehicles is a domain that is ripe for exploiting the concept of DT.
Nevertheless, there are many challenges that include holistic consideration and
integration of hardware, software, communication methods, and collaboration of
edge/cloud computing. In this paper, an end-to-end (E2E) real-world smart
mobility DT is designed and implemented for the purpose of autonomous driving.
The proposed system utilizes roadside units (RSUs) and edge computing to
capture real-world traffic information, which is then processed in the cloud to
create a DT model. This DT model is then exploited to enable route planning
services for the autonomous vehicle to avoid heavy traffic. Real-world
experimental results show that the system reliability can reach 99.53% while
achieving a latency that is 3.36% below the 3GPP recommended value of 100 ms
for autonomous driving. These results clearly validate the effectiveness of the
system according to practical 3GPP standards for sensor and state map sharing
(SSMS) and information sharing.

attracted increasing attention, because they promise to create a highly
efficient and safe transportation system in the future. Meanwhile, digital
twin, as an emerging technology, will play an important role in automated
driving and intelligent transportation systems. This technology is applied in
this paper to design a platform for smart mobility, providing large-scale route

build a digital twin system model that reflects the static and dynamic objects
from the real world in real time. With the smart mobility platform, we realize

<p class="mathjax">Speech-driven 3D facial animation is challenging due to the scarcity of
large-scale visual-audio datasets despite extensive research. Most prior works,
typically focused on learning regression models on a small dataset using the
method of least squares, encounter difficulties generating diverse lip
movements from speech and require substantial effort in refining the generated
outputs. To address these issues, we propose a speech-driven 3D facial
animation with a diffusion model (SAiD), a lightweight Transformer-based U-Net
with a cross-modality alignment bias between audio and visual to enhance lip
synchronization. Moreover, we introduce BlendVOCA, a benchmark dataset of pairs
of speech audio and parameters of a blendshape facial model, to address the
scarcity of public resources. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves comparable or superior performance in lip
synchronization to baselines, ensures more diverse lip movements, and
streamlines the animation editing process.

contemporary applications in learning, societal repercussions, and strategic
recommendations for researchers. We propose ways in which generative AI can
transform the educational landscape, primarily via its ability to conduct

We also address the challenges of effective educational tool deployment, data

societal impact, we emphasize the need for updating curricula, redefining
communicative trust, and adjusting to transformed social norms. We end by
outlining the ways in which educational stakeholders can actively engage with

<p class="mathjax">This study compared the classification performance of Gemini Pro and GPT-4V
in educational settings. Employing visual question answering (VQA) techniques,
the study examined both models' abilities to read text-based rubrics and then
automatically score student-drawn models in science education. We employed both
quantitative and qualitative analyses using a dataset derived from
student-drawn scientific models and employing NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubrics
for Image Feedback) prompting methods. The findings reveal that GPT-4V
significantly outperforms Gemini Pro in terms of scoring accuracy and Quadratic
Weighted Kappa. The qualitative analysis reveals that the differences may be
due to the models' ability to process fine-grained texts in images and overall
image classification performance. Even adapting the NERIF approach by further
de-sizing the input images, Gemini Pro seems not able to perform as well as
GPT-4V. The findings suggest GPT-4V's superior capability in handling complex
multimodal educational tasks. The study concludes that while both models
represent advancements in AI, GPT-4V's higher performance makes it a more
suitable tool for educational applications involving multimodal data
interpretation.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to prevent accidents caused by
drivers' error and reduce road traffic risks. Due to the nature of heavy
vehicles, whose collisions cause more serious crashes, the weights of vehicles
need to be considered when making driving strategies aimed at reducing the
potential risks and their consequences in the context of autonomous driving.
This study develops an autonomous driving strategy based on risk anticipation,
considering the weights of surrounding vehicles and using hierarchical deep
reinforcement learning. A risk indicator integrating surrounding vehicles'
weights, based on the risk field theory, is proposed and incorporated into
autonomous driving decisions. A hybrid action space is designed to allow for
left lane changes, right lane changes and car-following, which enables AVs to
act more freely and realistically whenever possible. To solve the above hybrid
decision-making problem, a hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO)
algorithm is developed and an attention mechanism is incorporated, providing
great advantages in maintaining stable performance. An indicator, potential
collision energy in conflicts (PCEC), is newly proposed to evaluate the
performance of the developed AV driving strategy from both the perspectives of
the likelihood and the consequences of potential accidents. An application is
carried out and the simulation results demonstrate that our model provides
driving strategies that reduce both the likelihood and consequences of
potential accidents, at the same time maintaining driving efficiency. The
developed method is especially meaningful for AVs driving on highways, where
heavy vehicles make up a high proportion of the traffic.

<p class="mathjax">A conception of mobile edge generation (MEG) is proposed, where generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models are distributed at edge servers (ESs) and
user equipment (UE), enabling joint execution of generation tasks. Various
distributed deployment schemes of the GAI model are proposed to alleviate the
immense network load and long user queuing times for accessing GAI models. Two
MEG frameworks are proposed, namely the single-ES framework and the multi-ESs
framework. 1) A one-to-one joint generation framework between an ES and a UE is
proposed, including four specific single-ES MEG protocols. These protocols
allow distributed GAI models to transmit seeds or sketches for delivering
information efficiently. 2) Several protocols are proposed for multi-ESs MEG,
which enable multiple ESs to perform the generation task cooperatively or in
parallel. Finally, a case study of a text-guided-image-to-image generation is
provided, where a latent diffusion model is distributed at an ES and a UE. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocols are able to generate
high-quality images at extremely low signal-to-noise ratios. The proposed
protocols can significantly reduce the communication overhead compared to the
centralized model.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a methodology for constructing data-driven maneuver
generation models for agile aircraft that can generalize across a wide range of
trim conditions and aircraft model parameters. Maneuver generation models play
a crucial role in the testing and evaluation of aircraft prototypes, providing
insights into the maneuverability and agility of the aircraft. However,
constructing the models typically requires extensive amounts of real pilot
data, which can be time-consuming and costly to obtain. Moreover, models built
with limited data often struggle to generalize beyond the specific flight
conditions covered in the original dataset. To address these challenges, we
propose a hybrid architecture that leverages a simulation model, referred to as
the source model. This open-source agile aircraft simulator shares similar
dynamics with the target aircraft and allows us to generate unlimited data for
building a proxy maneuver generation model. We then fine-tune this model to the
target aircraft using a limited amount of real pilot data. Our approach
combines techniques from imitation learning, transfer learning, and
reinforcement learning to achieve this objective. To validate our methodology,
we utilize real agile pilot data provided by Turkish Aerospace Industries
(TAI). By employing the F-16 as the source model, we demonstrate that it is
possible to construct a maneuver generation model that generalizes across
various trim conditions and aircraft parameters without requiring any
additional real pilot data. Our results showcase the effectiveness of our
approach in developing robust and adaptable models for agile aircraft.

<p class="mathjax">Online education platforms, leveraging the internet to distribute education
resources, seek to provide convenient education but often fall short in
real-time communication with students. They often struggle to offer
personalized education resources due to the challenge of addressing the diverse
obstacles students encounter throughout their learning journey. Recently, the
emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offers the
possibility for resolving this issue by comprehending individual requests.
Although LLMs have been successful in various fields, creating an LLM-based
education system is still challenging for the wide range of educational skills
required. This paper reviews the recently emerged LLM researches related to
educational capabilities, including mathematics, writing, programming,
reasoning, and knowledge-based question answering, with the aim to explore
their potential in constructing the next-generation intelligent education
system. Based on the current development status, we further outline two
approaches for an LLM-based education system: a unified approach and a
mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach. Finally, we explore the challenges and future
directions, providing new research opportunities and perspectives on adapting
LLMs for education.

<p class="mathjax">The P vs. NP problem, a cornerstone of computational theory, continues to
elude resolution, traditionally approached through mathematical logic and
algorithmic theory. This paper ventures beyond these confines, weaving together
information theory, thermodynamics, and computational complexity to unveil a
rich landscape of interdisciplinary intersections. Central to our discourse is
the concept of entropy, examined through its information-theoretic subtleties
and thermodynamic implications, particularly in relation to computational
'hardness'. We introduce Entropy-Driven Annealing (EDA) as a novel mechanism to
elucidate the energy landscapes underlying computational problems, focusing on
the inherent nature of NP problems. This approach hypothesizes a distinct
thermodynamic profile for NP problems compared to P problems and speculates on
possible thermodynamic pathways for polynomial-time solutions to NP challenges.
The exploration extends to the practical application of EDA in studying
protein-DNA complexes, grounding theoretical constructs in a biological
context. While the P vs. NP conundrum remains unsolved, this interdisciplinary
foray offers a fresh and insightful perspective on fundamental computational
dilemmas, marking a step towards unraveling this complex puzzle.

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to be effective in producing
approximate solutions to some vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially when
using policies generated by encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. While these
techniques have been quite successful for relatively simple problem instances,
there are still under-researched and highly complex VRP variants for which no
effective RL method has been demonstrated. In this work we focus on one such
VRP variant, which contains multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements.
In these problems, demand is required to move along sequences of nodes, instead
of just from a start node to an end node. With the goal of making deep RL a
viable strategy for real-world industrial-scale supply chain logistics, we
develop new extensions to existing encoder-decoder attention models which allow
them to handle multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements. Our models
have the advantage that they can be trained for a small number of trucks and
nodes, and then embedded into a large supply chain to yield solutions for
larger numbers of trucks and nodes. We test our approach on a real supply chain
environment arising in the operations of Japanese automotive parts manufacturer
Aisin Corporation, and find that our algorithm outperforms Aisin's previous
best solution.

<p class="mathjax">The deployment and scaling of large language models (LLMs) have become
critical as they permeate various applications, demanding high-throughput and
low-latency serving systems. Existing frameworks struggle to balance these
requirements, especially for workloads with long prompts. This paper introduces
DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that employs Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and
generation composition strategy, to deliver up to 2.3x higher effective
throughput, 2x lower latency on average, and up to 3.7x lower (token-level)
tail latency, compared to state-of-the-art systems like vLLM. We leverage a
synergistic combination of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide an
efficient and easy-to-use serving system for LLMs. DeepSpeed-FastGen's advanced
implementation supports a range of models and offers both non-persistent and
persistent deployment options, catering to diverse user scenarios from
interactive sessions to long-running applications. We present a detailed
benchmarking methodology, analyze the performance through latency-throughput
curves, and investigate scalability via load balancing. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various
models and hardware configurations. We discuss our roadmap for future
enhancements, including broader model support and new hardware backends. The
DeepSpeed-FastGen code is readily available for community engagement and
contribution.

<p class="mathjax">Discussion of AI alignment (alignment between humans and AI systems) has
focused on value alignment, broadly referring to creating AI systems that share
human values. We argue that before we can even attempt to align values, it is
imperative that AI systems and humans align the concepts they use to understand
the world. We integrate ideas from philosophy, cognitive science, and deep
learning to explain the need for concept alignment, not just value alignment,
between humans and machines. We summarize existing accounts of how humans and
machines currently learn concepts, and we outline opportunities and challenges
in the path towards shared concepts. Finally, we explain how we can leverage
the tools already being developed in cognitive science and AI research to
accelerate progress towards concept alignment.

<p class="mathjax">Crowdsourcing data science competitions has become popular as a
cost-effective alternative to solving complex energy-related challenges.
How-ever, comprehensive reviews on hosting processes remain scarce. Therefore,
this paper undertakes a detailed review of 33 existing data competitions and 12
hosting platforms, complemented by an in-depth case study of the ADRENALIN load
disaggregation competition. The review identifies essential elements of
competition procedure, including platform selection, timeline, datasets, and
submission and evaluation mechanisms. Based on proposed 16 evaluation criteria,
the similarities and differences between data competition hosting platforms can
be categorized into platform scoring and popularity, platform features,
community engagement, open-source platforms, region-specific platforms,
platform-specific purposes, and multi-purpose platforms. The case study
underscores strategic planning's critical role, particularly platform
selection. The case study also shows the importance of defining competition
scope which influences the whole com-petition content and procedure, especially
the datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The design and optimization of hardware have traditionally been
resource-intensive, demanding considerable expertise and dependence on
established design automation tools. This paper discusses the possibility of
exploiting large language models to streamline the code generation process in
hardware design. In contrast to earlier studies, this paper aims to use large
language models that accepts high-level design specifications through a single
prompt to generate corresponding Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code. The
ability to use large language models on RTL code generation not only expedites
design iteration cycles but also facilitates the exploration of design spaces
that have computational challenges for conventional techniques. Through our
evaluation, we demonstrate the shortcoming of existing attention mechanisms,
and present the abilities of language models to produce functional, optimized,
and industry-standard compliant RTL code when a novel attention mechanism is
used. These findings underscore the expanding role of large language models in
shaping the future landscape of architectural exploration and automation in
hardware design.

The emergence of these often rarely occurring defect patterns explains the

inspection, this contribution proposes a DifferNet-based solution enhanced with
attention modules utilizing SENet and CBAM as backbone - AttentDifferNet - to
improve the detection and classification capabilities on three different visual
inspection and anomaly detection datasets: MVTec AD, InsPLAD-fault, and
Semiconductor Wafer. In comparison to the current state of the art, it is shown
that AttentDifferNet achieves improved results, which are, in turn, highlighted
throughout our quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation, indicated by a
general improvement in AUC of 94.34 vs. 92.46, 96.67 vs. 94.69, and 90.20 vs.
88.74%. As our variants to AttentDifferNet show great prospects in the context
of currently investigated approaches, a baseline is formulated, emphasizing the
importance of attention for anomaly detection.

<p class="mathjax">Camera-only Bird's Eye View (BEV) has demonstrated great potential in
environment perception in a 3D space. However, most existing studies were
conducted under a supervised setup which cannot scale well while handling
various new data. Unsupervised domain adaptive BEV, which effective learning
from various unlabelled target data, is far under-explored. In this work, we
design DA-BEV, the first domain adaptive camera-only BEV framework that
addresses domain adaptive BEV challenges by exploiting the complementary nature
of image-view features and BEV features. DA-BEV introduces the idea of query
into the domain adaptation framework to derive useful information from
image-view and BEV features. It consists of two query-based designs, namely,
query-based adversarial learning (QAL) and query-based self-training (QST),
which exploits image-view features or BEV features to regularize the adaptation
of the other. Extensive experiments show that DA-BEV achieves superior domain
adaptive BEV perception performance consistently across multiple datasets and
tasks such as 3D object detection and 3D scene segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial part of deploying machine
learning models safely. It has been extensively studied with a plethora of
methods developed in the literature. This problem is tackled with an OOD score
computation, however, previous methods compute the OOD scores with limited
usage of the in-distribution dataset. For instance, the OOD scores are computed
with information from a small portion of the in-distribution data. Furthermore,
these methods encode images with a neural image encoder. The robustness of
these methods is rarely checked with respect to image encoders of different
training methods and architectures. In this work, we introduce the diffusion
process into the OOD task. The diffusion model integrates information on the
whole training set into the predicted noise vectors. What's more, we deduce a
closed-form solution for the noise vector (stable point). Then the noise vector
is converted into our OOD score, we test both the deep model predicted noise
vector and the closed-form noise vector on the OOD benchmarks \cite{openood}.
Our method outperforms previous OOD methods across all types of image encoders
(Table. \ref{main}). A $3.5\%$ performance gain is achieved with the MAE-based
image encoder. Moreover, we studied the robustness of OOD methods by applying
different types of image encoders. Some OOD methods failed to generalize well
when switching image encoders from ResNet to Vision Transformers, our method
performs exhibits good robustness with all the image encoders.

<p class="mathjax">As one of the most effective self-supervised representation learning methods,
contrastive learning (CL) relies on multiple negative pairs to contrast against
each positive pair. In the standard practice of contrastive learning, data
augmentation methods are utilized to generate both positive and negative pairs.
While existing works have been focusing on improving the positive sampling, the
negative sampling process is often overlooked. In fact, the generated negative
samples are often polluted by positive samples, which leads to a biased loss
and performance degradation. To correct the negative sampling bias, we propose
a novel contrastive learning method named Positive-Unlabeled Contrastive
Learning (PUCL). PUCL treats the generated negative samples as unlabeled
samples and uses information from positive samples to correct bias in
contrastive loss. We prove that the corrected loss used in PUCL only incurs a
negligible bias compared to the unbiased contrastive loss. PUCL can be applied
to general contrastive learning problems and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on various image and graph classification tasks. The code of PUCL is in
the supplementary file.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models have emerged as prime candidates to tackle
misinformation mitigation. However, existing approaches struggle with
hallucinations and overconfident predictions. We propose an uncertainty
quantification framework that leverages both direct confidence elicitation and
sampled-based consistency methods to provide better calibration for NLP
misinformation mitigation solutions. We first investigate the calibration of
sample-based consistency methods that exploit distinct features of consistency
across sample sizes and stochastic levels. Next, we evaluate the performance
and distributional shift of a robust numeric verbalization prompt across single
vs. two-step confidence elicitation procedure. We also compare the performance
of the same prompt with different versions of GPT and different numerical
scales. Finally, we combine the sample-based consistency and verbalized methods
to propose a hybrid framework that yields a better uncertainty estimation for
GPT models. Overall, our work proposes novel uncertainty quantification methods
that will improve the reliability of Large Language Models in misinformation
mitigation applications.

<p class="mathjax">Although data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) in medical image diagnosis
has shown impressive performance in silico, the lack of interpretability makes
it difficult to incorporate the "black box" into clinicians' workflows. To make
the diagnostic patterns learned from data understandable by clinicians, we
develop an interpretable model, knowledge-guided diagnosis model (KGDM), that
provides a visualized reasoning process containing AI-based biomarkers and
retrieved cases that with the same diagnostic patterns. It embraces clinicians'
prompts into the interpreted reasoning through human-AI interaction, leading to
potentially enhanced safety and more accurate predictions. This study
investigates the performance, interpretability, and clinical utility of KGDM in
the diagnosis of infectious keratitis (IK), which is the leading cause of
corneal blindness. The classification performance of KGDM is evaluated on a
prospective validation dataset, an external testing dataset, and an publicly
available testing dataset. The diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) of the interpreted
AI-based biomarkers are effective, ranging from 3.011 to 35.233 and exhibit
consistent diagnostic patterns with clinic experience. Moreover, a human-AI
collaborative diagnosis test is conducted and the participants with
collaboration achieved a performance exceeding that of both humans and AI. By
synergistically integrating interpretability and interaction, this study
facilitates the convergence of clinicians' expertise and data-driven
intelligence. The promotion of inexperienced ophthalmologists with the aid of
AI-based biomarkers, as well as increased AI prediction by intervention from
experienced ones, demonstrate a promising diagnostic paradigm for infectious
keratitis using KGDM, which holds the potential for extension to other diseases
where experienced medical practitioners are limited and the safety of AI is
concerned.

<p class="mathjax">High-level synthesis (HLS) notably speeds up the hardware design process by
avoiding RTL programming. However, the turnaround time of HLS increases
significantly when post-route quality of results (QoR) are considered during
optimization. To tackle this issue, we propose a hierarchical post-route QoR
prediction approach for FPGA HLS, which features: (1) a modeling flow that
directly estimates latency and post-route resource usage from C/C++ programs;
(2) a graph construction method that effectively represents the control and
data flow graph of source code and effects of HLS pragmas; and (3) a
hierarchical GNN training and prediction method capable of capturing the impact
of loop hierarchies. Experimental results show that our method presents a
prediction error of less than 10% for different types of QoR metrics, which
gains tremendous improvement compared with the state-of-the-art GNN methods. By
adopting our proposed methodology, the runtime for design space exploration in
HLS is shortened to tens of minutes and the achieved ADRS is reduced to 6.91%
on average.

<p class="mathjax">Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a task that continually adapts a pre-trained
source model to the target domain during inference. One popular approach
involves fine-tuning model with cross-entropy loss according to estimated
pseudo-labels. However, its performance is significantly affected by noisy
pseudo-labels. This study reveals that minimizing the classification error of
each sample causes the cross-entropy loss's vulnerability to label noise. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Decoupled Prototype Learning (DPL)
method that features prototype-centric loss computation. First, we decouple the
optimization of class prototypes. For each class prototype, we reduce its
distance with positive samples and enlarge its distance with negative samples
in a contrastive manner. This strategy prevents the model from overfitting to
noisy pseudo-labels. Second, we propose a memory-based strategy to enhance
DPL's robustness for the small batch sizes often encountered in TTA. We update
each class's pseudo-feature from a memory in a momentum manner and insert an
additional DPL loss. Finally, we introduce a consistency regularization-based
approach to leverage samples with unconfident pseudo-labels. This approach
transfers feature styles of samples with unconfident pseudo-labels to those
with confident pseudo-labels. Thus, more reliable samples for TTA are created.
The experimental results demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance on domain generalization benchmarks, and reliably improve the
performance of self-training-based methods on image corruption benchmarks. The
code will be released.

<p class="mathjax">We present hardware/software techniques to intelligently regulate supply
voltage and clock frequency of intermittently-computing devices. These devices
rely on ambient energy harvesting to power their operation and small capacitors
as energy buffers. Statically setting their clock frequency fails to capture
the unique relations these devices expose between capacitor voltage, energy
efficiency at a given operating frequency, and the corresponding operating
range. Existing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling techniques are also
largely inapplicable due to extreme energy scarcity and peculiar hardware
features. We introduce two hardware/software co-designs that accommodate the
distinct hardware features and function within a constrained energy envelope,
offering varied trade-offs and functionalities. Our experimental evaluation
combines tests on custom-manufactured hardware and detailed emulation
experiments. The data gathered indicate that our approaches result in up to
3.75x reduced energy consumption and 12x swifter execution times compared to
the considered baselines, all while utilizing smaller capacitors to accomplish
identical workloads.

<p class="mathjax">This study explores how discussing metaphors for AI can help build awareness
of the frames that shape our understanding of AI systems, particularly large
language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Given the pressing need to teach "critical
AI literacy", discussion of metaphor provides an opportunity for inquiry and
dialogue with space for nuance, playfulness, and critique. Using a
collaborative autoethnographic methodology, we analyzed metaphors from a range
of sources, and reflected on them individually according to seven questions,
then met and discussed our interpretations. We then analyzed how our
reflections contributed to the three kinds of literacies delineated in Selber's
multiliteracies framework: functional, critical, and rhetorical. These allowed
us to analyze questions of ethics, equity, and accessibility in relation to AI.
We explored each metaphor along the dimension of whether or not it was
promoting anthropomorphizing, and to what extent such metaphors imply that AI
is sentient. Our findings highlight the role of metaphor reflection in
fostering a nuanced understanding of AI, suggesting that our collaborative
autoethnographic approach as well as the heuristic model of plotting AI
metaphors on dimensions of anthropomorphism and multiliteracies, might be
useful for educators and researchers in the pursuit of advancing critical AI
literacy.

<p class="mathjax">Structured hand gestures that incorporate visual motions and signs are used
in sign language. Sign language is a valuable means of daily communication for
individuals who are deaf or have speech impairments, but it is still rare among
hearing people, and fewer are capable of understand it. Within the academic
context, parents and teachers play a crucial role in supporting deaf students
from childhood by facilitating their learning of sign language. In the last
years, among all the teaching tools useful for learning sign language, the use
of Virtual Reality (VR) has increased, as it has been demonstrated to improve
retention, memory and attention during the learning process. The ISENSE project
has been created to assist students with deafness during their academic life by
proposing different technological tools for teaching sign language to the
hearing community in the academic context. As part of the ISENSE project, this
work aims to develop an application for Spanish and Italian sign language
recognition that exploits the VR environment to quickly and easily create a
comprehensive database of signs and an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based
software to accurately classify and recognize static and dynamic signs: from
letters to sentences.

<p class="mathjax">Considering data insufficiency in metal additive manufacturing (AM), transfer
learning (TL) has been adopted to extract knowledge from source domains (e.g.,
completed printings) to improve the modeling performance in target domains
(e.g., new printings). Current applications use all accessible source data
directly in TL with no regard to the similarity between source and target data.
This paper proposes a systematic method to find appropriate subsets of source
data based on similarities between the source and target datasets for a given
set of limited target domain data. Such similarity is characterized by the
spatial and model distance metrics. A Pareto frontier-based source data
selection method is developed, where the source data located on the Pareto
frontier defined by two similarity distance metrics are selected iteratively.
The method is integrated into an instance-based TL method (decision tree
regression model) and a model-based TL method (fine-tuned artificial neural
network). Both models are then tested on several regression tasks in metal AM.
Comparison results demonstrate that 1) the source data selection method is
general and supports integration with various TL methods and distance metrics,
2) compared with using all source data, the proposed method can find a small
subset of source data from the same domain with better TL performance in metal
AM regression tasks involving different processes and machines, and 3) when
multiple source domains exist, the source data selection method could find the
subset from one source domain to obtain comparable or better TL performance
than the model constructed using data from all source domains.

and elevation. Recent advancements include data-driven models with inputs
derived from ambisonics intensity vectors or correlations between channels in a
microphone array. A spherical intensity map (SIM), or acoustic image, is an
alternative input representation that remains underexplored. SIMs benefit from
high-resolution microphone arrays, yet most DoAE datasets use low-resolution
ones. Therefore, we first propose a super-resolution method to upsample
low-resolution microphones. Next, we benchmark DoAE models that use SIMs as

a baseline and a state-of-the-art model. Our study highlights the relevance of

<p class="mathjax">Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of a code is a crucial task in
computer science and software engineering for ensuring the efficiency,
reliability, and robustness of software systems. However, it is well-known that
the problem of determining the worst-case time complexity of a given code
written in general-purpose programming language is theoretically undecidable by
the famous Halting problem proven by Alan Turing. Thus, we move towards more
realistic scenarios where the inputs and outputs of a program exist. This
allows us to discern the correctness of given codes, challenging to analyze
their time complexity exhaustively. In response to this challenge, we introduce
CodeComplex, a novel source code dataset where each code is manually annotated
with a corresponding worst-case time complexity. CodeComplex comprises 4,900
Java codes and an equivalent number of Python codes, all sourced from
programming competitions and annotated with complexity labels by a panel of
algorithmic experts. To the best of our knowledge, CodeComplex stands as the
most extensive code dataset tailored for predicting complexity. Subsequently,
we present the outcomes of our experiments employing various baseline models,
leveraging state-of-the-art neural models in code comprehension like CodeBERT,
GraphCodeBERT, UniXcoder, PLBART, CodeT5, CodeT5+, and ChatGPT. We analyze how
the dataset impacts the model's learning in predicting time complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Crops for food, feed, fiber, and fuel are key natural resources for our
society. Monitoring plants and measuring their traits is an important task in
agriculture often referred to as plant phenotyping. Traditionally, this task is
done manually, which is time- and labor-intensive. Robots can automate
phenotyping providing reproducible and high-frequency measurements. Today's
perception systems use deep learning to interpret these measurements, but
require a substantial amount of annotated data to work well. Obtaining such
labels is challenging as it often requires background knowledge on the side of
the labelers. This paper addresses the problem of reducing the labeling effort
required to perform leaf instance segmentation on 3D point clouds, which is a
first step toward phenotyping in 3D. Separating all leaves allows us to count
them and compute relevant traits as their areas, lengths, and widths. We
propose a novel self-supervised task-specific pre-training approach to
initialize the backbone of a network for leaf instance segmentation. We also
introduce a novel automatic postprocessing that considers the difficulty of
correctly segmenting the points close to the stem, where all the leaves petiole
overlap. The experiments presented in this paper suggest that our approach
boosts the performance over all the investigated scenarios. We also evaluate
the embeddings to assess the quality of the fully unsupervised approach and see
a higher performance of our domain-specific postprocessing.

can help save healthcare costs while also improving the quality of life of the
users that need rehabilitation. The main contribution of this paper is to
present, as a whole, all the features supported by the innovative Kinect-based
Telerehabilitation System (KiReS). In addition to the functionalities provided
by current systems, it handles two new ones that could be incorporated into
them, in order to give a step forward towards a new generation of
telerehabilitation systems. The knowledge extraction functionality handles
knowledge about the physical therapy record of patients and treatment protocols
described in an ontology, named TRHONT, to select the adequate exercises for
the rehabilitation of patients. The teleimmersion functionality provides a
convenient, effective and user-friendly experience when performing the
telerehabilitation, through a two-way real-time multimedia communication. The
ontology contains about 2300 classes and 100 properties, and the system allows
a reliable transmission of Kinect video depth, audio and skeleton data, being
able to adapt to various network conditions. Moreover, the system has been
tested with patients who suffered from shoulder disorders or total hip

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning is a promising approach for learning from user data while
preserving data privacy. However, the high requirements of the model training
process make it difficult for clients with limited memory or bandwidth to
participate. To tackle this problem, Split Federated Learning is utilized,
where clients upload their intermediate model training outcomes to a cloud
server for collaborative server-client model training. This methodology
facilitates resource-constrained clients' participation in model training but
also increases the training time and communication overhead. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel algorithm, called Hierarchical Split Federated
Learning (HierSFL), that amalgamates models at the edge and cloud phases,
presenting qualitative directives for determining the best aggregation
timeframes to reduce computation and communication expenses. By implementing
local differential privacy at the client and edge server levels, we enhance
privacy during local model parameter updates. Our experiments using CIFAR-10
and MNIST datasets show that HierSFL outperforms standard FL approaches with
better training accuracy, training time, and communication-computing
trade-offs. HierSFL offers a promising solution to mobile edge computing's
challenges, ultimately leading to faster content delivery and improved mobile
service quality.

<p class="mathjax">Recent developments in text-to-image models, particularly Stable Diffusion,
have marked significant achievements in various applications. With these
advancements, there are growing safety concerns about the vulnerability of the
model that malicious entities exploit to generate targeted harmful images.
However, the existing methods in the vulnerability of the model mainly evaluate
the alignment between the prompt and generated images, but fall short in
revealing the vulnerability associated with targeted image generation. In this
study, we formulate the problem of targeted adversarial attack on Stable
Diffusion and propose a framework to generate adversarial prompts.
Specifically, we design a gradient-based embedding optimization method to craft
reliable adversarial prompts that guide stable diffusion to generate specific
images. Furthermore, after obtaining successful adversarial prompts, we reveal
the mechanisms that cause the vulnerability of the model. Extensive experiments
on two targeted attack tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
targeted attacks. The code can be obtained in

<p class="mathjax">The problem of traffic congestion not only causes a large amount of economic
losses, but also seriously endangers the urban environment. Predicting traffic
congestion has important practical significance. So far, most studies have been
based on historical data from sensors placed on different roads to predict
future traffic flow and speed, to analyze the traffic congestion conditions of
a certain road segment. However, due to the fixed position of sensors, it is
difficult to mine new information. On the other hand, vehicle trajectory data
is more flexible and can extract traffic information as needed. Therefore, we
proposed a new traffic congestion prediction model - Multi Adjacency
relationship Attention Graph Convolutional Networks(MA2GCN). This model
transformed vehicle trajectory data into graph structured data in grid form,
and proposed a vehicle entry and exit matrix based on the mobility between
different grids. At the same time, in order to improve the performance of the
model, this paper also built a new adaptive adjacency matrix generation method
and adjacency matrix attention module. This model mainly used gated temporal
convolution and graph convolution to extract temporal and spatial information,
respectively. Compared with multiple baselines, our model achieved the best
performance on Shanghai taxi GPS trajectory dataset. The code is available at
https://github.com/zachysun/Taxi Traffic Benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is widely employed
to stabilize partially observable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by
utilizing a centralized value function during training. However, existing
methods typically assume that agents make decisions based on their local
observations independently, which may not lead to a correlated joint policy
with sufficient coordination. Inspired by the concept of correlated
equilibrium, we propose to introduce a \textit{strategy modification} to
provide a mechanism for agents to correlate their policies. Specifically, we
present a novel framework, AgentMixer, which constructs the joint fully
observable policy as a non-linear combination of individual partially
observable policies. To enable decentralized execution, one can derive
individual policies by imitating the joint policy. Unfortunately, such
imitation learning can lead to \textit{asymmetric learning failure} caused by
the mismatch between joint policy and individual policy information. To
mitigate this issue, we jointly train the joint policy and individual policies
and introduce \textit{Individual-Global-Consistency} to guarantee mode
consistency between the centralized and decentralized policies. We then
theoretically prove that AgentMixer converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate
Correlated Equilibrium. The strong experimental performance on three MARL
benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">It is believed that in knowledge distillation (KD), the role of the teacher
is to provide an estimate for the unknown Bayes conditional probability
distribution (BCPD) to be used in the student training process. Conventionally,
this estimate is obtained by training the teacher using maximum log-likelihood
(MLL) method. To improve this estimate for KD, in this paper we introduce the
concept of conditional mutual information (CMI) into the estimation of BCPD and
propose a novel estimator called the maximum CMI (MCMI) method. Specifically,
in MCMI estimation, both the log-likelihood and CMI of the teacher are
simultaneously maximized when the teacher is trained. Through Eigen-CAM, it is
further shown that maximizing the teacher's CMI value allows the teacher to
capture more contextual information in an image cluster. Via conducting a
thorough set of experiments, we show that by employing a teacher trained via
MCMI estimation rather than one trained via MLL estimation in various
state-of-the-art KD frameworks, the student's classification accuracy
consistently increases, with the gain of up to 3.32\%. This suggests that the
teacher's BCPD estimate provided by MCMI method is more accurate than that
provided by MLL method. In addition, we show that such improvements in the
student's accuracy are more drastic in zero-shot and few-shot settings.
Notably, the student's accuracy increases with the gain of up to 5.72\% when
5\% of the training samples are available to the student (few-shot), and
increases from 0\% to as high as 84\% for an omitted class (zero-shot). The

<p class="mathjax">Public opinion on international conflicts, such as the concurrent
Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine crises, often reflects a society's values,
beliefs, and history. These simultaneous conflicts have sparked heated global
online discussions, offering a unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of
public opinion in multiple international crises. This study investigates how
public opinions toward one conflict might influence or relate to another, a
relatively unexplored area in contemporary research. Focusing on Chinese
netizens, who represent a significant online population, this study examines
their perspectives, which are increasingly influential in global discourse due
to China's unique cultural and political landscape. The research finds a range
of opinions, including neutral stances towards both conflicts and a statistical
correlation between attitudes towards each, indicating interconnected or
mutually influenced viewpoints. The study also highlights the significant role
of news media, particularly in China, where state policies and global politics
shape conflict portrayal, in impacting public opinion.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are widely known to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples. However, vanilla adversarial examples generated under the white-box
setting often exhibit low transferability across different models. Since
adversarial transferability poses more severe threats to practical
applications, various approaches have been proposed for better transferability,
including gradient-based, input transformation-based, and model-related
attacks, \etc. In this work, we find that several tiny changes in the existing
adversarial attacks can significantly affect the attack performance, \eg, the
number of iterations and step size. Based on careful studies of existing
adversarial attacks, we propose a bag of tricks to enhance adversarial
transferability, including momentum initialization, scheduled step size, dual
example, spectral-based input transformation, and several ensemble strategies.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset validate the high effectiveness
of our proposed tricks and show that combining them can further boost
adversarial transferability. Our work provides practical insights and
techniques to enhance adversarial transferability, and offers guidance to
improve the attack performance on the real-world application through simple
adjustments.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the world in first-person view is fundamental in Augmented
Reality (AR). This immersive perspective brings dramatic visual changes and
unique challenges compared to third-person views. Synthetic data has empowered
third-person-view vision models, but its application to embodied egocentric
perception tasks remains largely unexplored. A critical challenge lies in
simulating natural human movements and behaviors that effectively steer the
embodied cameras to capture a faithful egocentric representation of the 3D
world. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoGen, a new synthetic data
generator that can produce accurate and rich ground-truth training data for
egocentric perception tasks. At the heart of EgoGen is a novel human motion
synthesis model that directly leverages egocentric visual inputs of a virtual
human to sense the 3D environment. Combined with collision-avoiding motion
primitives and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach, our motion
synthesis model offers a closed-loop solution where the embodied perception and
movement of the virtual human are seamlessly coupled. Compared to previous
works, our model eliminates the need for a pre-defined global path, and is
directly applicable to dynamic environments. Combined with our easy-to-use and
scalable data generation pipeline, we demonstrate EgoGen's efficacy in three
tasks: mapping and localization for head-mounted cameras, egocentric camera
tracking, and human mesh recovery from egocentric views. EgoGen will be fully
open-sourced, offering a practical solution for creating realistic egocentric
training data and aiming to serve as a useful tool for egocentric computer
vision research. Refer to our project page: https://ego-gen.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">We present Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative
models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). The interpolant
framework, which allows for connecting two distributions in a more flexible way
than standard diffusion models, makes possible a modular study of various
design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport: using
discrete vs. continuous time learning, deciding the objective for the model to
learn, choosing the interpolant connecting the distributions, and deploying a
deterministic or stochastic sampler. By carefully introducing the above
ingredients, SiT surpasses DiT uniformly across model sizes on the conditional
ImageNet 256x256 benchmark using the exact same backbone, number of parameters,
and GFLOPs. By exploring various diffusion coefficients, which can be tuned
separately from learning, SiT achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the Fixed Point Diffusion Model (FPDM), a novel approach to
image generation that integrates the concept of fixed point solving into the
framework of diffusion-based generative modeling. Our approach embeds an
implicit fixed point solving layer into the denoising network of a diffusion
model, transforming the diffusion process into a sequence of closely-related
fixed point problems. Combined with a new stochastic training method, this
approach significantly reduces model size, reduces memory usage, and
accelerates training. Moreover, it enables the development of two new
techniques to improve sampling efficiency: reallocating computation across
timesteps and reusing fixed point solutions between timesteps. We conduct
extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models on ImageNet, FFHQ,
CelebA-HQ, and LSUN-Church, demonstrating substantial improvements in
performance and efficiency. Compared to the state-of-the-art DiT model, FPDM
contains 87% fewer parameters, consumes 60% less memory during training, and
improves image generation quality in situations where sampling computation or
time is limited. Our code and pretrained models are available at
https://lukemelas.github.io/fixed-point-diffusion-models.

<p class="mathjax">Generating dynamic three-dimensional (3D) object from a single-view video is
challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. Existing methods extend
text-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such
as score distillation sampling, but they are slow and expensive to scale (e.g.,
150 minutes per object) due to the need for back-propagating the
information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation
framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent
images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to
directly train a novel 4D Gaussian splatting model with explicit point cloud
geometry, enabling real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers
a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives
while preserving the same level of innovative view synthesis quality. For
example, Efficient4D takes only 14 minutes to model a dynamic object.

<p class="mathjax">Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's minds, is an
essential ingredient for developing machines with human-level social
intelligence. Recent machine learning models, particularly large language
models, seem to show some aspects of ToM understanding. However, existing ToM
benchmarks use unimodal datasets - either video or text. Human ToM, on the
other hand, is more than video or text understanding. People can flexibly
reason about another person's mind based on conceptual representations (e.g.,
goals, beliefs, plans) extracted from any available data, which can include
visual cues, linguistic narratives, or both. To address this, we introduce a
multimodal Theory of Mind question answering (MMToM-QA) benchmark. MMToM-QA
comprehensively evaluates machine ToM both on multimodal data and on different
kinds of unimodal data about a person's activity in a household environment. To
engineer multimodal ToM capacity, we propose a novel method, BIP-ALM (Bayesian
Inverse Planning Accelerated by Language Models). BIP-ALM extracts unified
representations from multimodal data and utilizes language models for scalable
Bayesian inverse planning. We conducted a systematic comparison of human
performance, BIP-ALM, and state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4. The
experiments demonstrate that large language models and large multimodal models
still lack robust ToM capacity. BIP-ALM, on the other hand, shows promising
results, by leveraging the power of both model-based mental inference and
language models.

<p class="mathjax">This paper assesses trending AI foundation models, especially emerging
computer vision foundation models and their performance in natural landscape
feature segmentation. While the term foundation model has quickly garnered
interest from the geospatial domain, its definition remains vague. Hence, this
paper will first introduce AI foundation models and their defining
characteristics. Built upon the tremendous success achieved by Large Language
Models (LLMs) as the foundation models for language tasks, this paper discusses
the challenges of building foundation models for geospatial artificial
intelligence (GeoAI) vision tasks. To evaluate the performance of large AI
vision models, especially Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), we implemented
different instance segmentation pipelines that minimize the changes to SAM to
leverage its power as a foundation model. A series of prompt strategies was
developed to test SAM's performance regarding its theoretical upper bound of
predictive accuracy, zero-shot performance, and domain adaptability through
fine-tuning. The analysis used two permafrost feature datasets, ice-wedge
polygons and retrogressive thaw slumps because (1) these landform features are
more challenging to segment than manmade features due to their complicated
formation mechanisms, diverse forms, and vague boundaries; (2) their presence
and changes are important indicators for Arctic warming and climate change. The
results show that although promising, SAM still has room for improvement to
support AI-augmented terrain mapping. The spatial and domain generalizability
of this finding is further validated using a more general dataset EuroCrop for
agricultural field mapping. Finally, we discuss future research directions that
strengthen SAM's applicability in challenging geospatial domains.

<p class="mathjax">Predictive risk models in the public sector are commonly developed using
administrative data that is more complete for subpopulations that more greatly
rely on public services. In the United States, for instance, information on
health care utilization is routinely available to government agencies for
individuals supported by Medicaid and Medicare, but not for the privately
insured. Critiques of public sector algorithms have identified such
differential feature under-reporting as a driver of disparities in algorithmic
decision-making. Yet this form of data bias remains understudied from a
technical viewpoint. While prior work has examined the fairness impacts of
additive feature noise and features that are clearly marked as missing, the
setting of data missingness absent indicators (i.e. differential feature
under-reporting) has been lacking in research attention. In this work, we
present an analytically tractable model of differential feature under-reporting
which we then use to characterize the impact of this kind of data bias on
algorithmic fairness. We demonstrate how standard missing data methods
typically fail to mitigate bias in this setting, and propose a new set of
methods specifically tailored to differential feature under-reporting. Our
results show that, in real world data settings, under-reporting typically leads
to increasing disparities. The proposed solution methods show success in
mitigating increases in unfairness.

<p class="mathjax">The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered profound societal changes, extending
beyond its health impacts to the moralization of behaviors. Leveraging insights
from moral psychology, this study delves into the moral fabric shaping online
discussions surrounding COVID-19 over a span of nearly two years. Our
investigation identifies four distinct user groups characterized by differences
in morality, political ideology, and communication styles. We underscore the
intricate relationship between moral differences and political ideologies,
revealing a nuanced picture where moral orientations do not rigidly separate
users politically. Furthermore, we uncover patterns of moral homophily within
the social network, highlighting the existence of one potential moral echo
chamber. Analyzing the moral themes embedded in messages, we observe that
messages featuring moral foundations not typically favored by their authors, as
well as those incorporating multiple moral foundations, resonate more
effectively with out-group members. This research contributes valuable insights
into the complex interplay between moral foundations, communication dynamics,
and network structures on Twitter.

<p class="mathjax">Research data and software are widely accepted as an outcome of scientific
work. However, in comparison to text-based publications, there is not yet an
established process to assess and evaluate quality of research data and
research software publications. This paper presents an attempt to fill this
gap. Initiated by the Working Group Open Science of the Helmholtz Association
the Task Group Helmholtz Quality Indicators for Data and Software Publications
currently develops a quality indicator for research data and research software
publications to be used within the Association. This report summarizes the
vision of the group of what all contributes to such an indicator. The proposed
approach relies on generic well-established concepts for quality criteria, such
as the FAIR Principles and the COBIT Maturity Model. It does - on purpose - not
limit itself to technical implementation possibilities to avoid using an
existing metric for a new purpose. The intention of this paper is to share the
current state for further discussion with all stakeholders, particularly with
other groups also working on similar metrics but also with entities that use
the metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Batteryless energy harvesting systems enable a wide array of new sensing,
computation, and communication platforms untethered by power delivery or
battery maintenance demands. Energy harvesters charge a buffer capacitor from
an unreliable environmental source until enough energy is stored to guarantee a
burst of operation despite changes in power input. Current platforms use a
fixed-size buffer chosen at design time to meet constraints on charge time or
application longevity, but static energy buffers are a poor fit for the highly
volatile power sources found in real-world deployments: fixed buffers waste
energy both as heat when they reach capacity during a power surplus and as
leakage when they fail to charge the system during a power deficit.
<br />To maximize batteryless system performance in the face of highly dynamic
input power, we propose REACT: a responsive buffering circuit which varies
total capacitance according to net input power. REACT uses a variable capacitor
bank to expand capacitance to capture incoming energy during a power surplus
and reconfigures internal capacitors to reclaim additional energy from each
capacitor as power input falls. Compared to fixed-capacity systems, REACT
captures more energy, maximizes usable energy, and efficiently decouples system
voltage from stored charge -- enabling low-power and high-performance designs
previously limited by ambient power. Our evaluation on real-world platforms
shows that REACT eliminates the tradeoff between responsiveness, efficiency,
and longevity, increasing the energy available for useful work by an average
25.6% over static buffers optimized for reactivity and capacity, improving
event responsiveness by an average 7.7x without sacrificing capacity, and
enabling programmer directed longevity guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">In software development, formal program specifications play a crucial role in
various stages. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is
rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover,
it is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and
comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs. To reduce the
burden on software developers, automated specification generation methods have
emerged. However, existing methods usually rely on predefined templates or
grammar, making them struggle to accurately describe the behavior and
functionality of complex real-world programs. To tackle this challenge, we
introduce SpecGen, a novel technique for formal program specification
generation based on Large Language Models. Our key insight is to overcome the
limitations of existing methods by leveraging the code comprehension capability
of LLMs. The process of SpecGen consists of two phases. The first phase employs
a conversational approach that guides the LLM to generate appropriate
specifications for a given program. The second phase, designed for where the
LLM fails to generate correct specifications, applies four mutation operators
to the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications
from the mutated ones through a novel heuristic selection strategy by assigning
different weights of variants in an efficient manner. To evaluate the
performance of SpecGen, we manually construct a dataset containing 120 test
cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen succeeds in generating
verifiable specifications for 100 out of 120 programs, outperforming the
existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation
tools. Further investigations on the quality of generated specifications
indicate that SpecGen can comprehensively articulate the behaviors of the input
program.

<p class="mathjax">Although much research has been done on proposing new models or loss
functions to improve the generalisation of artificial neural networks (ANNs),
less attention has been directed to the impact of the training data on
generalisation. In this work, we start from approximating the interaction
between samples, i.e. how learning one sample would modify the model's
prediction on other samples. Through analysing the terms involved in weight
updates in supervised learning, we find that labels influence the interaction
between samples. Therefore, we propose the labelled pseudo Neural Tangent
Kernel (lpNTK) which takes label information into consideration when measuring
the interactions between samples. We first prove that lpNTK asymptotically
converges to the empirical neural tangent kernel in terms of the Frobenius norm
under certain assumptions. Secondly, we illustrate how lpNTK helps to
understand learning phenomena identified in previous work, specifically the
learning difficulty of samples and forgetting events during learning. Moreover,
we also show that using lpNTK to identify and remove poisoning training samples
does not hurt the generalisation performance of ANNs.

<p class="mathjax">3D Reconstruction of moving articulated objects without additional
information about object structure is a challenging problem. Current methods
overcome such challenges by employing category-specific skeletal models.
Consequently, they do not generalize well to articulated objects in the wild.
We treat an articulated object as an unknown, semi-rigid skeletal structure
surrounded by nonrigid material (e.g., skin). Our method simultaneously
estimates the visible (explicit) representation (3D shapes, colors, camera
parameters) and the implicit skeletal representation, from motion cues in the
object video without 3D supervision. Our implicit representation consists of
four parts. (1) Skeleton, which specifies how semi-rigid parts are connected.
(2) \textcolor{black}{Skinning Weights}, which associates each surface vertex
with semi-rigid parts with probability. (3) Rigidity Coefficients, specifying
the articulation of the local surface. (4) Time-Varying Transformations, which
specify the skeletal motion and surface deformation parameters. We introduce an
algorithm that uses physical constraints as regularization terms and
iteratively estimates both implicit and explicit representations. Our method is
category-agnostic, thus eliminating the need for category-specific skeletons,
we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art across standard video
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the recent advances in large-scale diffusion models, little progress
has been made on the layout-to-image (L2I) synthesis task. Current L2I models
either suffer from poor editability via text or weak alignment between the
generated image and the input layout. This limits their usability in practice.
To mitigate this, we propose to integrate adversarial supervision into the
conventional training pipeline of L2I diffusion models (ALDM). Specifically, we
employ a segmentation-based discriminator which provides explicit feedback to
the diffusion generator on the pixel-level alignment between the denoised image
and the input layout. To encourage consistent adherence to the input layout
over the sampling steps, we further introduce the multistep unrolling strategy.
Instead of looking at a single timestep, we unroll a few steps recursively to
imitate the inference process, and ask the discriminator to assess the
alignment of denoised images with the layout over a certain time window. Our
experiments show that ALDM enables layout faithfulness of the generated images,
while allowing broad editability via text prompts. Moreover, we showcase its
usefulness for practical applications: by synthesizing target distribution
samples via text control, we improve domain generalization of semantic
segmentation models by a large margin (~12 mIoU points).

<p class="mathjax">We explore the social and contextual factors that influence the outcome of
person-to-person music recommendations and discovery. Specifically, we use data
from Spotify to investigate how a link sent from one user to another results in
the receiver engaging with the music of the shared artist. We consider several
factors that may influence this process, such as the strength of the
sender-receiver relationship, the user's role in the Spotify social network,
their music social cohesion, and how similar the new artist is to the
receiver's taste. We find that the receiver of a link is more likely to engage
with a new artist when (1) they have similar music taste to the sender and the
shared track is a good fit for their taste, (2) they have a stronger and more
intimate tie with the sender, and (3) the shared artist is popular with the
receiver's connections. Finally, we use these findings to build a Random Forest
classifier to predict whether a shared music track will result in the
receiver's engagement with the shared artist. This model elucidates which type
of social and contextual features are most predictive, although peak
performance is achieved when a diverse set of features are included. These
findings provide new insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the
interplay between music discovery and social processes.

<p class="mathjax">Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising direction for learning
policies from pre-collected datasets without requiring further interactions
with the environment. However, existing methods struggle to handle
out-of-distribution (OOD) extrapolation errors, especially in sparse reward or
scarce data settings. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm
called Conservative Density Estimation (CDE), which addresses this challenge by
explicitly imposing constraints on the state-action occupancy stationary
distribution. CDE overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, such as the
stationary distribution correction method, by addressing the support mismatch
issue in marginal importance sampling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the D4RL benchmark. Notably, CDE consistently outperforms
baselines in challenging tasks with sparse rewards or insufficient data,
demonstrating the advantages of our approach in addressing the extrapolation
error problem in offline RL.

<p class="mathjax">Counterfactuals -- expressing what might have been true under different
circumstances -- have been widely applied in statistics and machine learning to
help understand causal relationships. More recently, counterfactuals have begun
to emerge as a technique being applied within visualization research. However,
it remains unclear to what extent counterfactuals can aid with visual data
communication. In this paper, we primarily focus on assessing the quality of
users' understanding of data when provided with counterfactual visualizations.
We propose a preliminary model of causality comprehension by connecting
theories from causal inference and visual data communication. Leveraging this
model, we conducted an empirical study to explore how counterfactuals can
improve users' understanding of data in static visualizations. Our results
indicate that visualizing counterfactuals had a positive impact on
participants' interpretations of causal relations within datasets. These
results motivate a discussion of how to more effectively incorporate
counterfactuals into data visualizations.

<p class="mathjax">Online reviews in the form of user-generated content (UGC) significantly
impact consumer decision-making. However, the pervasive issue of not only human
fake content but also machine-generated content challenges UGC's reliability.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) may pave the way to fabricate
indistinguishable fake generated content at a much lower cost. Leveraging
OpenAI's GPT-4-Turbo and DALL-E-2 models, we craft AiGen-FoodReview, a
multi-modal dataset of 20,144 restaurant review-image pairs divided into
authentic and machine-generated. We explore unimodal and multimodal detection
models, achieving 99.80% multimodal accuracy with FLAVA. We use attributes from
readability and photographic theories to score reviews and images,
respectively, demonstrating their utility as hand-crafted features in scalable
and interpretable detection models, with comparable performance. The paper
contributes by open-sourcing the dataset and releasing fake review detectors,
recommending its use in unimodal and multimodal fake review detection tasks,
and evaluating linguistic and visual features in synthetic versus authentic
data.

<p class="mathjax">Pruning methods have recently grown in popularity as an effective way to
reduce the size and computational complexity of deep neural networks. Large
numbers of parameters can be removed from trained models with little
discernible loss in accuracy after a small number of continued training epochs.
However, pruning too many parameters at once often causes an initial steep drop
in accuracy which can undermine convergence quality. Iterative pruning
approaches mitigate this by gradually removing a small number of parameters
over multiple epochs. However, this can still lead to subnetworks that overfit
local regions of the loss landscape. We introduce a novel and effective
approach to tuning subnetworks through a regularization technique we call
Stochastic Subnetwork Annealing. Instead of removing parameters in a discrete
manner, we instead represent subnetworks with stochastic masks where each
parameter has a probabilistic chance of being included or excluded on any given
forward pass. We anneal these probabilities over time such that subnetwork
structure slowly evolves as mask values become more deterministic, allowing for
a smoother and more robust optimization of subnetworks at high levels of
sparsity.

<p class="mathjax">The engagement with online health misinformation, particularly during
COVID-19, poses unprecedented threats to societal well-being. The
susceptibility to misinformation is heightened within a multi-topic context
during health crises. This paper addresses a critical gap in understanding
online engagement with multi-topic misinformation related to COVID-19. We
conduct a comprehensive analysis of 7273 fact-checked source news claims
related to COVID-19 and their corresponding social engagement on X/Twitter
through the lens of topic diversity and conspiracy theories. Our analysis
yields several key findings: (i) False news, especially when accompanied by
conspiracy theories, exhibits higher topic diversity compared to true news.
(ii) In terms of engagement from source claims to online posts, false news has
a longer lifetime and receives more posts on X/Twitter compared to true news.
Additionally, the integration of conspiracy theories is associated with a
longer lifetime of COVID-19 misinformation. (iii) News posts characterized by
heightened topic diversity receive increased social engagement on X/Twitter in
terms of reposts, likes, and replies. However, the effect of topic diversity is
moderated by the news veracity. High topic diversity is linked to more
engagement with true news posts compared to false news posts. (iiii) The
integration of conspiracy theories is linked to more social engagement with
misinformation on X/Twitter. False news posts that contain conspiracy theories,
on average, receive 40.8% more reposts, 45.2% more likes, and 44.1% more
replies compared to false news posts without conspiracy theories. These
findings offer insights into understanding the engagement with multi-topic
misinformation during health crises and highlight the importance of considering
topic diversity and conspiracy theories in developing targeted interventions.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a Guided Attention (GA) auxiliary training loss,
which improves the effectiveness and robustness of automatic speech recognition
(ASR) contextual biasing without introducing additional parameters. A common
challenge in previous literature is that the word error rate (WER) reduction
brought by contextual biasing diminishes as the number of bias phrases
increases. To address this challenge, we employ a GA loss as an additional
training objective besides the Transducer loss. The proposed GA loss aims to
teach the cross attention how to align bias phrases with text tokens or audio
frames. Compared to studies with similar motivations, the proposed loss
operates directly on the cross attention weights and is easier to implement.
Through extensive experiments based on Conformer Transducer with Contextual
Adapter, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only leads to a lower WER
but also retains its effectiveness as the number of bias phrases increases.
Specifically, the GA loss decreases the WER of rare vocabularies by up to 19.2%
on LibriSpeech compared to the contextual biasing baseline, and up to 49.3%
compared to a vanilla Transducer.

<p class="mathjax">Image fusion in Remote Sensing (RS) has been a consistent demand due to its
ability to turn raw images of different resolutions, sources, and modalities
into accurate, complete, and spatio-temporally coherent images. It greatly
facilitates downstream applications such as pan-sharpening, change detection,
land-cover classification, etc. Yet, image fusion solutions are highly
disparate to various remote sensing problems and thus are often narrowly
defined in existing reviews as topical applications, such as pan-sharpening,
and spatial-temporal image fusion. Considering that image fusion can be
theoretically applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations, in
this paper, we expanded its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works
with a simple taxonomy: 1) many-to-one image fusion; 2) many-to-many image
fusion. This simple taxonomy defines image fusion as a mapping problem that
turns either a single or a set of images into another single or set of images,
depending on the desired coherence, e.g., spectral, spatial/resolution
coherence, etc. We show that this simple taxonomy, despite the significant
modality difference it covers, can be presented by a conceptually easy
framework. In addition, we provide a meta-analysis to review the major papers
studying the various types of image fusion and their applications over the
years (from the 1980s to date), covering 5,926 peer-reviewed papers. Finally,
we discuss the main benefits and emerging challenges to provide open research
directions and potential future works.

representation of volumetric data utilizing coordinate-based networks and
multi-resolution hash encoding. Efficient compression of volumetric data is
crucial for various applications, such as medical imaging and scientific
simulations. Our approach enables effective compression by learning a mapping
between spatial coordinates and intensity values. We compare different encoding
schemes and demonstrate the superiority of multi-resolution hash encoding in
terms of compression quality and training efficiency. Furthermore, we leverage
optimization-based meta-learning, specifically using the Reptile algorithm, to
learn weight initialization for neural representations tailored to volumetric
data, enabling faster convergence during optimization. Additionally, we compare
our approach with state-of-the-art methods to showcase improved image quality
and compression ratios. These findings highlight the potential of
coordinate-based networks and multi-resolution hash encoding for an efficient

in large-scale data visualization and other applications.

<p class="mathjax">The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is probably the most disruptive global
health disaster in recent history. It negatively impacted the whole world and
virtually brought the global economy to a standstill. However, as the virus was
spreading, infecting people and claiming thousands of lives so was the spread
and propagation of fake news, misinformation and disinformation about the
event. These included the spread of unconfirmed health advice and remedies on
social media. In this paper, false information about the pandemic is identified
using a content-based approach and metadata curated from messages posted to
online social networks. A content-based approach combined with metadata as well
as an initial feature analysis is used and then several supervised learning
models are tested for identifying and predicting misleading posts. Our approach
shows up to 93% accuracy in the detection of fake news related posts about the
COVID-19 pandemic

with hybrid state spaces. The framework uses transition systems to
mathematically represent planning tasks and employs multiple solvers to
iteratively improve the plan until computation resources are exhausted. When
integrating different solvers for iterative planning, we establish theoretical
guarantees on the mathematical framework to ensure recursive feasibility. The
proposed framework enables continual improvement of solution optimality,
efficiently using allocated computation resources. The proposed method is
validated by applying it to an energy-aware UGV-UAV cooperative task site
assignment. The results demonstrate the continual solution improvement while
preserving real-time implementation ability compared to algorithms proposed in

<p class="mathjax">Discrete-action reinforcement learning algorithms often falter in tasks with
high-dimensional discrete action spaces due to the vast number of possible
actions. A recent advancement leverages value-decomposition, a concept from
multi-agent reinforcement learning, to tackle this challenge. This study delves
deep into the effects of this value-decomposition, revealing that whilst it
curtails the over-estimation bias inherent to Q-learning algorithms, it
amplifies target variance. To counteract this, we present an ensemble of
critics to mitigate target variance. Moreover, we introduce a regularisation
loss that helps to mitigate the effects that exploratory actions in one
dimension can have on the value of optimal actions in other dimensions. Our
novel algorithm, REValueD, tested on discretised versions of the DeepMind
Control Suite tasks, showcases superior performance, especially in the
challenging humanoid and dog tasks. We further dissect the factors influencing
REValueD's performance, evaluating the significance of the regularisation loss
and the scalability of REValueD with increasing sub-actions per dimension.

<p class="mathjax">Cognitive load classification is the task of automatically determining an
individual's utilization of working memory resources during performance of a
task based on physiologic measures such as electroencephalography (EEG). In
this paper, we follow a cross-disciplinary approach, where tools and
methodologies from speech processing are used to tackle this problem. The
corpus we use was released publicly in 2021 as part of the first passive
brain-computer interface competition on cross-session workload estimation. We
present our approach which used i-vector-based neural network classifiers to
accomplish inter-subject cross-session EEG transfer learning, achieving 18%
relative improvement over equivalent subject-dependent models. We also report
experiments showing how our subject-independent models perform competitively on
held-out subjects and improve with additional subject data, suggesting that
subject-dependent training is not required for effective cognitive load
determination.

<p class="mathjax">File systems must allocate space for files without knowing what will be added
or removed in the future. Over the life of a file system, this may cause
suboptimal file placement decisions that eventually lead to slower performance,
or aging. Conventional wisdom suggests that file system aging is a solved
problem in the common case; heuristics to avoid aging, such as colocating
related files and data blocks, are effective until a storage device fills up,
at which point space pressure exacerbates fragmentation-based aging. However,
this article describes both realistic and synthetic workloads that can cause
these heuristics to fail, inducing large performance declines due to aging,
even when the storage device is nearly empty.
<br />We argue that these slowdowns are caused by poor layout. We demonstrate a
correlation between the read performance of a directory scan and the locality
within a file system's access patterns, using a dynamic layout score. We
complement these results with microbenchmarks that show that space pressure can
cause a substantial amount of inter-file and intra-file fragmentation. However,
our results suggest that the effect of free-space fragmentation on read
performance is best described as accelerating the file system aging process.
The effect on write performance is non-existent in some cases, and, in most
cases, an order of magnitude smaller than the read degradation from
fragmentation caused by normal usage.
<br />In short, many file systems are exquisitely prone to read aging after a
variety of write patterns. We show, however, that aging is not inevitable.
BetrFS, a file system based on write-optimized dictionaries, exhibits almost no
aging in our experiments. We present a framework for understanding and
predicting aging, and identify the key features of BetrFS that avoid aging.

<p class="mathjax">Serverless computing relieves developers from the burden of resource
management, thus providing ease-of-use to the users and the opportunity to
optimize resource utilization for the providers. However, today's serverless
systems lack performance guarantees for function invocations, thus limiting
support for performance-critical applications: we observed severe performance
variability (up to 6x). Providers lack visibility into user functions and hence
find it challenging to right-size them: we observed heavy resource
underutilization (up to 80%). To understand the causes behind the performance
variability and underutilization, we conducted a measurement study of commonly
deployed serverless functions and learned that the function performance and
resource utilization depend crucially on function semantics and inputs. Our key
insight is to delay making resource allocation decisions until after the
function inputs are available. We introduce Shabari, a resource management
framework for serverless systems that makes decisions as late as possible to
right-size each invocation to meet functions' performance objectives (SLOs) and
improve resource utilization. Shabari uses an online learning agent to
right-size each function invocation based on the features of the function input
and makes cold-start-aware scheduling decisions. For a range of serverless
functions and inputs, Shabari reduces SLO violations by 11-73% while not
wasting any vCPUs and reducing wasted memory by 64-94% in the median case,
compared to state-of-the-art systems, including Aquatope, Parrotfish, and
Cypress.

<p class="mathjax">High-quality annotation of fine-grained visual categories demands great
expert knowledge, which is taxing and time consuming. Alternatively, learning
fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g.,
species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution.
However, recent researches find that existing self-supervised learning methods
are less qualified to represent fine-grained categories. The bottleneck lies in
that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding,
while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an
image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation
(CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the
importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text
representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the
relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the
multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image
crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside
the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance
distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation. Extensive experiments
on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft show that the proposed method
outperforms the contemporary method by upto 10.14% and existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches by upto 19.78% on both
top-1 accuracy and Rank-1 retrieval metric.

<p class="mathjax">The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technology has emerged as a promising
solution for network operators, providing them with an open and favorable
environment. Ensuring effective coordination of x-applications (xAPPs) is
crucial to enhance flexibility and optimize network performance within the
O-RAN. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach to the resource
allocation problem, aiming to coordinate multiple independent xAPPs for network
slicing and resource allocation in O-RAN. Our proposed method focuses on
maximizing the weighted throughput among user equipments (UE), as well as
allocating physical resource blocks (PRBs). We prioritize two service types,
namely enhanced Mobile Broadband and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication.
To achieve this, we have designed two xAPPs: a power control xAPP for each UE
and a PRB allocation xAPP. The proposed method consists of a two-part training
phase, where the first part uses supervised learning with a Variational
Autoencoder trained to regress the power transmission as well as the user
association and PRB allocation decisions, and the second part uses unsupervised
learning with a contrastive loss approach to improve the generalization and
robustness of the model. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method by
comparing its results to those obtained from an exhaustive search algorithm,
deep Q-network algorithm, and by reporting performance metrics for the
regression task. We also evaluate the proposed model's performance in different
scenarios among the service types. The results show that the proposed method is
a more efficient and effective solution for network slicing problems compared
to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from
different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer
vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized
domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization
error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension
($d_{data}$) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship
varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging
domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in
knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling
law with respect to $d_{data}$, and propose that the substantial scaling
discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially
attributed to the higher intrinsic "label sharpness" ($K_F$) of medical imaging
datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit
of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated
with the trained model's adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models
for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial
attack. Finally, we extend our $d_{data}$ formalism to the related metric of
learned representation intrinsic dimension ($d_{repr}$), derive a
generalization scaling law with respect to $d_{repr}$, and show that $d_{data}$
serves as an upper bound for $d_{repr}$. Our theoretical results are supported
by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging
datasets over a range of training set sizes. Our findings offer insights into
the influence of intrinsic dataset properties on generalization, representation
learning, and robustness in deep neural networks.

that help people with communication disabilities. AAC demonstrates its
transformative power by replacing spoken language with symbol sequences.
However, to unlock its full potential, AAC materials must adhere to specific
characteristics, placing the onus on educators to create custom-tailored
materials and symbols. This paper introduces AMBRA (Pervasive and Personalized
Augmentative and Alternative Communication based on Federated Learning and
Generative AI), an open platform that aims to leverage the capabilities of
foundation models to tackle many AAC issues, opening new opportunities (but
also challenges) for AI-enhanced AAC. We thus present a compelling vision--a
roadmap towards a more inclusive society. By leveraging the capabilities of
modern technologies, we aspire to not only transform AAC but also guide the way
toward a world where communication knows no bounds.

<p class="mathjax">Tabular data remains ubiquitous across domains despite growing use of images
and texts for machine learning. While deep learning models like convolutional
neural networks and transformers achieve strong performance on tabular data,
they require extensive data preprocessing, tuning, and resources, limiting
accessibility and scalability. This work develops an innovative approach based
on a structured state-space model (SSM), MambaTab, for tabular data. SSMs have
strong capabilities for efficiently extracting effective representations from
data with long-range dependencies. MambaTab leverages Mamba, an emerging SSM
variant, for end-to-end supervised learning on tables. Compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, MambaTab delivers superior performance while
requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal preprocessing, as
empirically validated on diverse benchmark datasets. MambaTab's efficiency,
scalability, generalizability, and predictive gains signify it as a
lightweight, "out-of-the-box" solution for diverse tabular data with promise
for enabling wider practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Swin Transformers (Swin) are currently
state-of-the-art in computational pathology. However, domain experts are still
reluctant to use these models due to their lack of interpretability. This is
not surprising, as critical decisions need to be transparent and
understandable. The most common approach to understanding transformers is to
visualize their attention. However, attention maps of ViTs are often
fragmented, leading to unsatisfactory explanations. Here, we introduce a novel
architecture called the B-cos Vision Transformer (BvT) that is designed to be
more interpretable. It replaces all linear transformations with the B-cos
transform to promote weight-input alignment. In a blinded study, medical
experts clearly ranked BvTs above ViTs, suggesting that our network is better
at capturing biomedically relevant structures. This is also true for the B-cos
Swin Transformer (Bwin). Compared to the Swin Transformer, it even improves the
F1-score by up to 4.7% on two public datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Keeping a vehicle well-localized within a prebuilt-map is at the core of any
autonomous vehicle navigation system. In this work, we show that both standard
SIR sampling and rejection-based optimal sampling are suitable for efficient
(10 to 20 ms) real-time pose tracking without feature detection that is using
raw point clouds from a 3D LiDAR. Motivated by the large amount of information
captured by these sensors, we perform a systematic statistical analysis of how
many points are actually required to reach an optimal ratio between efficiency
and positioning accuracy. Furthermore, initialization from adverse conditions,
e.g., poor GPS signal in urban canyons, we also identify the optimal particle
filter settings required to ensure convergence. Our findings include that a
decimation factor between 100 and 200 on incoming point clouds provides a large
savings in computational cost with a negligible loss in localization accuracy
for a VLP-16 scanner. Furthermore, an initial density of $\sim$2
particles/m$^2$ is required to achieve 100% convergence success for large-scale
($\sim$100,000 m$^2$), outdoor global localization without any additional hint

<p class="mathjax">Multi-touch attribution (MTA) currently plays a pivotal role in achieving a
fair estimation of the contributions of each advertising touchpoint to-wards
conversion behavior, deeply influencing budget allocation and advertising
recommenda-tion. Traditional multi-touch attribution methods initially build a
conversion prediction model, an-ticipating learning the inherent relationship
be-tween touchpoint sequences and user purchasing behavior through historical
data. Based on this, counterfactual touchpoint sequences are con-structed from
the original sequence subset, and conversions are estimated using the
prediction model, thus calculating advertising contributions. A covert
assumption of these methods is the un-biased nature of conversion prediction
models. However, due to confounding variables factors arising from user
preferences and internet recom-mendation mechanisms such as homogenization of
ad recommendations resulting from past shop-ping records, bias can easily occur
in conversion prediction models trained on observational data. This paper
redefines the causal effect of user fea-tures on conversions and proposes a

<p class="mathjax">As deep neural networks are more commonly deployed in high-stakes domains,
their lack of interpretability makes uncertainty quantification challenging. We
investigate the effects of presenting conformal prediction
sets$\unicode{x2013}$a method for generating valid confidence sets in
distribution-free uncertainty quantification$\unicode{x2013}$to express
uncertainty in AI-advised decision-making. Through a large pre-registered
experiment, we compare the utility of conformal prediction sets to displays of
Top-1 and Top-k predictions for AI-advised image labeling. We find that the
utility of prediction sets for accuracy varies with the difficulty of the task:
while they result in accuracy on par with or less than Top-1 and Top-k displays
for easy images, prediction sets excel at assisting humans in labeling
out-of-distribution (OOD) images especially when the set size is small. Our
results empirically pinpoint the practical challenges of conformal prediction
sets and provide implications on how to incorporate them for real-world
decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Hypergraphs are a natural and powerful choice for modeling group interactions
in the real world, which are often referred to as higher-order networks. For
example, when modeling collaboration networks, where collaborations can involve
not just two but three or more people, employing hypergraphs allows us to
explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic)
patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities
and challenges for learning and mining on hypergraphs, and hypergraph mining,
which seeks to enhance our understanding of underlying systems through
hypergraph modeling, gained increasing attention in research. Researchers have
discovered various structural patterns in real-world hypergraphs, leading to
the development of mining tools. Moreover, they have designed generators with
the aim of reproducing and thereby shedding light on these patterns. In this
survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of
hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide
comprehensive taxonomies for them, and we also provide in-depth discussions to
provide insights into future research on hypergraph mining.

<p class="mathjax">Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) have transcended their traditional use-case
of rendering graphics and nowadays also serve as a powerful platform for
accelerating ubiquitous, non-graphical rendering tasks. One prominent task is
inference of neural networks, which process vast amounts of personal data, such
as audio, text or images. Thus, GPUs became integral components for handling
vast amounts of potentially confidential data, which has awakened the interest
of security researchers. This lead to the discovery of various vulnerabilities
in GPUs in recent years. In this paper, we uncover yet another vulnerability
class in GPUs: We found that some GPU implementations lack proper register
initialization routines before shader execution, leading to unintended register
content leakage of previously executed shader kernels. We showcase the
existence of the aforementioned vulnerability on products of 3 major vendors -
Apple, NVIDIA and Qualcomm. The vulnerability poses unique challenges to an
adversary due to opaque scheduling and register remapping algorithms present in
the GPU firmware, complicating the reconstruction of leaked data. In order to
illustrate the real-world impact of this flaw, we showcase how these challenges
can be solved for attacking various workloads on the GPU. First, we showcase
how uninitialized registers leak arbitrary pixel data processed by fragment
shaders. We further implement information leakage attacks on intermediate data
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and present the attack's capability to
leak and reconstruct the output of Large Language Models (LLMs).

<p class="mathjax">Developing the proper representations for simulating high-speed flows with
strong shock waves, rarefactions, and contact discontinuities has been a
long-standing question in numerical analysis. Herein, we employ neural
operators to solve Riemann problems encountered in compressible flows for
extreme pressure jumps (up to $10^{10}$ pressure ratio). In particular, we
first consider the DeepONet that we train in a two-stage process, following the
recent work of Lee and Shin, wherein the first stage, a basis is extracted from
the trunk net, which is orthonormalized and subsequently is used in the second
stage in training the branch net. This simple modification of DeepONet has a
profound effect on its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness and leads to very
accurate solutions to Riemann problems compared to the vanilla version. It also
enables us to interpret the results physically as the hierarchical data-driven
produced basis reflects all the flow features that would otherwise be
introduced using ad hoc feature expansion layers. We also compare the results
with another neural operator based on the U-Net for low, intermediate, and very
high-pressure ratios that are very accurate for Riemann problems, especially
for large pressure ratios, due to their multiscale nature but computationally
more expensive. Overall, our study demonstrates that simple neural network
architectures, if properly pre-trained, can achieve very accurate solutions of
Riemann problems for real-time forecasting.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the first Natural Office Talkers in Settings of Far-field Audio
Recordings (``NOTSOFAR-1'') Challenge alongside datasets and baseline system.
The challenge focuses on distant speaker diarization and automatic speech
recognition (DASR) in far-field meeting scenarios, with single-channel and
known-geometry multi-channel tracks, and serves as a launch platform for two
new datasets: First, a benchmarking dataset of 315 meetings, averaging 6
minutes each, capturing a broad spectrum of real-world acoustic conditions and
conversational dynamics. It is recorded across 30 conference rooms, featuring
4-8 attendees and a total of 35 unique speakers. Second, a 1000-hour simulated
training dataset, synthesized with enhanced authenticity for real-world
generalization, incorporating 15,000 real acoustic transfer functions. The
tasks focus on single-device DASR, where multi-channel devices always share the
same known geometry. This is aligned with common setups in actual conference
rooms, and avoids technical complexities associated with multi-device tasks. It
also allows for the development of geometry-specific solutions. The NOTSOFAR-1
Challenge aims to advance research in the field of distant conversational
speech recognition, providing key resources to unlock the potential of
data-driven methods, which we believe are currently constrained by the absence
of comprehensive high-quality training and benchmarking datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Audio embeddings are crucial tools in understanding large catalogs of music.
Typically embeddings are evaluated on the basis of the performance they provide
in a wide range of downstream tasks, however few studies have investigated the
local properties of the embedding spaces themselves which are important in
nearest neighbor algorithms, commonly used in music search and recommendation.
In this work we show that when learning audio representations on music datasets
via contrastive learning, musical properties that are typically homogeneous
within a track (e.g., key and tempo) are reflected in the locality of
neighborhoods in the resulting embedding space. By applying appropriate data
augmentation strategies, localisation of such properties can not only be
reduced but the localisation of other attributes is increased. For example,
locality of features such as pitch and tempo that are less relevant to
non-expert listeners, may be mitigated while improving the locality of more
salient features such as genre and mood, achieving state-of-the-art performance
in nearest neighbor retrieval accuracy. Similarly, we show that the optimal
selection of data augmentation strategies for contrastive learning of music
audio embeddings is dependent on the downstream task, highlighting this as an
important embedding design decision.

<p class="mathjax">Many cloud systems utilize low-priority flows to achieve various performance
objectives (e.g., low latency, high utilization), relying on TCP as their
preferred transport protocol. However, the suitability of TCP for such
low-priority flows is relatively unexplored. Specifically, how
prioritization-induced delays in packet transmission can cause spurious
timeouts and low utilization. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to
investigate the performance of TCP for low-priority flows under a wide range of
realistic scenarios: use-cases (with accompanying workloads) where the
performance of low-priority flows is crucial to the functioning of the overall
system as well as various network loads and other network parameters. Our
findings yield two key insights: 1) for several popular use-cases (e.g.,
network scheduling), TCP's performance for low-priority flows is within 2x of a
near-optimal scheme, 2) for emerging workloads that exhibit an on-off behavior
in the high priority queue (e.g., distributed ML model training), TCP's
performance for low-priority flows is poor. Finally, we discuss and conduct
preliminary evaluation to show that two simple strategies -- weighted fair
queuing (WFQ) and cross-queue congestion notification -- can substantially
improve TCP's performance for low-priority flows.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of global tempo estimation in musical audio.
Given that annotating tempo is time-consuming and requires certain musical
expertise, few publicly available data sources exist to train machine learning
models for this task. Towards alleviating this issue, we propose a fully
self-supervised approach that does not rely on any human labeled data. Our
method builds on the fact that generic (music) audio embeddings already encode
a variety of properties, including information about tempo, making them easily
adaptable for downstream tasks. While recent work in self-supervised tempo
estimation aimed to learn a tempo specific representation that was subsequently
used to train a supervised classifier, we reformulate the task into the binary
classification problem of predicting whether a target track has the same or a
different tempo compared to a reference. While the former still requires
labeled training data for the final classification model, our approach uses
arbitrary unlabeled music data in combination with time-stretching for model
training as well as a small set of synthetically created reference samples for
predicting the final tempo. Evaluation of our approach in comparison with the
state-of-the-art reveals highly competitive performance when the constraint of
finding the precise tempo octave is relaxed.

<p class="mathjax">Since Adam was introduced, several novel adaptive optimizers for deep
learning have been proposed. These optimizers typically excel in some tasks but
may not outperform Adam uniformly across all tasks. In this work, we introduce
Meta-Adaptive Optimizers (MADA), a unified optimizer framework that can
generalize several known optimizers and dynamically learn the most suitable one
during training. The key idea in MADA is to parameterize the space of
optimizers and search through it using hyper-gradient descent. Numerical
results suggest that MADA is robust against sub-optimally tuned
hyper-parameters, and outperforms Adam, Lion, and Adan with their default
hyper-parameters, often even with optimized hyper-parameters. We also propose
AVGrad, a variant of AMSGrad where the maximum operator is replaced with
averaging, and observe that it performs better within MADA. Finally, we provide
a convergence analysis to show that interpolation of optimizers (specifically,
AVGrad and Adam) can improve their error bounds (up to constants), hinting at
an advantage for meta-optimizers.

data, processing batches of samples using complex of transformations, and
loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant
input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing
data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data
systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in
hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources -- or
worse -- underutilize expensive accelerators.
<br />To address these demands, we present cedar, a programming model and framework
that allows users to easily build, optimize, and execute input data pipelines.
cedar presents an easy-to-use programming interface, allowing users to define
input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML
frameworks and libraries. Meanwhile, cedar transparently applies a complex and
extensible set of optimization techniques (e.g., offloading, caching,
prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It then orchestrates processing across a
customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to
maximize processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. On
average across six diverse input data pipelines, cedar achieves a 2.49x, 1.87x,
2.18x, and 2.74x higher performance compared to tf.data, tf.data service, Ray
Data, and PyTorch's DataLoader, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Increasing integration of alternate electricity generation due to declining
fossil fuels is becoming an essential option for future generations. As
photovoltaic technology brings forth enormous benefits to the alternate
solution for future power grid systems, this paper presents a comprehensive
real-time system designed to model, control, and monitor a PV array subjected
to dynamic loads using the Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) environment.
Integration with the Generic Transducer Network (GTNET)- Socket(SKT) module
allows for the simulation of various environmental conditions, such as changes
in insolation and temperature, and their direct impact on the PV array's
performance. Utilizing BeagleBoard technology, the system demonstrates the
capability to modify these conditions through real-time data input,
subsequently observing the effects on current and voltage output curves. The
real-time simulation results are visualized as a SCADA system within the
Real-time Simulation for Automated Controller Design (RSCAD) runtime
environment, providing insights into the effective management of solar power
systems.

<p class="mathjax">Symmetries of input and latent vectors have provided valuable insights for
disentanglement learning in VAEs.However, only a few works were proposed as an
unsupervised method, and even these works require known factor information in
training data. We propose a novel method, Composite Factor-Aligned Symmetry
Learning (CFASL), which is integrated into VAEs for learning symmetry-based
disentanglement in unsupervised learning without any knowledge of the dataset
factor information.CFASL incorporates three novel features for learning
symmetry-based disentanglement: 1) Injecting inductive bias to align latent
vector dimensions to factor-aligned symmetries within an explicit learnable
symmetry codebook 2) Learning a composite symmetry to express unknown factors
change between two random samples by learning factor-aligned symmetries within
the codebook 3) Inducing group equivariant encoder and decoder in training VAEs
with the two conditions. In addition, we propose an extended evaluation metric
for multi-factor changes in comparison to disentanglement evaluation in VAEs.
In quantitative and in-depth qualitative analysis, CFASL demonstrates a
significant improvement of disentanglement in single-factor change, and
multi-factor change conditions compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Representations are at the core of all deep reinforcement learning (RL)
methods for both Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable
Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Many representation learning methods and
theoretical frameworks have been developed to understand what constitutes an
effective representation. However, the relationships between these methods and
the shared properties among them remain unclear. In this paper, we show that
many of these seemingly distinct methods and frameworks for state and history
abstractions are, in fact, based on a common idea of self-predictive
abstraction. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights into the widely
adopted objectives and optimization, such as the stop-gradient technique, in
learning self-predictive representations. These findings together yield a
minimalist algorithm to learn self-predictive representations for states and
histories. We validate our theories by applying our algorithm to standard MDPs,
MDPs with distractors, and POMDPs with sparse rewards. These findings culminate
in a set of practical guidelines for RL practitioners.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI has exhibited considerable potential to transform various
industries and public life. The role of news media coverage of generative AI is
pivotal in shaping public perceptions and judgments about this significant
technological innovation. This paper provides in-depth analysis and rich
insights into the temporal and spatial distribution of topics, sentiment, and
substantive themes within global news coverage focusing on the latest emerging
technology --generative AI. We collected a comprehensive dataset of news
articles (January 2018 to November 2023, N = 24,827). For topic modeling, we
employed the BERTopic technique and combined it with qualitative coding to
identify semantic themes. Subsequently, sentiment analysis was conducted using
the RoBERTa-base model. Analysis of temporal patterns in the data reveals
notable variability in coverage across key topics--business, corporate
technological development, regulation and security, and education--with spikes
in articles coinciding with major AI developments and policy discussions.
Sentiment analysis shows a predominantly neutral to positive media stance, with
the business-related articles exhibiting more positive sentiment, while
regulation and security articles receive a reserved, neutral to negative
sentiment. Our study offers a valuable framework to investigate global news
discourse and evaluate news attitudes and themes related to emerging
technologies.

<p class="mathjax">Confidential computing is a security paradigm that enables the protection of
confidential code and data in a co-tenanted cloud deployment using specialized
hardware isolation units called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). By
integrating TEEs with a Remote Attestation protocol, confidential computing
allows a third party to establish the integrity of an \textit{enclave} hosted
within an untrusted cloud. However, TEE solutions, such as Intel SGX and ARM
TrustZone, offer low-level C/C++-based toolchains that are susceptible to
inherent memory safety vulnerabilities and lack language constructs to monitor
explicit and implicit information-flow leaks. Moreover, the toolchains involve
complex multi-project hierarchies and the deployment of hand-written
attestation protocols for verifying \textit{enclave} integrity.
<br />We address the above with HasTEE+, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded
in Haskell that enables programming TEEs in a high-level language with strong
type-safety. HasTEE+ assists in multi-tier cloud application development by (1)
introducing a \textit{tierless} programming model for expressing distributed
client-server interactions as a single program, (2) integrating a general
remote-attestation architecture that removes the necessity to write
application-specific cross-cutting attestation code, and (3) employing a
dynamic information flow control mechanism to prevent explicit as well as
implicit data leaks. We demonstrate the practicality of HasTEE+ through a case
study on confidential data analytics, presenting a data-sharing pattern
applicable to mutually distrustful participants and providing overall
performance metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Audio embeddings enable large scale comparisons of the similarity of audio
files for applications such as search and recommendation. Due to the
subjectivity of audio similarity, it can be desirable to design systems that
answer not only whether audio is similar, but similar in what way (e.g., wrt.
tempo, mood or genre). Previous works have proposed disentangled embedding
spaces where subspaces representing specific, yet possibly correlated,
attributes can be weighted to emphasize those attributes in downstream tasks.
However, no research has been conducted into the independence of these
subspaces, nor their manipulation, in order to retrieve tracks that are similar
but different in a specific way. Here, we explore the manipulation of tempo in
embedding spaces as a case-study towards this goal. We propose tempo
translation functions that allow for efficient manipulation of tempo within a
pre-existing embedding space whilst maintaining other properties such as genre.
As this translation is specific to tempo it enables retrieval of tracks that
are similar but have specifically different tempi. We show that such a function
can be used as an efficient data augmentation strategy for both training of
downstream tempo predictors, and improved nearest neighbor retrieval of
properties largely independent of tempo.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition (FR) encompass two types:
impersonation attacks and evasion attacks. We observe that achieving a
successful impersonation attack on FR does not necessarily ensure a successful
dodging attack on FR in the black-box setting. Introducing a novel attack
method named Pre-training Pruning Restoration Attack (PPR), we aim to enhance
the performance of dodging attacks whilst avoiding the degradation of
impersonation attacks. Our method employs adversarial example pruning, enabling
a portion of adversarial perturbations to be set to zero, while tending to
maintain the attack performance. By utilizing adversarial example pruning, we
can prune the pre-trained adversarial examples and selectively free up certain
adversarial perturbations. Thereafter, we embed adversarial perturbations in
the pruned area, which enhances the dodging performance of the adversarial face
examples. The effectiveness of our proposed attack method is demonstrated
through our experimental results, showcasing its superior performance.

of new memory technologies and compute devices. GPUs alongside CPUs have become
commonplace and CXL is poised to be a mainstay of cloud systems. The operating
system is responsible for managing these hardware resources, requiring
modification every time a new device is released. Years of research and
development are sunk into tuning the OS for high performance with each new

domain-specific accelerators, it would be beneficial to have an OS that could
provide high performance for new devices without significant effort.
<br />We propose LLaMaS which can adapt to new devices easily. LLaMaS uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract the useful features of new devices from their
textual description and uses these features to make operating system decisions
at runtime. Adding support to LLaMaS for a new device is as simple as
describing the system and new device properties in plaintext.
<br />LLaMaS reduces the burden on system administrators to enable easy integration
of new devices into production systems.

extracting device features from text and make correct OS decisions based on
those features.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating test accuracy without access to the ground-truth test labels under
varying test environments is a challenging, yet extremely important problem in
the safe deployment of machine learning algorithms. Existing works rely on the
information from either the outputs or the extracted features of neural
networks to formulate an estimation score correlating with the ground-truth
test accuracy. In this paper, we investigate--both empirically and
theoretically--how the information provided by the gradients can be predictive
of the ground-truth test accuracy even under a distribution shift.
Specifically, we use the norm of classification-layer gradients, backpropagated
from the cross-entropy loss after only one gradient step over test data. Our
key idea is that the model should be adjusted with a higher magnitude of
gradients when it does not generalize to the test dataset with a distribution
shift. We provide theoretical insights highlighting the main ingredients of
such an approach ensuring its empirical success. Extensive experiments
conducted on diverse distribution shifts and model structures demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">An important development direction in the Single-Image Super-Resolution
(SISR) algorithms is to improve the efficiency of the algorithms. Recently,
efficient Super-Resolution (SR) research focuses on reducing model complexity
and improving efficiency through improved deep small kernel convolution,
leading to a small receptive field. The large receptive field obtained by large
kernel convolution can significantly improve image quality, but the
computational cost is too high. To improve the reconstruction details of
efficient super-resolution reconstruction, we propose a Symmetric Visual
Attention Network (SVAN) by applying large receptive fields. The SVAN
decomposes a large kernel convolution into three different combinations of
convolution operations and combines them with an attention mechanism to form a
Symmetric Large Kernel Attention Block (SLKAB), which forms a symmetric
attention block with a bottleneck structure by the size of the receptive field
in the convolution combination to extract depth features effectively as the
basic component of the SVAN. Our network gets a large receptive field while
minimizing the number of parameters and improving the perceptual ability of the
model. The experimental results show that the proposed SVAN can obtain
high-quality super-resolution reconstruction results using only about 30% of
the parameters of existing SOTA methods.

<p class="mathjax">Diacritization plays a pivotal role in improving readability and
disambiguating the meaning of Arabic texts. Efforts have so far focused on
marking every eligible character (Full Diacritization). Comparatively
overlooked, Partial Diacritzation (PD) is the selection of a subset of
characters to be marked to aid comprehension where needed. Research has
indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers--reducing
reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that
partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and
sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce
Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (CCPD)--a novel approach to PD which
integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. CCPD
processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes
only the characters with disparities between the two inferences. Further, we
introduce novel indicators for measuring partial diacritization quality (SR,
PDER, HDER, ERE), essential for establishing this as a machine learning task.
Lastly, we introduce TD2, a Transformer-variant of an established model which
offers a markedly different per formance profile on our proposed indicators
compared to all other known systems.

<p class="mathjax">In wireless communications, electromagnetic theory and information theory
constitute a pair of fundamental theories, bridged by antenna theory and
wireless propagation channel modeling theory. Up to the fifth generation (5G)
wireless communication networks, these four theories have been developing
relatively independently. However, in sixth generation (6G)
space-air-ground-sea wireless communication networks, seamless coverage is
expected in the three-dimensional (3D) space, potentially necessitating the
acquisition of channel state information (CSI) and channel capacity calculation
at anywhere and any time. Additionally, the key 6G technologies such as
ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and holographic MIMO
achieves intricate interaction of the antennas and wireless propagation
environments, which necessitates the joint modeling of antennas and wireless
propagation channels. To address the challenges in 6G, the integration of the
above four theories becomes inevitable, leading to the concept of the so-called
electromagnetic information theory (EIT). In this article, a suite of 6G key
technologies is highlighted. Then, the concepts and relationships of the four
theories are unveiled. Finally, the necessity and benefits of integrating them
into the EIT are revealed.

<p class="mathjax">Context. Software professionals learned from their experience during the
pandemic that most of their work can be done remotely, and now software
companies are expected to adopt hybrid work models to avoid the resignation of
talented professionals who require more flexibility and work-life balance.
However, hybrid work is a spectrum of flexible work arrangements, and
currently, there are no well-established hybrid work configurations to be
followed in the post-pandemic period. Goal. We investigated how software
engineers are experiencing the post-pandemic hybrid work landscape, aiming to
understand the factors that influence their choices between remote and
in-office work. Method. We explored a large South American company by
collecting quantitative and qualitative data from 545 software professionals
who are currently navigating diverse hybrid work arrangements tailored to their
individual and team requirements. Findings. Our study revealed an array of
factors that significantly impact hybrid work within the software industry,
including individual preferences, work-life balance, commute time, social
interactions, productivity, and more. Team dynamics, project demands, client
expectations, and organizational strategies also play an important role in
shaping the complex landscape of hybrid work configurations in software
engineering. Conclusions. In summary, the success of hybrid work models depends
on balancing individual preferences, team dynamics, and organizational
strategies. Our study demonstrated that, at present, there is no
one-size-fits-all individual approach to hybrid work in the software industry.

<p class="mathjax">Physical side-channel attacks can compromise the security of integrated
circuits. Most of the physical side-channel attacks (e.g., power or
electromagnetic) exploit the dynamic behavior of a chip, typically manifesting
as changes in current consumption or voltage fluctuations where algorithmic
countermeasures, such as masking, can effectively mitigate the attacks.
However, as demonstrated recently, these mitigation techniques are not entirely
effective against backscattered side-channel attacks such as impedance
analysis. In the case of an impedance attack, an adversary exploits the
data-dependent impedance variations of chip power delivery network (PDN) to
extract secret information. In this work, we introduce RandOhm, which exploits
moving target defense (MTD) strategy based on partial reconfiguration of
mainstream FPGAs, to defend against impedance side-channel attacks. We
demonstrate that the information leakage through the PDN impedance could be
reduced via run-time reconfiguration of the secret-sensitive parts of the
circuitry. Hence, by constantly randomizing the placement and routing of the
circuit, one can decorrelate the data-dependent computation from the impedance
value. To validate our claims, we present a systematic approach equipped with
two different partial reconfiguration strategies on implementations of the AES
cipher realized on 28-nm FPGAs. We investigate the overhead of our mitigation
in terms of delay and performance and provide security analysis by performing
non-profiled and profiled impedance analysis attacks against these
implementations to demonstrate the resiliency of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">The evolution of compression and enhancement algorithms necessitates an
accurate quality assessment for point clouds. Previous works consistently
regard point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) as a MOS regression problem and
devise a deterministic mapping, ignoring the stochasticity in generating MOS
from subjective tests. Besides, the viewpoint switching of 3D point clouds in
subjective tests reinforces the judging stochasticity of different subjects
compared with traditional images. This work presents the first probabilistic
architecture for no-reference PCQA, motivated by the labeling process of
existing datasets. The proposed method can model the quality judging
stochasticity of subjects through a tailored conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) and produces multiple intermediate quality ratings. These
intermediate ratings simulate the judgments from different subjects and are
then integrated into an accurate quality prediction, mimicking the generation
process of a ground truth MOS. Specifically, our method incorporates a Prior
Module, a Posterior Module, and a Quality Rating Generator, where the former
two modules are introduced to model the judging stochasticity in subjective
tests, while the latter is developed to generate diverse quality ratings.
Extensive experiments indicate that our approach outperforms previous
cutting-edge methods by a large margin and exhibits gratifying cross-dataset
robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative modeling.
In this paper, we propose PADS (Pose Analysis by Diffusion Synthesis), a novel
framework designed to address various challenges in 3D human pose analysis
through a unified pipeline. Central to PADS are two distinctive strategies: i)
learning a task-agnostic pose prior using a diffusion synthesis process to
effectively capture the kinematic constraints in human pose data, and ii)
unifying multiple pose analysis tasks like estimation, completion, denoising,
etc, as instances of inverse problems. The learned pose prior will be treated
as a regularization imposing on task-specific constraints, guiding the
optimization process through a series of conditional denoising steps. PADS
represents the first diffusion-based framework for tackling general 3D human
pose analysis within the inverse problem framework. Its performance has been
validated on different benchmarks, signaling the adaptability and robustness of
this pipeline.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting clouds and snow in remote sensing images is an essential
preprocessing task for remote sensing imagery. Previous works draw inspiration
from semantic segmentation models in computer vision, with most research
focusing on improving model architectures to enhance detection performance.
However, unlike natural images, the complexity of scenes and the diversity of
cloud types in remote sensing images result in many inaccurate labels in cloud
and snow detection datasets, introducing unnecessary noises into the training
and testing processes. By constructing a new dataset and proposing a novel
training strategy with the curriculum learning paradigm, we guide the model in
reducing overfitting to noisy labels. Additionally, we design a more
appropriate model performance evaluation method, that alleviates the
performance assessment bias caused by noisy labels. By conducting experiments
on models with UNet and Segformer, we have validated the effectiveness of our
proposed method. This paper is the first to consider the impact of label noise
on the detection of clouds and snow in remote sensing images.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a capable and intuitive structure for the
fundamental sequential decision-making problem. Despite impressive
breakthroughs, it can still be difficult to employ RL in practice in many
simple applications. In this paper, we try to address this issue by introducing
a method for designing the components of the RL environment for a given,
user-intended application. We provide an initial formalization for the problem
of RL component design, that concentrates on designing a good representation
for observation and action space. We propose a method named DeLF: Designing
Learning Environments with Foundation Models, that employs large language
models to design and codify the user's intended learning scenario. By testing
our method on four different learning environments, we demonstrate that DeLF
can obtain executable environment codes for the corresponding RL problems.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) exhibit remarkable performance for Novel View
Synthesis (NVS) given a set of 2D images. However, NeRF training requires
accurate camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Recent works have attempted to relax
this constraint, but they still often rely on decent initial poses which they
can refine. Here we aim at removing the requirement for pose initialization. We
present Incremental CONfidence (ICON), an optimization procedure for training
NeRFs from 2D video frames. ICON only assumes smooth camera motion to estimate
initial guess for poses. Further, ICON introduces ``confidence": an adaptive
measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON relies on
high-confidence poses to learn NeRF, and high-confidence 3D structure (as
encoded by NeRF) to learn poses. We show that ICON, without prior pose
initialization, achieves superior performance in both CO3D and HO3D versus
methods which use SfM pose.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning, the ability of a model to learn over time without
forgetting previous knowledge and, therefore, be adaptive to new data, is
paramount in dynamic fields such as disease outbreak prediction. Deep neural
networks, i.e., LSTM, are prone to error due to catastrophic forgetting. This
study introduces a novel CEL model for continual learning by leveraging domain
adaptation via Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). This model aims to mitigate
the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in a domain incremental setting. The
Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is constructed with EWC to develop a
regularization term that penalizes changes to important parameters, namely, the
important previous knowledge. CEL's performance is evaluated on three distinct
diseases, Influenza, Mpox, and Measles, with different metrics. The high
R-squared values during evaluation and reevaluation outperform the other
state-of-the-art models in several contexts, indicating that CEL adapts to
incremental data well. CEL's robustness and reliability are underscored by its
minimal 65% forgetting rate and 18% higher memory stability compared to
existing benchmark studies. This study highlights CEL's versatility in disease
outbreak prediction, addressing evolving data with temporal patterns. It offers
a valuable model for proactive disease control with accurate, timely
predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed inference is a popular approach for efficient DNN inference at
the edge. However, traditional Static and Dynamic DNNs are not
distribution-friendly, causing system reliability and adaptability issues. In
this paper, we introduce Fluid Dynamic DNNs (Fluid DyDNNs), tailored for
distributed inference. Distinct from Static and Dynamic DNNs, Fluid DyDNNs
utilize a novel nested incremental training algorithm to enable independent and
combined operation of its sub-networks, enhancing system reliability and
adaptability. Evaluation on embedded Arm CPUs with a DNN model and the MNIST
dataset, shows that in scenarios of single device failure, Fluid DyDNNs ensure
continued inference, whereas Static and Dynamic DNNs fail. When devices are
fully operational, Fluid DyDNNs can operate in either a High-Accuracy mode and
achieve comparable accuracy with Static DNNs, or in a High-Throughput mode and
achieve 2.5x and 2x throughput compared with Static and Dynamic DNNs,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">The escalating reliance on revolutionary online web services has introduced
heightened security risks, with persistent challenges posed by phishing despite
extensive security measures. Traditional phishing systems, reliant on machine
learning and manual features, struggle with evolving tactics. Recent advances
in deep learning offer promising avenues for tackling novel phishing challenges
and malicious URLs. This paper introduces a two-phase stack generalized model
named AntiPhishStack, designed to detect phishing sites. The model leverages
the learning of URLs and character-level TF-IDF features symmetrically,
enhancing its ability to combat emerging phishing threats. In Phase I, features
are trained on a base machine learning classifier, employing K-fold
cross-validation for robust mean prediction. Phase II employs a two-layered
stacked-based LSTM network with five adaptive optimizers for dynamic
compilation, ensuring premier prediction on these features. Additionally, the
symmetrical predictions from both phases are optimized and integrated to train
a meta-XGBoost classifier, contributing to a final robust prediction. The
significance of this work lies in advancing phishing detection with
AntiPhishStack, operating without prior phishing-specific feature knowledge.
Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets, comprising benign and
phishing or malicious URLs, demonstrates the model's exceptional performance,
achieving a notable 96.04% accuracy compared to existing studies. This research
adds value to the ongoing discourse on symmetry and asymmetry in information
security and provides a forward-thinking solution for enhancing network
security in the face of evolving cyber threats.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory optimization is a widely used technique in robot motion planning
for letting the dynamics and constraints on the system shape and synthesize
complex behaviors. Several previous works have shown its benefits in
high-dimensional continuous state spaces and under differential constraints.
However, long time horizons and planning around obstacles in non-convex spaces
pose challenges in guaranteeing convergence or finding optimal solutions. As a
result, discrete graph search planners and sampling-based planers are preferred
when facing obstacle-cluttered environments. A recently developed algorithm
called INSAT effectively combines graph search in the low-dimensional subspace
and trajectory optimization in the full-dimensional space for global
kinodynamic planning over long horizons. Although INSAT successfully reasoned
about and solved complex planning problems, the numerous expensive calls to an
optimizer resulted in large planning times, thereby limiting its practical use.
Inspired by the recent work on edge-based parallel graph search, we present
PINSAT, which introduces systematic parallelization in INSAT to achieve lower
planning times and higher success rates, while maintaining significantly lower
costs over relevant baselines. We demonstrate PINSAT by evaluating it on 6 DoF
kinodynamic manipulation planning with obstacles.

<p class="mathjax">An efficient, scalable, and provably secure dynamic auditing scheme is highly
desirable in the cloud storage environment for verifying the integrity of the
outsourced data. Most of the existing work on remote integrity checking focuses
on static archival data and therefore cannot be applied to cases where dynamic
data updates are more common. Additionally, existing auditing schemes suffer
from performance bottlenecks and scalability issues. To address these issues,
in this paper, we present a novel dynamic auditing scheme for centralized cloud
environments leveraging an enhanced version of the B-tree. Our proposed scheme
achieves the immutable characteristic of a decentralized system (i.e.,
blockchain technology) while effectively addressing the synchronization and
performance challenges of such systems. Unlike other static auditing schemes,
our scheme supports dynamic insert, update, and delete operations. Also, by
leveraging an enhanced B-tree, our scheme maintains a balanced tree after any
alteration to a certain file, improving performance significantly. Experimental
results show that our scheme outperforms both traditional Merkle Hash
Tree-based centralized auditing and decentralized blockchain-based auditing
schemes in terms of block modifications (e.g., insert, delete, update), block
retrieval, and data verification time.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the application of a unified non-orthogonal multiple
access framework in beam hopping (U-NOMA-BH) based satellite communication
systems. More specifically, the proposed U-NOMA-BH framework can be applied to
code-domain NOMA based BH (CD-NOMA-BH) and power-domain NOMA based BH
(PD-NOMA-BH) systems. To satisfy dynamic-uneven traffic demands, we formulate
the optimization problem to minimize the square of discrete difference by
jointly optimizing power allocation, carrier assignment and beam scheduling.
The non-convexity of the objective function and the constraint condition is
solved through Dinkelbach's transform and variable relaxation. As a further
development, the closed-from and asymptotic expressions of outage probability
are derived for CD/PD-NOMA-BH systems. Based on approximated results, the
diversity orders of a pair of users are obtained in detail. In addition, the
system throughput of U-NOMA-BH is discussed in delay-limited transmission mode.
Numerical results verify that: i) The gap between traffic requests of
CD/PD-NOMA-BH systems appears to be more closely compared with orthogonal
multiple access based BH (OMA-BH); ii) The CD-NOMA-BH system is capable of
providing the enhanced traffic request and capacity provision; and iii) The
outage behaviors of CD/PD-NOMA-BH are better than that of OMA-BH.

<p class="mathjax">Imitation learning (IL), aiming to learn optimal control policies from expert
demonstrations, has been an effective method for robot manipulation tasks.
However, previous IL methods either only use expensive expert demonstrations
and omit imperfect demonstrations or rely on interacting with the environment
and learning from online experiences. In the context of robotic manipulation,
we aim to conquer the above two challenges and propose a novel framework named
Similarity Weighted Behavior Transformer (SWBT). SWBT effectively learn from
both expert and imperfect demonstrations without interaction with environments.
We reveal that the easy-to-get imperfect demonstrations, such as forward and
inverse dynamics, significantly enhance the network by learning fruitful
information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt to
integrate imperfect demonstrations into the offline imitation learning setting
for robot manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark
built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks demonstrated that the proposed method can extract better features and
improve the success rates for all tasks. Our code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

<p class="mathjax">Probabilistic learning to rank (LTR) has been the dominating approach for
optimizing the ranking metric, but cannot maximize long-term rewards.
Reinforcement learning models have been proposed to maximize user long-term
rewards by formulating the recommendation as a sequential decision-making
problem, but could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to LTR counterparts,
primarily due to the lack of online interactions and the characteristics of
ranking. In this paper, we propose a new off-policy value ranking (VR)
algorithm that can simultaneously maximize user long-term rewards and optimize
the ranking metric offline for improved sample efficiency in a unified
Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. We theoretically and empirically show
that the EM process guides the leaned policy to enjoy the benefit of
integration of the future reward and ranking metric, and learn without any
online interactions. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods.

<p class="mathjax">Cascading bandits have gained popularity in recent years due to their
applicability to recommendation systems and online advertising. In the
cascading bandit model, at each timestep, an agent recommends an ordered subset
of items (called an item list) from a pool of items, each associated with an
unknown attraction probability. Then, the user examines the list, and clicks
the first attractive item (if any), and after that, the agent receives a
reward. The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected cumulative reward.
However, the prior literature on cascading bandits ignores the influences of
user states (e.g., historical behaviors) on recommendations and the change of
states as the session proceeds. Motivated by this fact, we propose a
generalized cascading RL framework, which considers the impact of user states
and state transition into decisions. In cascading RL, we need to select items
not only with large attraction probabilities but also leading to good successor
states. This imposes a huge computational challenge due to the combinatorial
action space. To tackle this challenge, we delve into the properties of value
functions, and design an oracle BestPerm to efficiently find the optimal item
list. Equipped with BestPerm, we develop two algorithms CascadingVI and
CascadingBPI, which are both computationally-efficient and sample-efficient,
and provide near-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees. Furthermore,
we present experiments to show the improved computational and sample
efficiencies of our algorithms compared to straightforward adaptations of
existing RL algorithms in practice.

<p class="mathjax">With the advancement of IoT technology, recognizing user activities with
machine learning methods is a promising way to provide various smart services
to users. High-quality data with privacy protection is essential for deploying
such services in the real world. Data streams from surrounding ambient sensors
are well suited to the requirement. Existing ambient sensor datasets only
support constrained private spaces and those for public spaces have yet to be
explored despite growing interest in research on them. To meet this need, we
build a dataset collected from a meeting room equipped with ambient sensors.
The dataset, DOO-RE, includes data streams from various ambient sensor types
such as Sound and Projector. Each sensor data stream is segmented into activity
units and multiple annotators provide activity labels through a
cross-validation annotation process to improve annotation quality. We finally
obtain 9 types of activities. To our best knowledge, DOO-RE is the first
dataset to support the recognition of both single and group activities in a
real meeting room with reliable annotations.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural network (DNN) inference is increasingly being executed on mobile
and embedded platforms due to several key advantages in latency, privacy and
always-on availability. However, due to limited computing resources, efficient
DNN deployment on mobile and embedded platforms is challenging. Although many
hardware accelerators and static model compression methods were proposed by
previous works, at system runtime, multiple applications are typically executed
concurrently and compete for hardware resources. This raises two main
challenges: Runtime Hardware Availability and Runtime Application Variability.
Previous works have addressed these challenges through either dynamic neural
networks that contain sub-networks with different performance trade-offs or
runtime hardware resource management. In this thesis, we proposed a combined
method, a system was developed for DNN performance trade-off management,
combining the runtime trade-off opportunities in both algorithms and hardware
to meet dynamically changing application performance targets and hardware
constraints in real time. We co-designed novel Dynamic Super-Networks to
maximise runtime system-level performance and energy efficiency on
heterogeneous hardware platforms. Compared with SOTA, our experimental results
using ImageNet on the GPU of Jetson Xavier NX show our model is 2.4x faster for
similar ImageNet Top-1 accuracy, or 5.1% higher accuracy at similar latency. We
also designed a hierarchical runtime resource manager that tunes both dynamic
neural networks and DVFS at runtime. Compared with the Linux DVFS governor
schedutil, our runtime approach achieves up to a 19% energy reduction and a 9%
latency reduction in single model deployment scenario, and an 89% energy
reduction and a 23% latency reduction in a two concurrent model deployment
scenario.

<p class="mathjax">One way to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
annotations. This approach does not show sufficiently strong generalization
ability, however, because the training only relies on the given CoT data. In
math problem-solving, for example, there is usually only one annotated
reasoning path for each question in the training data. Intuitively, it would be
better for the algorithm to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths given
a question. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach
called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the generalizability of
learning LLMs for reasoning, with math problem-solving as an example. ReFT
first warmups the model with SFT, and then employs on-line reinforcement
learning, specifically the PPO algorithm in this paper, to further fine-tune
the model, where an abundance of reasoning paths are automatically sampled
given the question and the rewards are naturally derived from the ground-truth
answers. Extensive experiments on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets show that
ReFT significantly outperforms SFT, and the performance can be potentially
further boosted by combining inference-time strategies such as majority voting
and re-ranking. Note that ReFT obtains the improvement by learning from the
same training questions as SFT, without relying on extra or augmented training
questions. This indicates a superior generalization ability for ReFT.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly prominent in the
field of artificial intelligence. Visual instruction fine-tuning (IFT) is a
vital process for aligning MLLMs' output with user's intentions. High-quality
and diversified instruction following data is the key to this fine-tuning
process. Recent studies propose to construct visual IFT datasets through a
multifaceted approach: transforming existing datasets with rule-based
templates, employing GPT-4 for rewriting annotations, and utilizing GPT-4V for
visual dataset pseudo-labeling. LLaVA-1.5 adopted similar approach and
construct LLaVA-mix-665k, which is one of the simplest, most widely used, yet
most effective IFT datasets today. Notably, when properly fine-tuned with this
dataset, MLLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.
However, we noticed that models trained with this dataset often struggle to
follow user instructions properly in multi-round dialog. In addition, tradition
caption and VQA evaluation benchmarks, with their closed-form evaluation
structure, are not fully equipped to assess the capabilities of modern
open-ended generative MLLMs. This problem is not unique to the LLaVA-mix-665k
dataset, but may be a potential issue in all IFT datasets constructed from
image captioning or VQA sources, though the extent of this issue may vary. We
argue that datasets with diverse and high-quality detailed instruction
following annotations are essential and adequate for MLLMs IFT. In this work,
we establish a new IFT dataset, with images sourced from the COCO dataset along
with more diverse instructions. Our experiments show that when fine-tuned with
out proposed dataset, MLLMs achieve better performance on open-ended evaluation
benchmarks in both single-round and multi-round dialog setting.

<p class="mathjax">Individuals with impaired hearing experience difficulty in conversations,
especially in noisy environments. This difficulty often manifests as a change
in behavior and may be captured via facial expressions, such as the expression
of discomfort or fatigue. In this work, we build on this idea and introduce the
problem of detecting hearing loss from an individual's facial expressions
during a conversation. Building machine learning models that can represent
hearing-related facial expression changes is a challenge. In addition, models
need to disentangle spurious age-related correlations from hearing-driven
expressions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised pre-training strategy
tailored for the modeling of expression variations. We also use adversarial
representation learning to mitigate the age bias. We evaluate our approach on a
large-scale egocentric dataset with real-world conversational scenarios
involving subjects with hearing loss and show that our method for hearing loss
detection achieves superior performance over baselines.

<p class="mathjax">One key challenge in Augmented Reality is the placement of virtual content in
natural locations. Most existing automated techniques can only work with a
closed-vocabulary, fixed set of objects. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate several methods for automatic object placement using recent advances
in open-vocabulary vision-language models. Through a multifaceted evaluation,
we identify a new state-of-the-art method, OCTO+. We also introduce a benchmark
for automatically evaluating the placement of virtual objects in augmented
reality, alleviating the need for costly user studies. Through this, in
addition to human evaluations, we find that OCTO+ places objects in a valid
region over 70% of the time, outperforming other methods on a range of metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance
wireless communication performance by enabling the local movement of antennas
at the transmitter (Tx) and/or receiver (Rx) for achieving more favorable
channel conditions. As the existing studies on MA-aided wireless communications
have mainly considered narrow-band transmission in flat fading channels, we
investigate in this paper the MA-aided wideband communications employing
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in frequency-selective fading
channels. Under the general multi-tap field-response channel model, the
wireless channel variations in both space and frequency are characterized with
different positions of the MAs. Unlike the narrow-band transmission where the
optimal MA position at the Tx/Rx simply maximizes the single-tap channel
amplitude, the MA position in the wideband case needs to balance the amplitudes
and phases over multiple channel taps in order to maximize the OFDM
transmission rate over multiple frequency subcarriers. First, we derive an
upper bound on the OFDM achievable rate in closed form when the size of the
Tx/Rx region for antenna movement is arbitrarily large. Next, we develop a
parallel greedy ascent (PGA) algorithm to obtain locally optimal solutions to
the MAs' positions for OFDM rate maximization subject to finite-size Tx/Rx
regions. To reduce computational complexity, a simplified PGA algorithm is also
provided to optimize the MAs' positions more efficiently. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed PGA algorithms can approach the OFDM rate upper
bound closely with the increase of Tx/Rx region sizes and outperform
conventional systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the wideband
channel setup.

<p class="mathjax">The radio map, serving as a visual representation of electromagnetic spatial
characteristics, plays a pivotal role in assessment of wireless communication
networks and radio monitoring coverage. Addressing the issue of low accuracy
existing in the current radio map construction, this paper presents a novel
radio map construction method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) in
which the Aggregated Contextual-Transformation (AOT) block, Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM), and Transposed Convolution (T-Conv) block are applied
to the generator, and we name it as ACT-GAN. It significantly improves the
reconstruction accuracy and local texture of the radio maps. The performance of
ACT-GAN across three different scenarios is demonstrated. Experiment results
reveal that in the scenario without sparse discrete observations, the proposed
method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 14.6% in comparison to the
state-of-the-art models. In the scenario with sparse discrete observations, the
RMSE is diminished by 13.2%. Furthermore, the predictive results of the
proposed model show a more lucid representation of electromagnetic spatial
field distribution. To verify the universality of this model in radio map
construction tasks, the scenario of unknown radio emission source is
investigated. The results indicate that the proposed model is robust radio map
construction and accurate in predicting the location of the emission source.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Long-Tailed Learning (Fed-LT), a paradigm wherein data collected
from decentralized local clients manifests a globally prevalent long-tailed
distribution, has garnered considerable attention in recent times. In the
context of Fed-LT, existing works have predominantly centered on addressing the
data imbalance issue to enhance the efficacy of the generic global model while
neglecting the performance at the local level. In contrast, conventional
Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) techniques are primarily devised to
optimize personalized local models under the presumption of a balanced global
data distribution. This paper introduces an approach termed Federated Local and
Generic Model Training in Fed-LT (FedLoGe), which enhances both local and
generic model performance through the integration of representation learning
and classifier alignment within a neural collapse framework. Our investigation
reveals the feasibility of employing a shared backbone as a foundational
framework for capturing overarching global trends, while concurrently employing
individualized classifiers to encapsulate distinct refinements stemming from
each client's local features. Building upon this discovery, we establish the
Static Sparse Equiangular Tight Frame Classifier (SSE-C), inspired by neural
collapse principles that naturally prune extraneous noisy features and foster
the acquisition of potent data representations. Furthermore, leveraging
insights from imbalance neural collapse's classifier norm patterns, we develop
Global and Local Adaptive Feature Realignment (GLA-FR) via an auxiliary global
classifier and personalized Euclidean norm transfer to align global features
with client preferences. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100-LT,
ImageNet, and iNaturalist demonstrate the advantage of our method over
state-of-the-art pFL and Fed-LT approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Compared with traditional design methods, generative design significantly
attracts engineers in various disciplines. In thiswork, howto achieve the
real-time generative design of optimized structures with various diversities
and controllable structural complexities is investigated. To this end, a
modified Moving Morphable Component (MMC) method together with novel strategies
are adopted to generate high-quality dataset. The complexity level of optimized
structures is categorized by the topological invariant. By improving the cost
function, the WGAN is trained to produce optimized designs with the input of
loading position and complexity level in real time. It is found that, diverse
designs with a clear load transmission path and crisp boundary, even not
requiring further optimization and different from any reference in the dataset,

<p class="mathjax">3D printing has enabled various applications using different forms of
materials, such as filaments, sheets, and inks. Typically, during 3D printing,
feedstocks are transformed into discrete building blocks and placed or
deposited in a designated location similar to the manipulation and assembly of
discrete objects. However, 3D printing of continuous and flexible tape (with
the geometry between filaments and sheets) without breaking or transformation
remains underexplored and challenging. Here, we report the design and
implementation of a customized end-effector, i.e., tape print module (TPM), to
realize robot tape manipulation for 3D printing by leveraging the tension
formed on the tape between two endpoints. We showcase the feasibility of
manufacturing representative 2D and 3D structures while utilizing conductive
copper tape for various electronic applications, such as circuits and sensors.
We believe this manipulation strategy could unlock the potential of other tape

<p class="mathjax">In vertical federated learning (VFL), commercial entities collaboratively
train a model while preserving data privacy. However, a malicious participant's
poisoning attack may degrade the performance of this collaborative model. The
main challenge in achieving the poisoning attack is the absence of access to
the server-side top model, leaving the malicious participant without a clear
target model. To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative end-to-end
poisoning framework P-GAN. Specifically, the malicious participant initially
employs semi-supervised learning to train a surrogate target model.
Subsequently, this participant employs a GAN-based method to produce
adversarial perturbations to degrade the surrogate target model's performance.
Finally, the generator is obtained and tailored for VFL poisoning. Besides, we
develop an anomaly detection algorithm based on a deep auto-encoder (DAE),
offering a robust defense mechanism to VFL scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of P-GAN and DAE, and further analyze the
factors that influence their performance.

novel learning-based method called ElliDock, which predicts an elliptic
paraboloid to represent the protein-protein docking interface. To be specific,
our model estimates elliptic paraboloid interfaces for the two input proteins
respectively, and obtains the roto-translation transformation for docking by
making two interfaces coincide. By its design, ElliDock is independently
equivariant with respect to arbitrary rotations/translations of the proteins,
which is an indispensable property to ensure the generalization of the docking
process. Experimental evaluations show that ElliDock achieves the fastest
inference time among all compared methods and is strongly competitive with
current state-of-the-art learning-based models such as DiffDock-PP and Multimer
particularly for antibody-antigen docking.

<p class="mathjax">Proof-of-Work is a consensus algorithm where miners solve cryptographic
puzzles to mine blocks and obtain a reward through some Block Reward Mechanism
(BRM). PoW blockchain faces the problem of centralization due to the formation
of mining pools, where miners mine blocks as a group and distribute rewards.
The rationale is to reduce the risk (variance) in reward while obtaining the
same expected block reward. In this work, we address the problem of
centralization due to mining pools in PoW blockchain. We propose a two-player
game between the new miner joining the system and the PoW blockchain system.
<br />We model the utility for the incoming miner as a combination of (i) expected
block reward, (ii) risk, and (iii) cost of switching between different mining
pools. With this utility structure, we analyze the equilibrium strategy of the
incoming miner for different BRMs: (a) memoryless -- block reward is history
independent (e.g., Bitcoin) (b) retentive: block reward is history-dependent
(e.g., Fruitchains). For memoryless BRMs, we show that depending on the
coefficient of switching cost $c$, the protocol is decentralized when $c = 0$
and centralized when $c &gt; \underline{c}$. In addition, we show the
impossibility of constructing a memoryless BRM where solo mining gives a higher
payoff than forming/joining mining pools. While retentive BRM in Fruitchains
reduces risk in solo mining, the equilibrium strategy for incoming miners is
still to join mining pools, leading to centralization. We then propose our
novel retentive BRM -- \textsf{Decent-BRM}. We show that under
\textsf{Decent-BRM}, incoming miners obtain higher utility in solo mining than
joining mining pools. Therefore, no mining pools are formed, and the Pow
blockchain using \textsf{Decent-BRM} is decentralized.

<p class="mathjax">The end-to-end ASR model is often desired in the streaming multilingual
scenario since it is easier to deploy and can benefit from pre-trained speech
models such as powerful foundation models. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous nature
and imbalanced data abundance of different languages may cause performance
degradation, leading to asynchronous peak performance for different languages
during training, especially on tail ones. Sometimes even the data itself may
become unavailable as a result of the enhanced privacy protection. Existing
work tend to significantly increase the model size or learn language-specific
decoders to accommodate each language separately. In this study, we explore
simple yet effective Language-Dependent Adapter (LDA) finetuning under a
cascaded Conformer transducer framework enhanced by teacher pseudo-labeling for
tail languages in the streaming multilingual ASR. The adapter only accounts for
0.4% of the full model per language. It is plugged into the frozen foundation
model and is the only trainable module during the finetuning process with noisy
student training. The final model merges the adapter parameters from different
checkpoints for different languages. The model performance is validated on a
challenging multilingual dictation dataset, which includes 39 tail languages
across Latin, Greek, Arabic, etc. Our proposed method brings 12.2% word error
rate reduction on average and up to 37.5% on a single locale. Furthermore, we
show that our parameter-efficient LDA can match the quality of the full model
finetuning, thus greatly alleviating the asynchronous peak performance issue.

<p class="mathjax">Prior research on young adults' mental health help-seeking mostly focuses on
one particular resource such as a mobile app or digital platform, paying less
attention to their lived experiences interacting with the ecosystem of
resources. We conducted in-depth interviews with 18 participants about their
help-seeking and non-help-seeking experiences. Guided by Social Ecological
Theory, we proposed a Socio-technical Ecosystem Framework for mental health
care, consisting of four levels of resources, including technological-,
interpersonal-, community-, and societal level resources. Using this framework,
we identified two types of support systems for help-seeking, single-resource
support system and multi-resource support system. These resources support young
adults' help-seeking via three mechanisms, \textit{care-giving},
\textit{care-mediating}, and \textit{care-outreaching}, forming various
pathways to care. We then pointed out the barriers to resource use at each
level and the general challenges in finding a support system. Our findings
contributed to a conceptual framework to categorize mental health care. It also
serves as a practical framework to identify challenges in the pathways to care
and discover design implications.

However, prior approaches often require resource-intensive training on super

applications. To address these challenges, we propose MicroNAS, a
hardware-aware zero-shot NAS framework designed for microcontroller units
(MCUs) in edge computing. MicroNAS considers target hardware optimality during
the search, utilizing specialized performance indicators to identify optimal

<p class="mathjax">With growing concerns surrounding privacy and regulatory compliance, the
concept of machine unlearning has gained prominence, aiming to selectively
forget or erase specific learned information from a trained model. In response
to this critical need, we introduce a novel approach called Attack-and-Reset
for Unlearning (ARU). This algorithm leverages meticulously crafted adversarial
noise to generate a parameter mask, effectively resetting certain parameters
and rendering them unlearnable. ARU outperforms current state-of-the-art
results on two facial machine-unlearning benchmark datasets, MUFAC and MUCAC.
In particular, we present the steps involved in attacking and masking that
strategically filter and re-initialize network parameters biased towards the
forget set. Our work represents a significant advancement in rendering data
unexploitable to deep learning models through parameter re-initialization,
achieved by harnessing adversarial noise to craft a mask.

<p class="mathjax">Homeostasis is a biological process by which living beings maintain their
internal balance. Previous research suggests that homeostasis is a learned
behaviour. Recently introduced Homeostatic Regulated Reinforcement Learning
(HRRL) framework attempts to explain this learned homeostatic behavior by
linking Drive Reduction Theory and Reinforcement Learning. This linkage has
been proven in the discrete time-space, but not in the continuous time-space.
In this work, we advance the HRRL framework to a continuous time-space
environment and validate the CTCS-HRRL (Continuous Time Continuous Space HRRL)
framework. We achieve this by designing a model that mimics the homeostatic
mechanisms in a real-world biological agent. This model uses the
Hamilton-Jacobian Bellman Equation, and function approximation based on neural
networks and Reinforcement Learning. Through a simulation-based experiment we
demonstrate the efficacy of this model and uncover the evidence linked to the
agent's ability to dynamically choose policies that favor homeostasis in a
continuously changing internal-state milieu. Results of our experiments
demonstrate that agent learns homeostatic behaviour in a CTCS environment,
making CTCS-HRRL a promising framework for modellng animal dynamics and
decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">In our research, we pioneer a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of
jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMa2,
diverging from traditional robustness-focused binary evaluations. Our study
introduces two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and
a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework, using a scoring range from 0 to 1,
offers a unique perspective, enabling a more comprehensive and nuanced
evaluation of attack effectiveness and empowering attackers to refine their
attack prompts with greater understanding. Furthermore, we have developed a
comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak tasks.
This dataset not only serves as a crucial benchmark for our current study but
also establishes a foundational resource for future research, enabling
consistent and comparative analyses in this evolving field. Upon meticulous
comparison with traditional evaluation methods, we discovered that our
evaluation aligns with the baseline's trend while offering a more profound and
detailed assessment. We believe that by accurately evaluating the effectiveness
of attack prompts in the Jailbreak task, our work lays a solid foundation for
assessing a wider array of similar or even more complex tasks in the realm of
prompt injection, potentially revolutionizing this field.

<p class="mathjax">Previous Face Anti-spoofing (FAS) works face the challenge of generalizing in
unseen domains. One of the major problems is that most existing FAS datasets
are relatively small and lack data diversity. However, we find that there are
numerous real faces that can be easily achieved under various conditions, which
are neglected by previous FAS works. In this paper, we conduct an Anomalous cue
Guided FAS (AG-FAS) method, which leverages real faces for improving model
generalization via a De-spoofing Face Generator (DFG). Specifically, the DFG
trained only on the real faces gains the knowledge of what a real face should
be like and can generate a "real" version of the face corresponding to any
given input face. The difference between the generated "real" face and the
input face can provide an anomalous cue for the downstream FAS task. We then
propose an Anomalous cue Guided FAS feature extraction Network (AG-Net) to
further improve the FAS feature generalization via a cross-attention
transformer. Extensive experiments on a total of nine public datasets show our
method achieves state-of-the-art results under cross-domain evaluations with
unseen scenarios and unknown presentation attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Stride determines the distance between adjacent filter positions as the
filter moves across the input. A fixed stride causes important information
contained in the image can not be captured, so that important information is
not classified. Therefore, in previous research, the DiffStride Method was
applied, namely the Strided Convolution Method with which it can learn its own
stride value. Severe Quantization and a constraining lower bound on preserved
information are arises with Max Pooling Downsampling Method. Spectral Pooling
reduce the constraint lower bound on preserved information by cutting off the
representation in the frequency domain. In this research a CNN Model is
proposed with the Downsampling Learnable Stride Technique performed by
Backpropagation combined with the Spectral Pooling Technique. Diffstride and
Spectral Pooling techniques are expected to maintain most of the information
contained in the image. In this study, we compare the Hybrid Method, which is a
combined implementation of Spectral Pooling and DiffStride against the Baseline
Method, which is the DiffStride implementation on ResNet 18. The accuracy
result of the DiffStride combination with Spectral Pooling improves over
DiffStride which is baseline method by 0.0094. This shows that the Hybrid
Method can maintain most of the information by cutting of the representation in
the frequency domain and determine the stride of the learning result through
Backpropagation.

highlights the `problem of induction' : the philosophical issue that past

models face when encountering new, unseen data. The paper argues for the
importance of not just making predictions but also providing good explanations,
a feature that current models often fail to deliver. It suggests that for AI to

equipment (UEs) in a typical disaster environment with mountainous forest and
obstacles. Towards this end, a joint deployment, power allocation, and user

proposed by integrating coalition game and virtual force approach which
captures the impact of the demand priority of UEs and the obstacles to the

<p class="mathjax">Understanding and predicting people flow in urban areas is useful for
decision-making in urban planning and marketing strategies. Traditional methods
for understanding people flow can be divided into measurement-based approaches
and simulation-based approaches. Measurement-based approaches have the
advantage of directly capturing actual people flow, but they face the challenge
of data imperfection. On the other hand, simulations can obtain complete data
on a computer, but they only consider some of the factors determining human
behavior, leading to a divergence from actual people flow. Both measurement and
simulation methods have unresolved issues, and combining the two can
complementarily overcome them. This paper proposes a method that applies data
assimilation, a fusion technique of measurement and simulation, to agent-based
simulation. Data assimilation combines the advantages of both measurement and
simulation, contributing to the creation of an environment that can reflect
real people flow while acquiring richer data. The paper verifies the
effectiveness of the proposed method in a virtual environment and demonstrates
the potential of data assimilation to compensate for the three types of
imperfection in people flow measurement techniques. These findings can serve as
guidelines for supplementing sparse measurement data in physical environments.

<p class="mathjax">The ResNet architecture has been widely adopted in deep learning due to its
significant boost to performance through the use of simple skip connections,
yet the underlying mechanisms leading to its success remain largely unknown. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical study of the ResNet architecture in
classification tasks by linearizing its constituent residual blocks using
Residual Jacobians and measuring their singular value decompositions. Our
measurements reveal a process called Residual Alignment (RA) characterized by
four properties:
<br />(RA1) intermediate representations of a given input are equispaced on a line,
embedded in high dimensional space, as observed by Gai and Zhang [2021];
<br />(RA2) top left and right singular vectors of Residual Jacobians align with
each other and across different depths;
<br />(RA3) Residual Jacobians are at most rank C for fully-connected ResNets,
where C is the number of classes; and
<br />(RA4) top singular values of Residual Jacobians scale inversely with depth.
<br />RA consistently occurs in models that generalize well, in both
fully-connected and convolutional architectures, across various depths and
widths, for varying numbers of classes, on all tested benchmark datasets, but
ceases to occur once the skip connections are removed. It also provably occurs
in a novel mathematical model we propose. This phenomenon reveals a strong
alignment between residual branches of a ResNet (RA2+4), imparting a highly
rigid geometric structure to the intermediate representations as they progress
linearly through the network (RA1) up to the final layer, where they undergo
Neural Collapse.

<p class="mathjax">Cyberbullying has become a big issue with the popularity of different social
media networks and online communication apps. While plenty of research is going
on to develop better models for cyberbullying detection in monolingual
language, there is very little research on the code-mixed languages and
explainability aspect of cyberbullying. Recent laws like "right to
explanations" of General Data Protection Regulation, have spurred research in
developing interpretable models rather than focusing on performance. Motivated
by this we develop the first interpretable multi-task model called {\em mExCB}
for automatic cyberbullying detection from code-mixed languages which can
simultaneously solve several tasks, cyberbullying detection,
explanation/rationale identification, target group detection and sentiment
analysis. We have introduced {\em BullyExplain}, the first benchmark dataset
for explainable cyberbullying detection in code-mixed language. Each post in
{\em BullyExplain} dataset is annotated with four labels, i.e., {\em bully
label, sentiment label, target and rationales (explainability)}, i.e., which
phrases are being responsible for annotating the post as a bully. The proposed
multitask framework (mExCB) based on CNN and GRU with word and sub-sentence
(SS) level attention is able to outperform several baselines and state of the
art models when applied on {\em BullyExplain} dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Sensory substitution or enhancement techniques have been proposed to enable
deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) people to listen to and even compose music.
However, little is known about how such techniques enhance DHH people's music
experience. Since deafness is a spectrum -- as are DHH people's preferences and
perceptions of music -- a more situated understanding of their interaction with
music is needed. To understand the music experience of this population, we
conducted social media analyses, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in the
deaf and hard of hearing Reddit communities. Our content analysis revealed that
DHH people leveraged sign language and visual/haptic cues to feel the music and
preferred familiar, non-lyrical, instrument-heavy, and loud music. In addition,
hearing aids were not customized for music, and the visual/haptic techniques
developed were not widely adopted by DHH people, leading to their suboptimal
music experiences. The DHH community embodied mutual support among music
lovers, evidenced by active information sharing and Q&amp;A around music and
hearing loss. We reflect on design justice for DHH people's music experience
and propose practical design implications to create a more accessible music
experience for them.

<p class="mathjax">Brain tumor represents one of the most fatal cancers around the world, and is
very common in children and the elderly. Accurate identification of the type
and grade of tumor in the early stages plays an important role in choosing a
precise treatment plan. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) protocols of
different sequences provide clinicians with important contradictory information
to identify tumor regions. However, manual assessment is time-consuming and
error-prone due to big amount of data and the diversity of brain tumor types.
Hence, there is an unmet need for MRI automated brain tumor diagnosis. We
observe that the predictive capability of uni-modality models is limited and
their performance varies widely across modalities, and the commonly used
modality fusion methods would introduce potential noise, which results in
significant performance degradation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel cross-modality guidance-aided multi-modal learning with dual attention
for addressing the task of MRI brain tumor grading. To balance the tradeoff
between model efficiency and efficacy, we employ ResNet Mix Convolution as the
backbone network for feature extraction. Besides, dual attention is applied to
capture the semantic interdependencies in spatial and slice dimensions
respectively. To facilitate information interaction among modalities, we design
a cross-modality guidance-aided module where the primary modality guides the
other secondary modalities during the process of training, which can
effectively leverage the complementary information of different MRI modalities
and meanwhile alleviate the impact of the possible noise.

<p class="mathjax">Data attribution methods trace model behavior back to its training dataset,
offering an effective approach to better understand ``black-box'' neural
networks. While prior research has established quantifiable links between model
output and training data in diverse settings, interpreting diffusion model
outputs in relation to training samples remains underexplored. In particular,
diffusion models operate over a sequence of timesteps instead of instantaneous
input-output relationships in previous contexts, posing a significant challenge
to extend existing frameworks to diffusion models directly. Notably, we present
Diffusion-TracIn that incorporates this temporal dynamics and observe that
samples' loss gradient norms are highly dependent on timestep. This trend leads
to a prominent bias in influence estimation, and is particularly noticeable for
samples trained on large-norm-inducing timesteps, causing them to be generally
influential. To mitigate this effect, we introduce Diffusion-ReTrac as a
re-normalized adaptation that enables the retrieval of training samples more
targeted to the test sample of interest, facilitating a localized measurement
of influence and considerably more intuitive visualization. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach through various evaluation metrics and auxiliary
tasks, reducing the amount of generally influential samples to $\frac{1}{3}$ of
its original quantity.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates a cooperative motion planning problem for large-scale
connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) under limited communications, which
addresses the challenges of high communication and computing resource
requirements. Our proposed methodology incorporates a parallel optimization
algorithm with improved consensus ADMM considering a more realistic locally
connected topology network, and time complexity of O(N) is achieved by
exploiting the sparsity in the dual update process. To further enhance the
computational efficiency, we employ a lightweight evolution strategy for the
dynamic connectivity graph of CAVs, and each sub-problem split from the
consensus ADMM only requires managing a small group of CAVs. The proposed
method implemented with the receding horizon scheme is validated thoroughly,
and comparisons with existing numerical solvers and approaches demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Also, simulations on large-scale
cooperative driving tasks involving 80 vehicles are performed in the
high-fidelity CARLA simulator, which highlights the remarkable computational
efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our proposed development.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction for enhancing user long-term
experiences in recommender systems by effectively exploring users' interests.
However, modern recommender systems exhibit distinct user behavioral patterns
among tens of millions of items, which increases the difficulty of exploration.
For example, user behaviors with different activity levels require varying
intensity of exploration, while previous studies often overlook this aspect and
apply a uniform exploration strategy to all users, which ultimately hurts user
experiences in the long run. To address these challenges, we propose
User-Oriented Exploration Policy (UOEP), a novel approach facilitating
fine-grained exploration among user groups. We first construct a distributional
critic which allows policy optimization under varying quantile levels of
cumulative reward feedbacks from users, representing user groups with varying
activity levels. Guided by this critic, we devise a population of distinct
actors aimed at effective and fine-grained exploration within its respective
user group. To simultaneously enhance diversity and stability during the
exploration process, we further introduce a population-level diversity
regularization term and a supervision module. Experimental results on public
recommendation datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms all other
baselines in terms of long-term performance, validating its user-oriented
exploration effectiveness. Meanwhile, further analyses reveal our approach's
benefits of improved performance for low-activity users as well as increased
fairness among users.

<p class="mathjax">Illegitimate intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) can pose significant
physical layer security risks on multi-user multiple-input single-output
(MU-MISO) systems. Recently, a DISCO approach has been proposed an illegitimate
IRS with random and time-varying reflection coefficients, referred to as a
"disco" IRS (DIRS). Such DIRS can attack MU-MISO systems without relying on
either jamming power or channel state information (CSI), and classical
anti-jamming techniques are ineffective for the DIRS-based fully-passive
jammers (DIRS-based FPJs). In this paper, we propose an IRS-enhanced
anti-jamming precoder against DIRS-based FPJs that requires only statistical
rather than instantaneous CSI of the DIRS-jammed channels. Specifically, a
legitimate IRS is introduced to reduce the strength of the DIRS-based jamming
relative to the transmit signals at a legitimate user (LU). In addition, the
active beamforming at the legitimate access point (AP) is designed to maximize
the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratios (SJNRs). Numerical results are
presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed IRS-enhanced
anti-jamming precoder against DIRS-based FPJs.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work on visual representation learning has shown to be efficient for
robotic manipulation tasks. However, most existing works pretrained the visual
backbone solely on 2D images or egocentric videos, ignoring the fact that
robots learn to act in 3D space, which is hard to learn from 2D observation. In
this paper, we examine the effectiveness of pretraining for vision backbone
with public-available large-scale 3D data to improve manipulation policy
learning. Our method, namely Depth-aware Pretraining for Robotics (DPR),
enables an RGB-only backbone to learn 3D scene representations from
self-supervised contrastive learning, where depth information serves as
auxiliary knowledge. No 3D information is necessary during manipulation policy
learning and inference, making our model enjoy both efficiency and
effectiveness in 3D space manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce a new way to
inject robots' proprioception into the policy networks that makes the
manipulation model robust and generalizable. We demonstrate in experiments that
our proposed framework improves performance on unseen objects and visual
environments for various robotics tasks on both simulated and real robots.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized many areas (e.g. natural
language processing, software engineering, etc.) by achieving state-of-the-art
performance on extensive downstream tasks. Aiming to achieve robust and general
artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating
the reasoning ability of the LLMs. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning
benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard
to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving
positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the
LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require
common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement
learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several
state-of-the-art LLMs' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic
programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative
and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis
systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust
deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples. Our evaluations illustrate that
compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in
model size, the state-of-the-art LLMs are much poorer in terms of reasoning
ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization using either
natural language prompting or truth-value matrix prompting.

<p class="mathjax">The evolution of information-seeking processes, driven by search engines like
Google, has transformed the access to information people have. This paper
investigates how individuals' preexisting attitudes influence the modern
information-seeking process, specifically the results presented by Google
Search. Through a comprehensive study involving surveys and information-seeking
tasks focusing on the topic of abortion, the paper provides four crucial
insights: 1) Individuals with opposing attitudes on abortion receive different
search results. 2) Individuals express their beliefs in their choice of
vocabulary used in formulating the search queries, shaping the outcome of the
search. 3) Additionally, the user's search history contributes to divergent
results among those with opposing attitudes. 4) Google Search engine reinforces
preexisting beliefs in search results. Overall, this study provides insights
into the interplay between human biases and algorithmic processes, highlighting
the potential for information polarization in modern information-seeking
processes.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-video generation aims to produce a video based on a given prompt.
Recently, several commercial video models have been able to generate plausible
videos with minimal noise, excellent details, and high aesthetic scores.
However, these models rely on large-scale, well-filtered, high-quality videos
that are not accessible to the community. Many existing research works, which
train models using the low-quality WebVid-10M dataset, struggle to generate
high-quality videos because the models are optimized to fit WebVid-10M. In this
work, we explore the training scheme of video models extended from Stable
Diffusion and investigate the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and
synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. We first
analyze the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models
and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. We observe that full training
of all modules results in a stronger coupling between spatial and temporal
modules than only training temporal modules. Based on this stronger coupling,
we shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation by
finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic
high-quality video model. Evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method, particularly in picture quality, motion,
and concept composition.

<p class="mathjax">Addressing the limitations of text as a source of accurate layout
representation in text-conditional diffusion models, many works incorporate
additional signals to condition certain attributes within a generated image.
Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific
localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In
this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control
over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of
global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we
first introduce \textit{depth disentanglement training} to leverage the
relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the
absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image
triplets. We also introduce \textit{soft guidance}, a method for imposing
global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional
localization cues. Our integrated framework, \textsc{Compose and Conquer
(CnC)}, unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a
disentangled manner. We demonstrate that our approach allows perception of
objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing
localized objects with different global semantics. Code:

<p class="mathjax">Automated vehicles require an accurate perception of their surroundings for
safe and efficient driving. Lidar-based object detection is a widely used
method for environment perception, but its performance is significantly
affected by adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog. In this work, we
investigate various strategies for enhancing the robustness of lidar-based
object detection by processing sequential data samples generated by lidar
sensors. Our approaches leverage temporal information to improve a lidar object
detection model, without the need for additional filtering or pre-processing
steps. We compare $10$ different neural network architectures that process
point cloud sequences including a novel augmentation strategy introducing a
temporal offset between frames of a sequence during training and evaluate the
effectiveness of all strategies on lidar point clouds under adverse weather
conditions through experiments. Our research provides a comprehensive study of
effective methods for mitigating the effects of adverse weather on the
reliability of lidar-based object detection using sequential data that are
evaluated using public datasets such as nuScenes, Dense, and the Canadian
Adverse Driving Conditions Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that our novel
method, involving temporal offset augmentation through randomized frame
skipping in sequences, enhances object detection accuracy compared to both the
baseline model (Pillar-based Object Detection) and no augmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Score distillation sampling (SDS) and its variants have greatly boosted the
development of text-to-3D generation, but are vulnerable to geometry collapse
and poor textures yet. To solve this issue, we first deeply analyze the SDS and
find that its distillation sampling process indeed corresponds to the
trajectory sampling of a stochastic differential equation (SDE): SDS samples
along an SDE trajectory to yield a less noisy sample which then serves as a
guidance to optimize a 3D model. However, the randomness in SDE sampling often
leads to a diverse and unpredictable sample which is not always less noisy, and
thus is not a consistently correct guidance, explaining the vulnerability of
SDS. Since for any SDE, there always exists an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) whose trajectory sampling can deterministically and consistently converge
to the desired target point as the SDE, we propose a novel and effective
"Consistent3D" method that explores the ODE deterministic sampling prior for
text-to-3D generation. Specifically, at each training iteration, given a
rendered image by a 3D model, we first estimate its desired 3D score function
by a pre-trained 2D diffusion model, and build an ODE for trajectory sampling.
Next, we design a consistency distillation sampling loss which samples along
the ODE trajectory to generate two adjacent samples and uses the less noisy
sample to guide another more noisy one for distilling the deterministic prior
into the 3D model. Experimental results show the efficacy of our Consistent3D
in generating high-fidelity and diverse 3D objects and large-scale scenes, as
shown in Fig. 1. The codes are available at
https://github.com/sail-sg/Consistent3D.

proliferation of LLM-powered user experiences. In product teams, designers are
often tasked with crafting user experiences that align with user needs. To
involve designers and leverage their user-centered perspectives to create
effective and responsible LLM-powered products, we introduce the practice of
designerly adaptation for engaging with LLMs as an adaptable design material.
We first identify key characteristics of designerly adaptation through a
formative study with designers experienced in designing for LLM-powered
products (N=12). These characteristics are 1) have a low technical barrier to
entry, 2) leverage designers' unique perspectives bridging users and
technology, and 3) encourage model tinkering. Based on this characterization,
we build Canvil, a Figma widget that operationalizes designerly adaptation.
Canvil supports structured authoring of system prompts to adapt LLM behavior,
testing of adapted models on diverse user inputs, and integration of model
outputs into interface designs. We use Canvil as a technology probe in a
group-based design study (6 groups, N=17) to investigate the implications of
integrating designerly adaptation into design workflows. We find that designers
are able to iteratively tinker with different adaptation approaches and reason
about interface affordances to enhance end-user interaction with LLMs.
Furthermore, designers identified promising collaborative workflows for
designerly adaptation. Our work opens new avenues for collaborative processes
and tools that foreground designers' user-centered expertise in the crafting
and deployment of LLM-powered user experiences.

<p class="mathjax">Networks represent how the entities of a system are connected and can be
partitioned differently, prompting ways to compare partitions. Common
approaches for comparing network partitions include information-theoretic
measures based on mutual information and set-theoretic measures such as the
Jaccard index. These measures are often based on computing the agreement in
terms of overlap between different partitions of the same set. However, they
ignore link patterns which are essential for the organisation of networks. We
propose flow divergence, an information-theoretic divergence measure for
comparing network partitions, inspired by the ideas behind the Kullback-Leibler
divergence and the map equation for community detection. Similar to the
Kullback-Leibler divergence, flow divergence adopts a coding perspective and
compares two network partitions $\mathsf{M}_a$ and $\mathsf{M}_b$ by
considering the expected extra number of bits required to describe a random
walk on a network using $\mathsf{M}_b$ relative to reference partition
$\mathsf{M}_a$. Because flow divergence is based on random walks, it can be
used to compare partitions with arbitrary and different depths. We show that
flow divergence distinguishes between partitions that traditional measures
consider to be equally good when compared to a reference partition. Applied to
real networks, we use flow divergence to estimate the cost of overfitting in
incomplete networks and to visualise the solution landscape of network
partitions.

enhance self-supervised cross-modal contrastive learning in the field of point
cloud video understanding. Traditional supervised learning methods encounter
limitations due to data scarcity and challenges in label acquisition. To
address these issues, we propose a self-supervised learning method that
leverages the cross-modal relationship between point cloud videos and image

cross-modal contrastive learning techniques are employed to facilitate
effective comprehension of point cloud video. We also propose a multi-level

<p class="mathjax">Endovascular robots have been actively developed in both academia and
industry. However, progress toward autonomous catheterization is often hampered
by the widespread use of closed-source simulators and physical phantoms.
Additionally, the acquisition of large-scale datasets for training machine
learning algorithms with endovascular robots is usually infeasible due to
expensive medical procedures. In this chapter, we introduce CathSim, the first
open-source simulator for endovascular intervention to address these
limitations. CathSim emphasizes real-time performance to enable rapid
development and testing of learning algorithms. We validate CathSim against the
real robot and show that our simulator can successfully mimic the behavior of
the real robot. Based on CathSim, we develop a multimodal expert navigation
network and demonstrate its effectiveness in downstream endovascular navigation
tasks. The intensive experimental results suggest that CathSim has the
potential to significantly accelerate research in the autonomous
catheterization field. Our project is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">The caching paradigm has been introduced to alleviate backhaul traffic load
and to reduce latencies due to massive never ending increase in data traffic.
To fully exploit the benefits offered by caching, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) and device-to-device (D2D) communication can be further utilized. In
contrast to prior works, that strictly limits the content delivery routes up to
two hops, we explore a multi-hop communications scenario, where the UAVs, the
UEs, or both can relay the content to individual users. In this context, we
formulate the problem for joint route selection and power allocation to
minimize the overall system content delivery duration. First, motivated by the
limitations of existing works, we consider the case where the nodes may
transmit content simultaneously rather than sequentially and propose simple yet
effective approach to allocate the transmission power. Second, we design a
low-complexity greedy algorithm jointly handling route selection and power
allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed greedy
algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithm by up to 56.98% in terms of
content delivery duration while it achieves close-to-optimal performance.

of efficiently utilizing heterogeneous bare metal resources that may include
edge servers. To this end, microservice-based solutions where control plane
procedures are deconstructed in their fundamental building blocks are gaining
momentum. This letter proposes an optimization framework delivering the
partitioning and mapping of large-scale microservice graphs onto heterogeneous
bare metal deployments while minimizing the total network traffic among
servers. An efficient heuristic strategy for solving the optimization problem
is also provided. Simulation results show that, with the proposed framework, a

<p class="mathjax">Bi-static sensing is crucial for exploring the potential of networked sensing
capabilities in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, it
suffers from the challenging clock asynchronism issue. CSI ratio-based sensing
is an effective means to address the issue. Its performance bounds, particular
for Doppler sensing, have not been fully understood yet. This work endeavors to
fill the research gap. Focusing on a single dynamic path in high-SNR scenarios,
we derive the closed-form CRB. Then, through analyzing the mutual interference
between dynamic and static paths, we simplify the CRB results by deriving close
approximations, further unveiling new insights of the impact of numerous
physical parameters on Doppler sensing. Moreover, utilizing the new CRB and
analyses, we propose novel waveform optimization strategies for noise- and
interference-limited sensing scenarios, which are also empowered by closed-form
and efficient solutions. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate
the preciseness of the derived CRB results and analyses, with the aid of the
maximum-likelihood estimator. The results also demonstrate the substantial
enhanced Doppler sensing accuracy and the sensing capabilities for low-speed
target achieved by the proposed waveform design.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting when trained
on sequential tasks. Various continual learning (CL) methods often rely on
exemplar buffers or/and network expansion for balancing model stability and
plasticity, which, however, compromises their practical value due to privacy
and memory concerns. Instead, this paper considers a strict yet realistic
setting, where the training data from previous tasks is unavailable and the
model size remains relatively constant during sequential training. To achieve
such desiderata, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective method that
attributes forgetting to layer-wise parameter overwriting and the resulting
decision boundary distortion. This is achieved by the synergy between two key
components: HSIC-Bottleneck Orthogonalization (HBO) implements non-overwritten
parameter updates mediated by Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion in an
orthogonal space and EquiAngular Embedding (EAE) enhances decision boundary
adaptation between old and new tasks with predefined basis vectors. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy
performance, even with absolute superiority of zero exemplar buffer and 1.02x
the base model.

<p class="mathjax">DTMM is a library designed for efficient deployment and execution of machine
learning models on weak IoT devices such as microcontroller units (MCUs). The
motivation for designing DTMM comes from the emerging field of tiny machine
learning (TinyML), which explores extending the reach of machine learning to
many low-end IoT devices to achieve ubiquitous intelligence. Due to the weak
capability of embedded devices, it is necessary to compress models by pruning
enough weights before deploying. Although pruning has been studied extensively
on many computing platforms, two key issues with pruning methods are
exacerbated on MCUs: models need to be deeply compressed without significantly
compromising accuracy, and they should perform efficiently after pruning.
Current solutions only achieve one of these objectives, but not both. In this
paper, we find that pruned models have great potential for efficient deployment
and execution on MCUs. Therefore, we propose DTMM with pruning unit selection,
pre-execution pruning optimizations, runtime acceleration, and post-execution
low-cost storage to fill the gap for efficient deployment and execution of
pruned models. It can be integrated into commercial ML frameworks for practical
deployment, and a prototype system has been developed. Extensive experiments on
various models show promising gains compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graph (KG) based reasoning has been regarded as an effective means
for the analysis of semantic networks and is of great usefulness in areas of
information retrieval, recommendation, decision-making, and man-machine
interaction. It is widely used in recommendation, decision-making,
question-answering, search, and other fields. However, previous studies mainly
used low-level knowledge in the KG for reasoning, which may result in
insufficient generalization and poor robustness of reasoning. To this end, this
paper proposes a new inference approach using a novel knowledge augmentation
strategy to improve the generalization capability of KG. This framework
extracts high-level pyramidal knowledge from low-level knowledge and applies it
to reasoning in a multi-level hierarchical KG, called knowledge pyramid in this
paper. We tested some medical data sets using the proposed approach, and the
experimental results show that the proposed knowledge pyramid has improved the
knowledge inference performance with better generalization. Especially, when
there are fewer training samples, the inference accuracy can be significantly
improved.

<p class="mathjax">Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded
in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation
implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely
examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain
interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded
by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question,
we establish a theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial
aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering
implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly
computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations
reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also
accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency between nodes.
These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the
spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the
fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the
theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose
a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the
adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation.
Notably, our proposed SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and
dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent
deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily.
Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art models.

<p class="mathjax">The present work deals with the numerical resolution of coupled 3D-2D
problems arising from the simulation of fluid flow in fractured porous media
modeled via the Discrete Fracture and Matrix (DFM) model. According to the DFM
model, fractures are represented as planar interfaces immersed in a 3D porous
matrix and can behave as preferential flow paths, in the case of conductive
fractures, or can actually be a barrier for the flow, when, instead, the
permeability in the normal-to-fracture direction is small compared to the
permeability of the matrix. Consequently, the pressure solution in a DFM can be
discontinuous across a barrier, as a result of the geometrical dimensional
reduction operated on the fracture.
<br />The present work is aimed at developing a numerical scheme suitable for the
simulation of the flow in a DFM with fractures and barriers, using a mesh for
the 3D matrix non conforming to the fractures and that is ready for domain
decomposition. This is achieved starting from a PDE-constrained optimization
method, currently available in literature only for conductive fractures in a
DFM. First, a novel formulation of the optimization problem is defined to
account for non permeable fractures. These are described by a filtration-like
coupling at the interface with the surrounding porous matrix. Also the extended
finite element method with discontinuous enrichment functions is used to
reproduce the pressure solution in the matrix around a barrier.
<br />The method is presented here in its simplest form, for clarity of exposition,
i.e. considering the case of a single fracture in a 3D domain, also providing a
proof of the well posedness of the resulting discrete problem. Four validation
examples are proposed to show the viability and the effectiveness of the
method.

<p class="mathjax">We study best arm identification (BAI) in linear bandits in the fixed-budget
regime under differential privacy constraints, when the arm rewards are
supported on the unit interval. Given a finite budget $T$ and a privacy
parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the goal is to minimise the error probability in
finding the arm with the largest mean after $T$ sampling rounds, subject to the
constraint that the policy of the decision maker satisfies a certain {\em
$\varepsilon$-differential privacy} ($\varepsilon$-DP) constraint. We construct
a policy satisfying the $\varepsilon$-DP constraint (called {\sc DP-BAI}) by
proposing the principle of {\em maximum absolute determinants}, and derive an
upper bound on its error probability. Furthermore, we derive a minimax lower
bound on the error probability, and demonstrate that the lower and the upper
bounds decay exponentially in $T$, with exponents in the two bounds matching
order-wise in (a) the sub-optimality gaps of the arms, (b) $\varepsilon$, and
(c) the problem complexity that is expressible as the sum of two terms, one
characterising the complexity of standard fixed-budget BAI (without privacy
constraints), and the other accounting for the $\varepsilon$-DP constraint.
Additionally, we present some auxiliary results that contribute to the
derivation of the lower bound on the error probability. These results, we
posit, may be of independent interest and could prove instrumental in proving
lower bounds on error probabilities in several other bandit problems. Whereas
prior works provide results for BAI in the fixed-budget regime without privacy
constraints or in the fixed-confidence regime with privacy constraints, our
work fills the gap in the literature by providing the results for BAI in the
fixed-budget regime under the $\varepsilon$-DP constraint.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate
the execution of computer code and algorithms. We begin by looking straight
line programs, and show that current LLMs demonstrate poor performance even
with such simple programs -- performance rapidly degrades with the length of
code. We then investigate the ability of LLMs to simulate programs that contain
critical paths and redundant instructions. We also go beyond straight line
program simulation with sorting algorithms and nested loops, and we show the
computational complexity of a routine directly affects the ability of an LLM to
simulate its execution. We observe that LLMs execute instructions sequentially
and with a low error margin only for short programs or standard procedures.
LLMs' code simulation is in tension with their pattern recognition and
memorisation capabilities: on tasks where memorisation is detrimental, we
propose a novel prompting method to simulate code execution line by line.
Empirically, our new Chain of Simulation (CoSm) method improves on the standard
Chain of Thought prompting approach by avoiding the pitfalls of memorisation.

<p class="mathjax">Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is fundamental to seamlessly
integrating robotic systems into our daily lives. However, current
communication modes require additional technological interfaces, which can be
cumbersome and indirect. This paper presents a novel approach, using direct
motion-based communication by moving a robot's end effector. Our strategy
enables users to communicate with a robot by using four distinct gestures --
two handshakes ('formal' and 'informal') and two letters ('W' and 'S'). As a
proof-of-concept, we conducted a user study with 16 participants, capturing
subjective experience ratings and objective data for training machine learning
classifiers. Our findings show that the four different gestures performed by
moving the robot's end effector can be distinguished with close to 100%
accuracy. Our research offers implications for the design of future HRI
interfaces, suggesting that motion-based interaction can empower human
operators to communicate directly with robots, removing the necessity for
additional hardware.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper a higher-order mixed finite element method for elastoplasticity
with linear kinematic hardening is analyzed. Thereby, the non-differentiability
of the involved plasticity functional is resolved by a Lagrange multiplier
leading to a three field formulation. The finite element discretization is
conforming in the displacement field and the plastic strain but potentially
non-conforming in the Lagrange multiplier as its Frobenius norm is only
constrained in a certain set of Gauss quadrature points. A discrete inf-sup
condition with constant 1 and the well posedness of the discrete mixed problem
are shown. Moreover, convergence and guaranteed convergence rates are proved
with respect to the mesh size and the polynomial degree, which are optimal for
the lowest order case. Numerical experiments underline the theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">With the growing popularity of dialogue agents based on large language models
(LLMs), urgent attention has been drawn to finding ways to ensure their
behaviour is ethical and appropriate. These are largely interpreted in terms of
the 'HHH' criteria: making outputs more helpful and honest, and avoiding
harmful (biased, toxic, or inaccurate) statements. Whilst this semantic focus
is useful from the perspective of viewing LLM agents as mere mediums for
information, it fails to account for pragmatic factors that can make the same
utterance seem more or less offensive or tactless in different social
situations. We propose an approach to ethics that is more centred on relational
and situational factors, exploring what it means for a system, as a social
actor, to treat an individual respectfully in a (series of) interaction(s). Our
work anticipates a set of largely unexplored risks at the level of situated
interaction, and offers practical suggestions to help LLM technologies behave
as 'good' social actors and treat people respectfully.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the flourishing large language models(LLM), especially ChatGPT,
have shown exceptional performance in language understanding, reasoning, and
interaction, attracting users and researchers from multiple fields and domains.
Although LLMs have shown great capacity to perform human-like task
accomplishment in natural language and natural image, their potential in
handling remote sensing interpretation tasks has not yet been fully explored.
Moreover, the lack of automation in remote sensing task planning hinders the
accessibility of remote sensing interpretation techniques, especially to
non-remote sensing experts from multiple research fields. To this end, we
present Remote Sensing ChatGPT, an LLM-powered agent that utilizes ChatGPT to
connect various AI-based remote sensing models to solve complicated
interpretation tasks. More specifically, given a user request and a remote
sensing image, we utilized ChatGPT to understand user requests, perform task
planning according to the tasks' functions, execute each subtask iteratively,
and generate the final response according to the output of each subtask.
Considering that LLM is trained with natural language and is not capable of
directly perceiving visual concepts as contained in remote sensing images, we
designed visual cues that inject visual information into ChatGPT. With Remote
Sensing ChatGPT, users can simply send a remote sensing image with the
corresponding request, and get the interpretation results as well as language
feedback from Remote Sensing ChatGPT. Experiments and examples show that Remote
Sensing ChatGPT can tackle a wide range of remote sensing tasks and can be
extended to more tasks with more sophisticated models such as the remote
sensing foundation model. The code and demo of Remote Sensing ChatGPT is
publicly available at https://github.com/HaonanGuo/Remote-Sensing-ChatGPT .

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion based video generation has received extensive attention and
achieved considerable success within both the academic and industrial
communities. However, current efforts are mainly concentrated on
single-objective or single-task video generation, such as generation driven by
text, by image, or by a combination of text and image. This cannot fully meet
the needs of real-world application scenarios, as users are likely to input
images and text conditions in a flexible manner, either individually or in
combination. To address this, we propose a Unified-modal Video Genearation
system that is capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text
and image modalities. To this end, we revisit the various video generation
tasks within our system from the perspective of generative freedom, and
classify them into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories.
For high-freedom video generation, we employ Multi-condition Cross Attention to
generate videos that align with the semantics of the input images or text. For
low-freedom video generation, we introduce Biased Gaussian Noise to replace the
pure random Gaussian Noise, which helps to better preserve the content of the
input conditions. Our method achieves the lowest Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD)
on the public academic benchmark MSR-VTT, surpasses the current open-source
methods in human evaluations, and is on par with the current close-source
method Gen2. For more samples, visit https://univg-baidu.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a framework to evaluate the random-coding union bound with
parameter $s$ on the achievable error probability in the finite-blocklength
regime for a pilot-assisted transmission scheme operating over an imperfectly
synchronized and memoryless block-fading waveform channel. Unlike previous
results, which disregard the effects of imperfect synchronization, our
framework utilizes pilots for both synchronization and channel estimation.
Specifically, we provide an algorithm to perform joint synchronization and
channel estimation and verify its accuracy by observing its tightness in
comparison with the Cramer-Rao bound. Then, we develop an RCUs bound on the
error probability, which applies for a receiver that treats the estimates
provided by the algorithm as accurate. Additionally, we utilize the saddlepoint
approximation to provide a numerically efficient method for evaluating the RCUs
bound in this scenario. Our numerical experiments verify the accuracy of the
proposed approximation. Moreover, when transmission blocks are received
synchronously, numerical results indicate that the number of pilot symbols
needed to estimate the fading channel gains to the level of accuracy required
in ultra-reliable low-latency communication is also sufficient to acquire
sufficiently good synchronization. However, when the blocks are received
asynchronously, synchronization becomes the bottleneck for the system
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential in biomedical fields.
However, how the public uses them for healthcare purposes such as medical Q\&amp;A,
self-diagnosis, and daily healthcare information seeking is under-investigated.
In this paper, we adopt a mixed-methods approach, including surveys (N=167) and
interviews (N=17) to investigate how and why the public uses LLMs for
healthcare. LLMs as a healthcare tool have gained popularity, and are often
used in combination with other information channels such as search engines and
online health communities to optimize information quality. LLMs provide more
accurate information and a more convenient interaction/service model compared
to traditional channels. LLMs also do a better job of reducing misinformation,
especially in daily healthcare questions. Doctors using LLMs for diagnosis is
less acceptable than for auxiliary work such as writing medical records. Based
on the findings, we reflect on the ethical and effective use of LLMs for
healthcare and propose future research directions.

<p class="mathjax">The ever-growing corpus of scientific literature presents significant
challenges for researchers with respect to discovery, management, and
annotation of relevant publications. Traditional platforms like Semantic
Scholar, BibSonomy, and Zotero offer tools for literature management, but
largely require manual laborious and error-prone input of tags and metadata.
Here, we introduce a novel retrieval augmented generation system that leverages
chat-based large language models (LLMs) to streamline and enhance the process
of publication management. It provides a unified chat-based interface, enabling
intuitive interactions with various backends, including Semantic Scholar,
BibSonomy, and the Zotero Webscraper. It supports two main use-cases: (1)
Explorative Search &amp; Retrieval - leveraging LLMs to search for and retrieve
both specific and general scientific publications, while addressing the
challenges of content hallucination and data obsolescence; and (2) Cataloguing
&amp; Management - aiding in the organization of personal publication libraries, in
this case BibSonomy, by automating the addition of metadata and tags, while
facilitating manual edits and updates. We compare our system to different LLM
models in three different settings, including a user study, and we can show its
advantages in different metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, such as LSTM and
GRU, have historically held prominence in time series tasks. However, they have
recently seen a decline in their dominant position across various time series
tasks. As a result, recent advancements in time series forecasting have seen a
notable shift away from RNNs towards alternative architectures such as
Transformers, MLPs, and CNNs. To go beyond the limitations of traditional RNNs,
we design an efficient RNN-based model for time series tasks, named RWKV-TS,
with three distinctive features: (i) A novel RNN architecture characterized by
$O(L)$ time complexity and memory usage. (ii) An enhanced ability to capture
long-term sequence information compared to traditional RNNs. (iii) High
computational efficiency coupled with the capacity to scale up effectively.
Through extensive experimentation, our proposed RWKV-TS model demonstrates
competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based or
CNN-based models. Notably, RWKV-TS exhibits not only comparable performance but
also demonstrates reduced latency and memory utilization. The success of
RWKV-TS encourages further exploration and innovation in leveraging RNN-based
approaches within the domain of Time Series. The combination of competitive
performance, low latency, and efficient memory usage positions RWKV-TS as a
promising avenue for future research in time series tasks. Code is available

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and robust localization and mapping are essential components for
most autonomous robots. In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building
globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and
compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range
measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of
the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the
current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model
registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points,
which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment
when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features.
Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments
and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras.
PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the
state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent
neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly
compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes.
Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and
the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association,
PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be
available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.

<p class="mathjax">In the evolving landscape of Internet technologies, where decentralized
systems, especially blockchain-based computation and storage like Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM), Arweave, and IPFS, are gaining prominence, there remains
a stark absence of a holistic decentralized communication framework. This gap
underlines the pressing necessity for a protocol that not only enables seamless
cross-platform messaging but also allows direct messaging to wallet addresses,
fostering interoperability and privacy across diverse platforms. SendingNetwork
addresses this need by creating a reliable and secure decentralized
communication network, targeting essential challenges like privacy protection,
scalability, efficiency, and composability. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of edge computing to form an adaptive relay network with the
modular libp2p library. We introduce a dynamic group chat encryption mechanism
based on the Double Ratchet algorithm for secure communication and propose a
Delegation scheme for efficient message processing in large group chats,
enhancing both resilience and scalability. Our theoretical analyses affirm the
Delegation scheme's superior performance. To bolster system stability and
encourage node participation, we integrate two innovative consensus mechanisms:
"Proof of Relay" for validating message relay workload based on the novel KZG
commitment, and "Proof of Availability" for ensuring network consistency and
managing incentives through Verkle trees. Our whitepaper details the network's
key components and architecture, concluding with a roadmap and a preview of
future enhancements to SendingNetwork.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a reliable a posteriori error estimator for a model problem of
elastoplasticity with linear kinematic hardening is derived, which satisfies
some (local) efficiency estimates. It is applicable to any discretization that
is conforming with respect to the displacement field and the plastic strain.
Furthermore, the paper presents $hp$-finite element discretizations relying on
a variational inequality as well as on a mixed variational formulation and
discusses their equivalence by using biorthogonal basis functions. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical findings and
underline the potential of $h$- and $hp$-adaptive finite element
discretizations for problems of elastoplasticity.

<p class="mathjax">Do deep learning models for instance segmentation generalize to novel objects
in a systematic way? For classification, such behavior has been questioned. In
this study, we aim to understand if certain design decisions such as framework,
architecture or pre-training contribute to the semantic understanding of
instance segmentation. To answer this question, we consider a special case of
robustness and compare pre-trained models on a challenging benchmark for
object-centric, out-of-distribution texture. We do not introduce another method
in this work. Instead, we take a step back and evaluate a broad range of
existing literature. This includes Cascade and Mask R-CNN, Swin Transformer,
BMask, YOLACT(++), DETR, BCNet, SOTR and SOLOv2. We find that YOLACT++, SOTR
and SOLOv2 are significantly more robust to out-of-distribution texture than
other frameworks. In addition, we show that deeper and dynamic architectures
improve robustness whereas training schedules, data augmentation and
pre-training have only a minor impact. In summary we evaluate 68 models on 61
versions of MS COCO for a total of 4148 evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate decentralized state estimation for a discrete event system in
a setting where the information received at a coordinator may be corrupted or
tampered by a malicious attacker. Specifically, a system is observed by a set
of (local) observation sites (OSs) which occasionally send their recorded
sequences of observations to the coordinator that is in charge of estimating
the system state. The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this
paper, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which
bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are
proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information
processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local
errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these
types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information
processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle errors and
failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently
perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original
system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original
system. For each method, we adopt an estimation-by-release methodology to
design an algorithm for constructing a corresponding synchronizer for state
estimation.

<p class="mathjax">To enhance perception performance in complex and extensive scenarios within
the realm of autonomous driving, there has been a noteworthy focus on temporal
modeling, with a particular emphasis on streaming methods. The prevailing trend
in streaming models involves the utilization of stream queries for the
propagation of temporal information. Despite the prevalence of this approach,
the direct application of the streaming paradigm to the construction of
vectorized high-definition maps (HD-maps) fails to fully harness the inherent
potential of temporal information. This paper introduces the Stream Query
Denoising (SQD) strategy as a novel approach for temporal modeling in
high-definition map (HD-map) construction. SQD is designed to facilitate the
learning of temporal consistency among map elements within the streaming model.
The methodology involves denoising the queries that have been perturbed by the
addition of noise to the ground-truth information from the preceding frame.
This denoising process aims to reconstruct the ground-truth information for the
current frame, thereby simulating the prediction process inherent in stream
queries. The SQD strategy can be applied to those streaming methods (e.g.,
StreamMapNet) to enhance the temporal modeling. The proposed SQD-MapNet is the
StreamMapNet equipped with SQD. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and
Argoverse2 show that our method is remarkably superior to other existing
methods across all settings of close range and long range. The code will be
available soon.

<p class="mathjax">Parallel robots (PRs) are closed-chain manipulators with diverse applications
due to their accuracy and high payload. However, there are configurations
within the workspace named Type II singularities where the PRs lose control of
the end-effector movements. Type II singularities are a problem for
applications where complete control of the end-effector is essential.
Trajectory planning produces accurate movements of a PR by avoiding Type II
singularities. Generally, singularity avoidance is achieved by optimising a
geometrical path with a velocity profile considering singular configurations as
obstacles. This research presents an algorithm that avoids Type II
singularities by modifying the trajectory of a subset of the actuators. The
subset of actuators represents the limbs responsible for a Type II singularity,
and they are identified by the angle between two Output Twist Screws. The
proposed avoidance algorithm does not require optimisation procedures, which
reduces the computational cost for offline trajectory planning and makes it
suitable for online trajectory planning. The avoidance algorithm is implemented
in offline trajectory planning for a pick and place planar PR and a spatial
knee rehabilitation PR

for partial differential equations. In this paper, a learning based numerical
method (LbNM) is proposed for Helmholtz equation with high frequency. The main
novelty is using Tikhonov regularization method to stably learn the solution
operator by utilizing relevant information especially the fundamental
solutions. Then applying the solution operator to a new boundary input could
quickly update the solution. Based on the method of fundamental solutions and
the quantitative Runge approximation, we give the error estimate. This
indicates interpretability and generalizability of the present method.
Numerical results validates the error analysis and demonstrates the

<p class="mathjax">The Healthcare Internet-of-Things (H-IoT), commonly known as Digital
Healthcare, is a data-driven infrastructure that highly relies on smart sensing
devices (i.e., blood pressure monitors, temperature sensors, etc.) for faster
response time, treatments, and diagnosis. However, with the evolving cyber
threat landscape, IoT devices have become more vulnerable to the broader risk
surface (e.g., risks associated with generative AI, 5G-IoT, etc.), which, if
exploited, may lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of command
and control and potential harm. This paper reviews the fundamentals of
healthcare IoT, its privacy, and data security challenges associated with
machine learning and H-IoT devices. The paper further emphasizes the importance
of monitoring healthcare IoT layers such as perception, network, cloud, and
application. Detecting and responding to anomalies involves various
cyber-attacks and protocols such as Wi-Fi 6, Narrowband Internet of Things
(NB-IoT), Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, and 5G New Radio (5G NR). A robust
authentication mechanism based on machine learning and deep learning techniques
is required to protect and mitigate H-IoT devices from increasing cybersecurity
vulnerabilities. Hence, in this review paper, security and privacy challenges
and risk mitigation strategies for building resilience in H-IoT are explored
and reported.

<p class="mathjax">Graphs with heterophily have been regarded as challenging scenarios for Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), where nodes are connected with dissimilar neighbors
through various patterns. In this paper, we present theoretical understandings
of the impacts of different heterophily patterns for GNNs by incorporating the
graph convolution (GC) operations into fully connected networks via the
proposed Heterophilous Stochastic Block Models (HSBM), a general random graph
model that can accommodate diverse heterophily patterns. Firstly, we show that
by applying a GC operation, the separability gains are determined by two
factors, i.e., the Euclidean distance of the neighborhood distributions and
$\sqrt{\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]}$, where
$\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]$ is the averaged node degree. It
reveals that the impact of heterophily on classification needs to be evaluated
alongside the averaged node degree. Secondly, we show that the topological
noise has a detrimental impact on separability, which is equivalent to
degrading $\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]$. Finally, when applying
multiple GC operations, we show that the separability gains are determined by
the normalized distance of the $l$-powered neighborhood distributions. It
indicates that the nodes still possess separability as $l$ goes to infinity in
a wide range of regimes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
data verify the effectiveness of our theory.

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing an object from photos and placing it virtually in a new
environment goes beyond the standard novel view synthesis task as the
appearance of the object has to not only adapt to the novel viewpoint but also
to the new lighting conditions and yet evaluations of inverse rendering methods
rely on novel view synthesis data or simplistic synthetic datasets for
quantitative analysis. This work presents a real-world dataset for measuring
the reconstruction and rendering of objects for relighting. To this end, we
capture the environment lighting and ground truth images of the same objects in
multiple environments allowing to reconstruct the objects from images taken in
one environment and quantify the quality of the rendered views for the unseen
lighting environments. Further, we introduce a simple baseline composed of
off-the-shelf methods and test several state-of-the-art methods on the
relighting task and show that novel view synthesis is not a reliable proxy to
measure performance. Code and dataset are available at

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the need for increased spectral efficiency and the proliferation
of intelligent applications, the sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is
anticipated to integrate the dual-functions of communication and sensing (C&amp;S).
Although the millimeter wave (mmWave) communication and mmWave radar share
similar multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture for integration, the
full potential of dual-function synergy remains to be exploited. In this paper,
we commence by overviewing state-of-the-art schemes from the aspects of
waveform design and signal processing. Nevertheless, these approaches face the
dilemma of mutual compromise between C&amp;S performance. To this end, we reveal
and exploit the synergy between C&amp;S. In the proposed framework, we introduce a
two-stage frame structure and resort artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve
the synergistic gain by designing a joint C&amp;S channel semantic extraction and
reconstruction network (JCASCasterNet). With just a cost-effective and
energy-efficient single sensing antenna, the proposed scheme achieves enhanced
overall performance while requiring only limited pilot and feedback signaling
overhead. In the end, we outline the challenges that lie ahead in the future
development of integrated sensing and communication networks, along with
promising directions for further research.

<p class="mathjax">The optimal one-sided parametric polynomial approximants of a circular arc
are considered. More precisely, the approximant must be entirely in or out of
the underlying circle of an arc. The natural restriction to an arc's
approximants interpolating boundary points is assumed. However, the study of
approximants, which additionally interpolate corresponding tangent directions
and curvatures at the boundary of an arc, is also considered. Several
low-degree polynomial approximants are studied in detail. When several
solutions fulfilling the interpolation conditions exist, the optimal one is
characterized, and a numerical algorithm for its construction is suggested.
Theoretical results are demonstrated with several numerical examples and a
comparison with general (i.e. non-one-sided) approximants are provided.

<p class="mathjax">Rehabilitation tasks demand robust and accurate trajectory-tracking
performance, mainly achieved with parallel robots. In this field, limiting the
value of the force exerted on the patient is crucial, especially when an
injured limb is involved. In human-robot interaction studies, the admittance
controller modifies the location of the robot according to the user efforts
driving the end-effector to an arbitrary location within the workspace.
However, a parallel robot has singularities within the workspace, making
implementing a conventional admittance controller unsafe. Thus, this study
proposes an admittance controller that overcomes the limitations of singular
configurations by using a real-time singularity avoidance algorithm. The
singularity avoidance algorithm modifies the original trajectory based on the
actual location of the parallel robot. The complemented admittance controller
is applied to a 4 degrees of freedom parallel robot for knee rehabilitation. In
this case, the actual location is measured by a 3D tracking system because the
location calculated by the forward kinematics is inaccurate in the vicinity of
a singularity. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed admittance controller for safe knee rehabilitation exercises

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing real-world objects and estimating their movable joint
structures are pivotal technologies within the field of robotics. Previous
research has predominantly focused on supervised approaches, relying on
extensively annotated datasets to model articulated objects within limited
categories. However, this approach falls short of effectively addressing the
diversity present in the real world. To tackle this issue, we propose a
self-supervised interaction perception method, referred to as SM$^3$, which
leverages multi-view RGB images captured before and after interaction to model
articulated objects, identify the movable parts, and infer the parameters of
their rotating joints. By constructing 3D geometries and textures from the
captured 2D images, SM$^3$ achieves integrated optimization of movable part and
joint parameters during the reconstruction process, obviating the need for
annotations. Furthermore, we introduce the MMArt dataset, an extension of
PartNet-Mobility, encompassing multi-view and multi-modal data of articulated
objects spanning diverse categories. Evaluations demonstrate that SM$^3$
surpasses existing benchmarks across various categories and objects, while its
adaptability in real-world scenarios has been thoroughly validated.

<p class="mathjax">Local stochastic gradient descent (Local-SGD), also referred to as federated
averaging, is an approach to distributed optimization where each device
performs more than one SGD update per communication. This work presents an
empirical study of {\it asynchronous} Local-SGD for training language models;
that is, each worker updates the global parameters as soon as it has finished
its SGD steps. We conduct a comprehensive investigation by examining how worker
hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer could
impact the learning performance. We find that with naive implementations,
asynchronous Local-SGD takes more iterations to converge than its synchronous
counterpart despite updating the (global) model parameters more frequently. We
identify momentum acceleration on the global parameters when worker gradients
are stale as a key challenge. We propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed
Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on
their computation speed. This approach, evaluated with models up to 150M
parameters on the C4 dataset, matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD
in terms of perplexity per update step, and significantly surpasses it in terms
of wall clock time.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-perspective cameras with potentially non-overlapping fields of view
have become an important exteroceptive sensing modality in a number of
applications such as intelligent vehicles, drones, and mixed reality headsets.
In this work, we challenge one of the basic assumptions made in these
scenarios, which is that the multi-camera rig is rigid. More specifically, we
are considering the problem of estimating the relative pose between a static
non-rigid rig in different spatial orientations while taking into account the
effect of gravity onto the system. The deformable physical connections between
each camera and the body center are approximated by a simple cantilever model,
and inserted into the generalized epipolar constraint. Our results lead us to
the important insight that the latent parameters of the deformation model,
meaning the gravity vector in both views, become observable. We present a
concise analysis of the observability of all variables based on noise,
outliers, and rig rigidity for two different algorithms. The first one is a
vision-only alternative, while the second one makes use of additional gravity
measurements. To conclude, we demonstrate the ability to sense gravity in a
real-world example, and discuss practical implications.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal emotion recognition techniques are increasingly essential for
assessing mental states. Image-based methods, however, tend to focus
predominantly on overt visual cues and often overlook subtler mental state
changes. Psychophysiological research has demonstrated that HR and skin
temperature are effective in detecting ANS activities, thereby revealing these
subtle changes. However, traditional HR tools are generally more costly and
less portable, while skin temperature analysis usually necessitates extensive
manual processing. Advances in remote-PPG and automatic thermal ROI detection
algorithms have been developed to address these issues, yet their accuracy in
practical applications remains limited. This study aims to bridge this gap by
integrating r-PPG with thermal imaging to enhance prediction performance.
Ninety participants completed a 20-minute questionnaire to induce cognitive
stress, followed by watching a film aimed at eliciting moral elevation. The
results demonstrate that the combination of r-PPG and thermal imaging
effectively detects emotional shifts. Using r-PPG alone, the prediction
accuracy was 77% for cognitive stress and 61% for moral elevation, as
determined by SVM. Thermal imaging alone achieved 79% accuracy for cognitive
stress and 78% for moral elevation, utilizing a RF algorithm. An early fusion
strategy of these modalities significantly improved accuracies, achieving 87%
for cognitive stress and 83% for moral elevation using RF. Further analysis,
which utilized statistical metrics and explainable machine learning methods
including SHAP, highlighted key features and clarified the relationship between
cardiac responses and facial temperature variations. Notably, it was observed
that cardiovascular features derived from r-PPG models had a more pronounced
influence in data fusion, despite thermal imaging's higher predictive accuracy
in unimodal analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Image animation aims to bring static images to life according to driving
videos and create engaging visual content that can be used for various purposes
such as animation, entertainment, and education. Recent unsupervised methods
utilize affine and thin-plate spline transformations based on keypoints to
transfer the motion in driving frames to the source image. However, limited by
the expressive power of the transformations used, these methods always produce
poor results when the gap between the motion in the driving frame and the
source image is large. To address this issue, we propose to model motion from
the source image to the driving frame in highly-expressive diffeomorphism
spaces. Firstly, we introduce Continuous Piecewise-Affine based (CPAB)
transformation to model the motion and present a well-designed inference
algorithm to generate CPAB transformation from control keypoints. Secondly, we
propose a SAM-guided keypoint semantic loss to further constrain the keypoint
extraction process and improve the semantic consistency between the
corresponding keypoints on the source and driving images. Finally, we design a
structure alignment loss to align the structure-related features extracted from
driving and generated images, thus helping the generator generate results that
are more consistent with the driving action. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against state-of-the-art
competitors quantitatively and qualitatively. Code will be publicly available

fundamentally new applications we use every day. Existing methods for
long-sequence LLM training are neither efficient nor compatible with
commonly-used training algorithms such as FlashAttention. We design Buff to
address these issues. Buff decouples all of the sharding dimensions into a new
hierarchical space, and systematically analyzes the memory and communication
cost of LLM training. Then, it generates an effective hybrid parallelism
strategy. We design a new selective overlap mechanism to mitigate the

<p class="mathjax">In the contemporary information era, significantly accelerated by the advent
of Large-scale Language Models, the proliferation of scientific literature is
reaching unprecedented levels. Researchers urgently require efficient tools for
reading and summarizing academic papers, uncovering significant scientific
literature, and employing diverse interpretative methodologies. To address this
burgeoning demand, the role of automated scientific literature interpretation
systems has become paramount. However, prevailing models, both commercial and
open-source, confront notable challenges: they often overlook multimodal data,
grapple with summarizing over-length texts, and lack diverse user interfaces.
In response, we introduce an open-source multi-modal automated academic paper
interpretation system (MMAPIS) with three-step process stages, incorporating
LLMs to augment its functionality. Our system first employs the hybrid modality
preprocessing and alignment module to extract plain text, and tables or figures
from documents separately. It then aligns this information based on the section
names they belong to, ensuring that data with identical section names are

discourse-aware summarization method. It utilizes the extracted section names
to divide the article into shorter text segments, facilitating specific
summarizations both within and between sections via LLMs with specific prompts.
Finally, we have designed four types of diversified user interfaces, including
paper recommendation, multimodal Q\&amp;A, audio broadcasting, and interpretation
blog, which can be widely applied across various scenarios. Our qualitative and
quantitative evaluations underscore the system's superiority, especially in
scientific summarization, where it outperforms solutions relying solely on
GPT-4.

<p class="mathjax">Unreliable feature extraction and matching in handcrafted features undermine
the performance of visual SLAM in complex real-world scenarios. While learned
local features, leveraging CNNs, demonstrate proficiency in capturing
high-level information and excel in matching benchmarks, they encounter
challenges in continuous motion scenes, resulting in poor generalization and
impacting loop detection accuracy. To address these issues, we present DK-SLAM,
a monocular visual SLAM system with adaptive deep local features. MAML
optimizes the training of these features, and we introduce a coarse-to-fine
feature tracking approach. Initially, a direct method approximates the relative
pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for
refined pose estimation. To counter cumulative positioning errors, a novel
online learning binary feature-based online loop closure module identifies loop
nodes within a sequence. Experimental results underscore DK-SLAM's efficacy,
outperforms representative SLAM solutions, such as ORB-SLAM3 on publicly
available datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The progress introduced by pre-trained language models and their fine-tuning
has resulted in significant improvements in most downstream NLP tasks. The
unsupervised training of a language model combined with further target task
fine-tuning has become the standard QA fine-tuning procedure. In this work, we
demonstrate that this strategy is sub-optimal for fine-tuning QA models,
especially under a low QA annotation budget, which is a usual setting in
practice due to the extractive QA labeling cost. We draw our conclusions by
conducting an exhaustive analysis of the performance of the alternatives of the
sequential fine-tuning strategy on different QA datasets. Based on the
experiments performed, we observed that the best strategy to fine-tune the QA
model in low-budget settings is taking a pre-trained language model (PLM) and
then fine-tuning PLM with a dataset composed of the target dataset and SQuAD
dataset. With zero extra annotation effort, the best strategy outperforms the
standard strategy by 2.28% to 6.48%. Our experiments provide one of the first
investigations on how to best fine-tune a QA system under a low budget and are
therefore of the utmost practical interest to the QA practitioners.

<p class="mathjax">Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) has revolutionized the field of cancer
treatment in the era of precision medicine due to their ability to precisely
target cancer cells and release highly effective drug. Nevertheless, the
realization of rational design of ADC is very difficult because the
relationship between their structures and activities is difficult to
understand. In the present study, we introduce a unified deep learning
framework called ADCNet to help design potential ADCs. The ADCNet highly
integrates the protein representation learning language model ESM-2 and
small-molecule representation learning language model FG-BERT models to achieve
activity prediction through learning meaningful features from antigen and
antibody protein sequences of ADC, SMILES strings of linker and payload, and
drug-antibody ratio (DAR) value. Based on a carefully designed and manually
tailored ADC data set, extensive evaluation results reveal that ADCNet performs
best on the test set compared to baseline machine learning models across all
evaluation metrics. For example, it achieves an average prediction accuracy of
87.12%, a balanced accuracy of 0.8689, and an area under receiver operating
characteristic curve of 0.9293 on the test set. In addition, cross-validation,
ablation experiments, and external independent testing results further prove
the stability, advancement, and robustness of the ADCNet architecture. For the
convenience of the community, we develop the first online platform
(https://ADCNet.idruglab.cn) for the prediction of ADCs activity based on the
optimal ADCNet model, and the source code is publicly available at
https://github.com/idrugLab/ADCNet.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Multiple Domain Translation is the task of transforming data
from one domain to other domains without having paired data to train the
systems. Typically, methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
used to address this task. However, our proposal exclusively relies on a
modified version of a Variational Autoencoder. This modification consists of
the use of two latent variables disentangled in a controlled way by design. One
of this latent variables is imposed to depend exclusively on the domain, while
the other one must depend on the rest of the variability factors of the data.
Additionally, the conditions imposed over the domain latent variable allow for
better control and understanding of the latent space. We empirically
demonstrate that our approach works on different vision datasets improving the
performance of other well known methods. Finally, we prove that, indeed, one of
the latent variables stores all the information related to the domain and the
other one hardly contains any domain information.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to meet continuously emerging requirements without
expensive retraining. MCIT faces two major obstacles: catastrophic forgetting
(where old knowledge is forgotten) and negative forward transfer (where the
performance of future tasks is degraded). Although existing methods have
greatly alleviated catastrophic forgetting, they still suffer from negative
forward transfer. By performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on input
embeddings, we discover a large discrepancy in different input embeddings. The
discrepancy results in the model learning irrelevant information for old and
pre-trained tasks, which leads to catastrophic forgetting and negative forward
transfer. To address these issues, we propose Fwd-Prompt, a prompt-based method
projecting prompt gradient to the residual space to minimize the interference
between tasks and to the pre-trained subspace for reusing pre-trained
knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that Fwd-Prompt achieves
state-of-the-art performance while updating fewer parameters and requiring no
old samples. Our research sheds light on the potential of continuously adapting
MLLMs to new tasks under the instruction tuning paradigm and encourages future
studies to explore MCIT. The code will soon be publicly available.

BTs nicely express control, data handling aspects so far must be provided

are faced with a bewildering choice of mechanisms which tend to boil down to
monolithic proprietary closed-source Vendor solutions. We introduce The Mikado
Filesystem (mikfs), which provides an open simple lightweight interoperable
portable extensible remote filesystem that is open source. mikfs consists of
client applications accessing remote servers via RPC running over TCP/IP
connections. mikfs is defined as a concrete set of API method calls over gRPC
expressed in Google's Protocol Buffers' IDL. gRPC supports a wide variety of
programming languages &amp; platforms. For a given language + platform, the gRPC
toolset can generate client- &amp; server-side stubs from the IDL callable from
client &amp; server code in the selected languages, e.g., a client written in C# or
java running on a Windows PC can access a server written in C++ running on
Linux. mikfs consists of a virtual hierarchical tree of files &amp; directories.
This logical filesystem is not constrained to the limits and file naming
conventions of the host's own physical native filesystem. API methods are
provided for authentication; for atomic file-level operations on files &amp;
directories; for clients to register to receive notifications of file &amp;
directory changes on a server. The public API allows developers to write their
own new servers and clients; allowing migration of hosted files between
different implementations; extension with new methods &amp; features; is Open
Source code available for inspection and adaptation. gRPC provides secure
authenticated connection &amp; communication over HTTP/2; End-to-End Privacy &amp;
Security against eavesdropping of data in transit; support for multiple
alternate user login mechanisms. mikfs is provided as source code, 'The
Bootstrap Distribution', consisting of an ecosystem of clients, servers, tools
and utilities.

<p class="mathjax">In the field of dentistry, there is a growing demand for increased precision
in diagnostic tools, with a specific focus on advanced imaging techniques such
as computed tomography, cone beam computed tomography, magnetic resonance
imaging, ultrasound, and traditional intra-oral periapical X-rays. Deep
learning has emerged as a pivotal tool in this context, enabling the
implementation of automated segmentation techniques crucial for extracting
essential diagnostic data. This integration of cutting-edge technology
addresses the urgent need for effective management of dental conditions, which,
if left undetected, can have a significant impact on human health. The
impressive track record of deep learning across various domains, including
dentistry, underscores its potential to revolutionize early detection and
treatment of oral health issues. Objective: Having demonstrated significant
results in diagnosis and prediction, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
represent an emerging field of multidisciplinary research. The goals of this
study were to provide a concise overview of the state of the art, standardize
the current debate, and establish baselines for future research. Method: In
this study, a systematic literature review is employed as a methodology to
identify and select relevant studies that specifically investigate the deep
learning technique for dental imaging analysis. This study elucidates the
methodological approach, including the systematic collection of data,
statistical analysis, and subsequent dissemination of outcomes. Conclusion:
This work demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be employed
to analyze images, serving as effective tools for detecting dental pathologies.
Although this research acknowledged some limitations, CNNs utilized for
segmenting and categorizing teeth exhibited their highest level of performance
overall.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the success of deep learning-based algorithms, it is widely known
that neural networks may fail to be robust. A popular paradigm to enforce
robustness is adversarial training (AT), however, this introduces many
computational and theoretical difficulties. Recent works have developed a
connection between AT in the multiclass classification setting and
multimarginal optimal transport (MOT), unlocking a new set of tools to study
this problem. In this paper, we leverage the MOT connection to propose
computationally tractable numerical algorithms for computing universal lower
bounds on the optimal adversarial risk and identifying optimal classifiers. We
propose two main algorithms based on linear programming (LP) and entropic
regularization (Sinkhorn). Our key insight is that one can harmlessly truncate
the higher order interactions between classes, preventing the combinatorial run
times typically encountered in MOT problems. We validate these results with
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-$10$, which demonstrate the tractability of our
approach.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid progress of Transformers in artificial intelligence has come at the
cost of increased resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions due to
growing model sizes. Prior work suggests using pretrained small models to
improve training efficiency, but this approach may not be suitable for new
model structures. On the other hand, training from scratch can be slow, and
progressively stacking layers often fails to achieve significant acceleration.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Apollo, which
prep\textbf{a}res lessons for ex\textbf{p}anding \textbf{o}perations by
\textbf{l}earning high-\textbf{l}ayer functi\textbf{o}nality during training of
low layers. Our approach involves low-value-prioritized sampling (LVPS) to
train different depths and weight sharing to facilitate efficient expansion. We
also introduce an interpolation method for stable model depth extension.
Experiments demonstrate that Apollo achieves state-of-the-art acceleration
ratios, even rivaling methods using pretrained models, making it a universal
and efficient solution for training deep models while reducing time, financial,
and environmental costs.

<p class="mathjax">Graph neural networks are increasingly becoming the framework of choice for
graph-based machine learning. In this paper, we propose a new graph neural
network architecture that substitutes classical message passing with an
analysis of the local distribution of node features. To this end, we extract
the distribution of features in the egonet for each local neighbourhood and
compare them against a set of learned label distributions by taking the
histogram intersection kernel. The similarity information is then propagated to
other nodes in the network, effectively creating a message passing-like
mechanism where the message is determined by the ensemble of the features. We
perform an ablation study to evaluate the network's performance under different
choices of its hyper-parameters. Finally, we test our model on standard graph
classification and regression benchmarks, and we find that it outperforms
widely used alternative approaches, including both graph kernels and graph
neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">The video composition task aims to integrate specified foregrounds and
backgrounds from different videos into a harmonious composite. Current
approaches, predominantly trained on videos with adjusted foreground color and
lighting, struggle to address deep semantic disparities beyond superficial
adjustments, such as domain gaps. Therefore, we propose a training-free
pipeline employing a pre-trained diffusion model imbued with semantic prior
knowledge, which can process composite videos with broader semantic
disparities. Specifically, we process the video frames in a cascading manner
and handle each frame in two processes with the diffusion model. In the
inversion process, we propose Balanced Partial Inversion to obtain generation
initial points that balance reversibility and modifiability. Then, in the
generation process, we further propose Inter-Frame Augmented attention to
augment foreground continuity across frames. Experimental results reveal that
our pipeline successfully ensures the visual harmony and inter-frame coherence
of the outputs, demonstrating efficacy in managing broader semantic
disparities.

<p class="mathjax">Modern techniques for physical simulations rely on numerical schemes and
mesh-refinement methods to address trade-offs between precision and complexity,
but these handcrafted solutions are tedious and require high computational
power. Data-driven methods based on large-scale machine learning promise high
adaptivity by integrating long-range dependencies more directly and
efficiently. In this work, we focus on fluid dynamics and address the
shortcomings of a large part of the literature, which are based on fixed
support for computations and predictions in the form of regular or irregular
grids. We propose a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial
and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations. We formulate
the task as a double observation problem and propose a solution with two
interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions
and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution
from the initial condition. Our practical implementation involves recurrent
GNNs and a spatio-temporal attention observer capable of interpolating the
solution at arbitrary locations. Our model not only generalizes to new initial
conditions (as standard auto-regressive models do) but also performs evaluation
at arbitrary space and time locations. We evaluate on three standard datasets
in fluid dynamics and compare to strong baselines, which are outperformed both
in classical settings and in the extended new task requiring continuous
predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional data monetization approaches face challenges related to data
protection and logistics. In response, digital data marketplaces have emerged
as intermediaries simplifying data transactions. Despite the growing
establishment and acceptance of digital data marketplaces, significant
challenges hinder efficient data trading. As a result, few companies can derive
tangible value from their data, leading to missed opportunities in
understanding customers, pricing decisions, and fraud prevention. In this
paper, we explore both technical and organizational challenges affecting data
monetization. Moreover, we identify areas in need of further research, aiming
to expand the boundaries of current knowledge by emphasizing where research is
currently limited or lacking.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of real-time lyrics alignment is to take live singing audio as input
and to pinpoint the exact position within given lyrics on the fly. The task can
benefit real-world applications such as the automatic subtitling of live
concerts or operas. However, designing a real-time model poses a great
challenge due to the constraints of only using past input and operating within
a minimal latency. Furthermore, due to the lack of datasets for real-time
models for lyrics alignment, previous studies have mostly evaluated with
private in-house datasets, resulting in a lack of standard evaluation methods.
This paper presents a real-time lyrics alignment system for classical vocal
performances with two contributions. First, we improve the lyrics alignment
algorithm by finding an optimal combination of chromagram and phonetic
posteriorgram (PPG) that capture melodic and phonetics features of the singing
voice, respectively. Second, we recast the Schubert Winterreise Dataset (SWD)
which contains multiple performance renditions of the same pieces as an
evaluation set for the real-time lyrics alignment.

<p class="mathjax">Only the chairs can edit In the fight against cyber attacks, Network
Softwarization (NS) is a flexible and adaptable shield, using advanced software
to spot malicious activity in regular network traffic. However, the
availability of comprehensive datasets for mobile networks, which are
fundamental for the development of Machine Learning (ML) solutions for attack
detection near their source, is still limited. Cross-Domain Artificial
Intelligence (AI) can be the key to address this, although its application in
Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is still at its infancy. To address these
challenges, we deployed an end-to-end O-RAN network, that was used to collect
data from the RAN and the transport network. These datasets allow us to combine
the knowledge from an in-network ML traffic classifier for attack detection to
bolster the training of an ML-based traffic classifier specifically tailored
for the RAN. Our results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach,
achieving an accuracy rate of 93%. This approach not only bridges critical gaps
in mobile network security but also showcases the potential of cross-domain AI
in enhancing the efficacy of network security measures.

<p class="mathjax">Content addressable memory is popular in the field of intelligent computing
systems with its searching nature. Emerging CAMs show a promising increase in
pixel density and a decrease in power consumption than pure CMOS solutions.
This article introduced an energy-efficient 3T1R1C TCAM cooperating with
capacitor dividers and RRAM devices. The RRAM as a storage element also acts as
a switch to the capacitor divider while searching for content. CAM cells
benefit from working parallel in an array structure. We implemented a 64 x 64
array and digital controllers to perform with an internal built-in clock
frequency of 875MHz. Both data searches and reads take 3x clock cycles. Its
worst average energy for data match is reported to be 1.71 fJ/bit-search and
the worst average energy for data miss is found with 4.69 fJ/bit-search. The
prototype is simulated and fabricated in 0.18 um technology with in-lab RRAM
post-processing. Such memory explores the charge domain searching mechanism and
can be applied to data centers that are power-hungry.

<p class="mathjax">Adversaries have been targeting unique identifiers to launch typo-squatting,
mobile app squatting and even voice squatting attacks. Anecdotal evidence
suggest that online social networks (OSNs) are also plagued with accounts that
use similar usernames. This can be confusing to users but can also be exploited
by adversaries. However, to date no study characterizes this problem on OSNs.
In this work, we define the username squatting problem and design the first
multi-faceted measurement study to characterize it on X. We develop a username
generation tool (UsernameCrazy) to help us analyze hundreds of thousands of
username variants derived from celebrity accounts. Our study reveals that
thousands of squatted usernames have been suspended by X, while tens of
thousands that still exist on the network are likely bots. Out of these, a
large number share similar profile pictures and profile names to the original
account signalling impersonation attempts. We found that squatted accounts are
being mentioned by mistake in tweets hundreds of thousands of times and are
even being prioritized in searches by the network's search recommendation
algorithm exacerbating the negative impact squatted accounts can have in OSNs.
We use our insights and take the first step to address this issue by designing
a framework (SQUAD) that combines UsernameCrazy with a new classifier to
efficiently detect suspicious squatted accounts. Our evaluation of SQUAD's
prototype implementation shows that it can achieve 94% F1-score when trained on
a small dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Narratives can be powerful tools for inspiring action on pressing societal
issues such as climate change. While social science theories offer frameworks
for understanding the narratives that arise within collective movements, these
are rarely applied to the vast data available from social media platforms,
which play a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing
collective action. This gap in the empirical evaluation of online narratives
limits our understanding of their relationship with public response. In this
study, we focus on plant-based diets as a form of pro-environmental action and
employ natural language processing to operationalize a theoretical framework of
moral narratives specific to the vegan movement. We apply this framework to
narratives found in YouTube videos promoting environmental initiatives such as
Veganuary, Meatless March, and No Meat May. Our analysis reveals that several
narrative types, as defined by the theory, are empirically present in the data.
To identify narratives with the potential to elicit positive public engagement,
we used text processing to estimate the proportion of comments supporting
collective action across narrative types. Video narratives advocating social
fight, whether through protest or through efforts to convert others to the
cause, are associated with a stronger sense of collective action in the
respective comments. These narrative types also demonstrate increased semantic
coherence and alignment between the message and public response, markers
typically associated with successful collective action. Our work offers new
insights into the complex factors that influence the emergence of collective
action, thereby informing the development of effective communication strategies
within social movements.

used as equalizers for bandlimited channels with a memoryless nonlinearity. The
NN-equalizers are combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to
approach the information rates of joint detection and decoding (JDD) with
considerably less complexity than JDD and other existing equalizers.
Simulations for short-haul optical fiber links with square-law detection

<p class="mathjax">Existing methods for Visual Information Extraction (VIE) from form-like
documents typically fragment the process into separate subtasks, such as key
information extraction, key-value pair extraction, and choice group extraction.
However, these approaches often overlook the hierarchical structure of form
documents, including hierarchical key-value pairs and hierarchical choice
groups. To address these limitations, we present a new perspective, reframing
VIE as a relation prediction problem and unifying labels of different tasks
into a single label space. This unified approach allows for the definition of
various relation types and effectively tackles hierarchical relationships in
form-like documents. In line with this perspective, we present UniVIE, a
unified model that addresses the VIE problem comprehensively. UniVIE functions
using a coarse-to-fine strategy. It initially generates tree proposals through
a tree proposal network, which are subsequently refined into hierarchical trees
by a relation decoder module. To enhance the relation prediction capabilities
of UniVIE, we incorporate two novel tree constraints into the relation decoder:
a tree attention mask and a tree level embedding. Extensive experimental
evaluations on both our in-house dataset HierForms and a publicly available
dataset SIBR, substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results,
underscoring the effectiveness and potential of our unified approach in
advancing the field of VIE.

<p class="mathjax">Using well-known mathematical problems for encryption is a widely used
technique because they are computationally hard and provide security against
potential attacks on the encryption method. The subset sum problem (SSP) can be
defined as finding a subset of integers from a given set, whose sum is equal to
a specified integer. The classic SSP has various variants, one of which is the
multiple-subset problem (MSSP). In the MSSP, the goal is to select items from a
given set and distribute them among multiple bins, en-suring that the capacity
of each bin is not exceeded while maximizing the total weight of the selected
items. This approach addresses a related problem with a different perspective.
Here a related different kind of problem is approached: given a set of sets
A={A1, A2..., An}, find an integer s for which every subset of the given sets
is summed up to, if such an integer exists. The problem is NP-complete when
considering it as a variant of SSP. However, there exists an algorithm that is
relatively efficient for known pri-vate keys. This algorithm is based on
dispensing non-relevant values of the potential sums. In this paper we present
the encryption scheme based on MSSP and present its novel usage and
implementation in communication.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new way of looking at local optima networks (LONs). LONs
represent fitness landscapes; the nodes are local optima, and the edges are
search transitions between them. Many metrics computed on LONs have been
proposed and shown to be linked to metaheuristic search difficulty. These have
typically considered LONs as describing static structures. In contrast to this,
Laplacian dynamics (LD) is an approach to consider the information flow across
a network as a dynamical process. We adapt and apply LD to the context of LONs.
As a testbed, we consider instances from the quadratic assignment problem (QAP)
library. Metrics related to LD are proposed and these are compared with
existing LON metrics. The results show that certain LD metrics are strong
predictors of metaheuristic performance for iterated local search and tabu
search.

<p class="mathjax">The great demand for real-time multimedia sessions encompassing groups of
users (multi-user), associated with the limitations of the current Internet in
providing quality assurance, has raised challenges for defining the best
mechanisms to deploy the Next Generation of Networks (NGN). There is a
consensus that an efficient and scalable provisioning of network resources is
crucial for the success of the NGN, mainly in what concerns access networks.
Previous solutions for the control of multi-user sessions rely mostly on
uncoordinated actions to allocate per-flow bandwidth and multicast trees. This
paper introduces a Multiuser Aggregated Resource Allocation mechanism (MARA)
that coordinates the control of class-based bandwidth and multicast resources
in a scalable manner. In comparison with previous work, MARA significantly
reduces signaling, state and processing overhead. The performance benefits of
MARA are analyzed though simulations, which successfully demonstrated the
significant optimization in the network performance.

<p class="mathjax">Contextual Text Block Detection (CTBD) is the task of identifying coherent
text blocks within the complexity of natural scenes. Previous methodologies
have treated CTBD as either a visual relation extraction challenge within
computer vision or as a sequence modeling problem from the perspective of
natural language processing. We introduce a new framework that frames CTBD as a
graph generation problem. This methodology consists of two essential
procedures: identifying individual text units as graph nodes and discerning the
sequential reading order relationships among these units as graph edges.
Leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of DQ-DETR for node detection, our
framework innovates further by integrating a novel mechanism, a Dynamic
Relation Transformer (DRFormer), dedicated to edge generation. DRFormer
incorporates a dual interactive transformer decoder that deftly manages a
dynamic graph structure refinement process. Through this iterative process, the
model systematically enhances the graph's fidelity, ultimately resulting in
improved precision in detecting contextual text blocks. Comprehensive
experimental evaluations conducted on both SCUT-CTW-Context and ReCTS-Context
datasets substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results,
underscoring the effectiveness and potential of our graph generation framework
in advancing the field of CTBD.

<p class="mathjax">SARRIGUREN, a new complete algorithm for SAT based on counting clauses (which
is valid also for Unique-SAT and #SAT) is described, analyzed and tested.
Although existing complete algorithms for SAT perform slower with clauses with
many literals, that is an advantage for SARRIGUREN, because the more literals
are in the clauses the bigger is the probability of overlapping among clauses,
a property that makes the clause counting process more efficient. Actually, it
provides a $O(m^2 \times n/k)$ time complexity for random $k$-SAT instances of
$n$ variables and $m$ relatively dense clauses, where that density level is
relative to the number of variables $n$, that is, clauses are relatively dense
when $k\geq7\sqrt{n}$. Although theoretically there could be worst-cases with
exponential complexity, the probability of those cases to happen in random
$k$-SAT with relatively dense clauses is practically zero. The algorithm has
been empirically tested and that polynomial time complexity maintains also for
$k$-SAT instances with less dense clauses ($k\geq5\sqrt{n}$). That density
could, for example, be of only 0.049 working with $n=20000$ variables and
$k=989$ literals. In addition, they are presented two more complementary
algorithms that provide the solutions to $k$-SAT instances and valuable
information about number of solutions for each literal. Although this algorithm
does not solve the NP=P problem (it is not a polynomial algorithm for 3-SAT),
it broads the knowledge about that subject, because $k$-SAT with $k&gt;3$ and
dense clauses is not harder than 3-SAT. Moreover, the Python implementation of
the algorithms, and all the input datasets and obtained results in the
experiments are made available.

<p class="mathjax">Equivariant neural networks have shown improved performance, expressiveness
and sample complexity on symmetrical domains. But for some specific symmetries,
representations, and choice of coordinates, the most common point-wise
activations, such as ReLU, are not equivariant, hence they cannot be employed
in the design of equivariant neural networks. The theorem we present in this
paper describes all possible combinations of finite-dimensional
representations, choice of coordinates and point-wise activations to obtain an
exactly equivariant layer, generalizing and strengthening existing
characterizations. Notable cases of practical relevance are discussed as
corollaries. Indeed, we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be
invariant, as it happens for any network which is equivariant with respect to
connected compact groups. Then, we discuss implications of our findings when
applied to important instances of exactly equivariant networks. First, we
completely characterize permutation equivariant networks such as Invariant
Graph Networks with point-wise nonlinearities and their geometric counterparts,
highlighting a plethora of models whose expressive power and performance are
still unknown. Second, we show that feature spaces of disentangled steerable
convolutional neural networks are trivial representations.

<p class="mathjax">Predictive coding-inspired deep networks for visual computing integrate
classification and reconstruction processes in shared intermediate layers.
Although synergy between these processes is commonly assumed, it has yet to be
convincingly demonstrated. In this study, we take a critical look at how
classifying and reconstructing interact in deep learning architectures. Our
approach utilizes a purposefully designed family of model architectures
reminiscent of autoencoders, each equipped with an encoder, a decoder, and a
classification head featuring varying modules and complexities. We meticulously
analyze the extent to which classification- and reconstruction-driven
information can seamlessly coexist within the shared latent layer of the model
architectures. Our findings underscore a significant challenge:
Classification-driven information diminishes reconstruction-driven information
in intermediate layers' shared representations and vice versa. While expanding
the shared representation's dimensions or increasing the network's complexity
can alleviate this trade-off effect, our results challenge prevailing
assumptions in predictive coding and offer guidance for future iterations of
predictive coding concepts in deep networks.

<p class="mathjax">Precisely determining the contact force during safe interaction in Minimally
Invasive Robotic Surgery (MIRS) is still an open research challenge. Inspired
by post-operative qualitative analysis from surgical videos, the use of
cross-modality data driven deep neural network models has been one of the
newest approaches to predict sensorless force trends. However, these methods
required for large and variable datasets which are not currently available. In
this paper, we present a new vision-haptic dataset (DaFoEs) with variable soft
environments for the training of deep neural models. In order to reduce the
bias from a single dataset, we present a pipeline to generalize different
vision and state data inputs for mixed dataset training, using a previously
validated dataset with different setup. Finally, we present a variable
encoder-decoder architecture to predict the forces done by the laparoscopic
tool using single input or sequence of inputs. For input sequence, we use a
recurrent decoder, named with the prefix R, and a new temporal sampling to
represent the acceleration of the tool. During our training, we demonstrate
that single dataset training tends to overfit to the training data domain, but
has difficulties on translating the results across new domains. However,
dataset mixing presents a good translation with a mean relative estimated force
error of 5% and 12% for the recurrent and non-recurrent models respectively.
Our method, also marginally increase the effectiveness of transformers for
force estimation up to a maximum of ~15%, as the volume of available data is
increase by 150%. In conclusion, we demonstrate that mixing experimental set
ups for vision-state force estimation in MIRS is a possible approach towards
the general solution of the problem.

<p class="mathjax">In our digital world, access to personal and public data has become an item
of concern, with challenging security and privacy aspects. Modern information
systems are heterogeneous in nature and have an inherent security
vulnerability, which is susceptible to data interception and data modification
due to unsecured communication data pipelines between connected endpoints. This
re-search article presents a blockchain-based model for securing data pipelines
in a heterogeneous information system using an integrated multi-hazard early

inherent security features of blockchain technology to address the security and
privacy concerns that arise in data pipelines. The model is designed to ensure
data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity in a decentralized manner.
The model is evaluated in a hybrid environment using a prototype implementation

traditional approaches for a tamper-proof and immutable data pipeline for data
authenticity and integrity using a confidential ledger.

<p class="mathjax">Motion planning for autonomous robots in human-populated environments poses
numerous challenges due to uncertainties in the robot's dynamics, environment,
and interaction with other agents. Sampling-based MPC approaches, such as Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have shown promise in addressing these
complex motion planning problems. However, the performance of MPPI heavily
relies on the choice of the sampling distribution. Existing literature often
uses the previously computed input sequence as the mean of a Gaussian
distribution for sampling, leading to potential failures and local minima. In
this paper, we propose novel derivations of the MPPI method to enhance its
efficiency, robustness, and convergence. Our approach includes a mathematical
formulation allowing for arbitrary sampling distributions, addressing numerical
issues, and alleviating the problem of local minima. We present an efficient
importance sampling scheme that combines classical and learning-based ancillary
controllers simultaneously, resulting in more informative sampling and control
fusion. We demonstrate our proposed scheme's superior efficiency and robustness
through experiments by handling model uncertainties, rapid environmental
changes and reducing susceptibility to local minima.

<p class="mathjax">V2X communications are nowadays performed at 5.9\,GHz spectrum, either using
WiFi-based or Cellular technology. The channel capacity is limited, and
congestion control regulates the number of messages that can enter the medium.
With user rate growing, overloading becomes a factor that might affect road
safety and traffic efficiency. The present paper evaluates the potential of
using Radar-Based Communication (RadCom) for offloading the V2X spectrum. We
consider a heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) platooning scenario as a case of maneuver
coordination where local messages are transmitted by means of RadCom at
different penetration rates. Simulations show significant improvements in
channel occupation and network reliability. As a result, RadCom allows for
shorter safe and energy efficient inter-vehicle distances.

<p class="mathjax">Robot learning tasks are extremely compute-intensive and hardware-specific.
Thus the avenues of tackling these challenges, using a diverse dataset of
offline demonstrations that can be used to train robot manipulation agents, is
very appealing. The Train-Offline-Test-Online (TOTO) Benchmark provides a
well-curated open-source dataset for offline training comprised mostly of
expert data and also benchmark scores of the common offline-RL and behaviour
cloning agents. In this paper, we introduce DiffClone, an offline algorithm of
enhanced behaviour cloning agent with diffusion-based policy learning, and
measured the efficacy of our method on real online physical robots at test
time. This is also our official submission to the Train-Offline-Test-Online
(TOTO) Benchmark Challenge organized at NeurIPS 2023. We experimented with both
pre-trained visual representation and agent policies. In our experiments, we
find that MOCO finetuned ResNet50 performs the best in comparison to other
finetuned representations. Goal state conditioning and mapping to transitions
resulted in a minute increase in the success rate and mean-reward. As for the
agent policy, we developed DiffClone, a behaviour cloning agent improved using
conditional diffusion.

<p class="mathjax">The growing prevalence and rapid evolution of offensive language in social
media amplify the complexities of detection, particularly highlighting the
challenges in identifying such content across diverse languages. This survey
presents a systematic and comprehensive exploration of Cross-Lingual Transfer
Learning (CLTL) techniques in offensive language detection in social media. Our
study stands as the first holistic overview to focus exclusively on the
cross-lingual scenario in this domain. We analyse 67 relevant papers and
categorise these studies across various dimensions, including the
characteristics of multilingual datasets used, the cross-lingual resources
employed, and the specific CLTL strategies implemented. According to "what to
transfer", we also summarise three main CLTL transfer approaches: instance,
feature, and parameter transfer. Additionally, we shed light on the current
challenges and future research opportunities in this field. Furthermore, we
have made our survey resources available online, including two comprehensive
tables that provide accessible references to the multilingual datasets and CLTL
methods used in the reviewed literature.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural network models for image segmentation can be a powerful tool for
the automation of motor claims handling processes in the insurance industry. A
crucial aspect is the reliability of the model outputs when facing adverse
conditions, such as low quality photos taken by claimants to document damages.
We explore the use of a meta-classification model to assess the precision of
segments predicted by a model trained for the semantic segmentation of car body
parts. Different sets of features correlated with the quality of a segment are
compared, and an AUROC score of 0.915 is achieved for distinguishing between
high- and low-quality segments. By removing low-quality segments, the average
mIoU of the segmentation output is improved by 16 percentage points and the
number of wrongly predicted segments is reduced by 77%.

on users accepting and enjoying using them. To achieve this, recently published
work in the field of Human-Computer Interaction suggests that the combination
of considering demographic information, user emotions and learning from the
implicit feedback in their utterances, is particularly important. However,
these findings have not yet been transferred to the field of Natural Language
Processing, where these data are primarily studied separately. Accordingly, no
sufficiently annotated dataset is available. To address this gap, we introduce
FEDI, the first English dialogue dataset for task-oriented document-grounded
dialogues annotated with demographic information, user emotions and implicit

have the potential to improve task completion and the factual consistency of

<p class="mathjax">Optimization of DR-submodular functions has experienced a notable surge in
significance in recent times, marking a pivotal development within the domain
of non-convex optimization. Motivated by real-world scenarios, some recent
works have delved into the maximization of non-monotone DR-submodular functions
over general (not necessarily down-closed) convex set constraints. Up to this
point, these works have all used the minimum $\ell_\infty$ norm of any feasible
solution as a parameter. Unfortunately, a recent hardness result due to Mualem
\&amp; Feldman~\cite{mualem2023resolving} shows that this approach cannot yield a
smooth interpolation between down-closed and non-down-closed constraints. In
this work, we suggest novel offline and online algorithms that provably provide
such an interpolation based on a natural decomposition of the convex body
constraint into two distinct convex bodies: a down-closed convex body and a
general convex body. We also empirically demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed algorithms across three offline and two online applications.

<p class="mathjax">This paper provides a comprehensive survey on pioneer and state-of-the-art 3D
scene geometry estimation methodologies based on single, two, or multiple
images captured under the omnidirectional optics. We first revisit the basic
concepts of the spherical camera model, and review the most common acquisition
technologies and representation formats suitable for omnidirectional (also
called 360$^\circ$, spherical or panoramic) images and videos. We then survey
monocular layout and depth inference approaches, highlighting the recent
advances in learning-based solutions suited for spherical data. The classical
stereo matching is then revised on the spherical domain, where methodologies
for detecting and describing sparse and dense features become crucial. The
stereo matching concepts are then extrapolated for multiple view camera setups,
categorizing them among light fields, multi-view stereo, and structure from
motion (or visual simultaneous localization and mapping). We also compile and
discuss commonly adopted datasets and figures of merit indicated for each
purpose and list recent results for completeness. We conclude this paper by
pointing out current and future trends.

<p class="mathjax">The relay channel with unreliable helper is introduced and studied. The model
is that of a classical relay channel where the input from the relay to the
channel has an extra primitive link whose presence is not assured a priori. The
extra link represents a helper who may decide not to cooperate in transmission.
The goal is to devise robust coding schemes that exploit all the relay links
when they are present, but can also operate, possibly at reduced rates, when
the extra primitive link (helper) is absent. The capacity region of this class
of problems is defined, and fully characterized for degraded relay channels.
The degraded Gaussian relay channel with unreliable relay link is solved.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the Multi-Objective Bi-Level Optimization (MOBLO)
problem, where the upper-level subproblem is a multi-objective optimization
problem and the lower-level subproblem is for scalar optimization. Existing
gradient-based MOBLO algorithms need to compute the Hessian matrix, causing the
computational inefficient problem. To address this, we propose an efficient
first-order multi-gradient method for MOBLO, called FORUM. Specifically, we
reformulate MOBLO problems as a constrained multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem via the value-function approach. Then we propose a novel multi-gradient
aggregation method to solve the challenging constrained MOO problem.
Theoretically, we provide the complexity analysis to show the efficiency of the
proposed method and a non-asymptotic convergence result. Empirically, extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed FORUM
method in different learning problems. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three multi-task learning benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Visuomotor policies, which learn control mechanisms directly from
high-dimensional visual observations, confront challenges in adapting to new
environments with intricate visual variations. Data augmentation emerges as a
promising method for bridging these generalization gaps by enriching data
variety. However, straightforwardly augmenting the entire observation shall
impose excessive burdens on policy learning and may even result in performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose to improve the generalization ability of
visuomotor policies as well as preserve training stability from two aspects: 1)
We learn a control-aware mask through a self-supervised reconstruction task
with three auxiliary losses and then apply strong augmentation only to those
control-irrelevant regions based on the mask to reduce the generalization gaps.
2) To address training instability issues prevalent in visual reinforcement
learning (RL), we distill the knowledge from a pretrained RL expert processing
low-level environment states, to the student visuomotor policy. The policy is
subsequently deployed to unseen environments without any further finetuning. We
conducted comparison and ablation studies across various benchmarks: the
DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB), the enhanced Robot Manipulation
Distraction Benchmark (RMDB), and a specialized long-horizontal drawer-opening
robotic task. The extensive experimental results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, e.g., showing a 17\% improvement over previous
methods in the video-hard setting of DMC-GB.

machine-learning augmented hybrid simulation, where parts of simulation
algorithms are replaced by data-driven surrogates. We first establish a
mathematical framework to understand the structure of machine-learning
augmented hybrid simulation problems, and the cause and effect of the
associated distribution shift. We show correlations between distribution shift
and simulation error both numerically and theoretically. Then, we propose a
simple methodology based on tangent-space regularized estimator to control the
distribution shift, thereby improving the long-term accuracy of the simulation
results. In the linear dynamics case, we provide a thorough theoretical
analysis to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we
conduct several numerical experiments, including simulating a partially known
reaction-diffusion equation and solving Navier-Stokes equations using the
projection method with a data-driven pressure solver. In all cases, we observe
marked improvements in simulation accuracy under the proposed method,
especially for systems with high degrees of distribution shift, such as those
with relatively strong non-linear reaction mechanisms, or flows at large

<p class="mathjax">Demystifying interactions between temporal patterns of different scales is
fundamental to precise long-range time series forecasting. However, previous
works lack the ability to model high-order interactions. To promote more
comprehensive pattern interaction modeling for long-range time series
forecasting, we propose a Multi-Scale Hypergraph Transformer (MSHyper)
framework. Specifically, a multi-scale hypergraph is introduced to provide
foundations for modeling high-order pattern interactions. Then by treating
hyperedges as nodes, we also build a hyperedge graph to enhance hypergraph
modeling. In addition, a tri-stage message passing mechanism is introduced to
aggregate pattern information and learn the interaction strength between
temporal patterns of different scales. Extensive experiments on five real-world
datasets demonstrate that MSHyper achieves state-of-the-art performance,
reducing prediction errors by an average of 8.73% and 7.15% over the best
baseline in MSE and MAE, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Deep clustering, which learns representation and semantic clustering without
labels information, poses a great challenge for deep learning-based approaches.
Despite significant progress in recent years, most existing methods focus on
uniformly distributed datasets, significantly limiting the practical
applicability of their methods. In this paper, we first introduce a more
practical problem setting named deep imbalanced clustering, where the
underlying classes exhibit an imbalance distribution. To tackle this problem,
we propose a novel pseudo-labeling-based learning framework. Our framework
formulates pseudo-label generation as a progressive partial optimal transport
problem, which progressively transports each sample to imbalanced clusters
under prior distribution constraints, thus generating imbalance-aware
pseudo-labels and learning from high-confident samples. In addition, we
transform the initial formulation into an unbalanced optimal transport problem
with augmented constraints, which can be solved efficiently by a fast matrix
scaling algorithm. Experiments on various datasets, including a human-curated
long-tailed CIFAR100, challenging ImageNet-R, and large-scale subsets of
fine-grained iNaturalist2018 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our
method.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning
paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and
private data on mobile clients. However, the location-dependent performance, in
terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses
major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy. The
challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that
authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients. In this
context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that
accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data,
transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness. Classifying
clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness
profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that
allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates
and an ascending trustworthiness constraint. In particular, the transmission
rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate
the convergence speed. Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission
rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients. The
aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for
transmission errors. Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the
base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage. The
proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only
allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the
trust metric). The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed
scheme in terms of accuracy and convergence speed when compared to both
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">The real numbers are important in both mathematics and computation theory.
Computationally, real numbers can be represented in several ways; most commonly
using inexact floating-point data-types, but also using exact
arbitrary-precision data-types which satisfy the expected mathematical
properties of the reals. This thesis is concerned with formalising properties
of certain types for exact real arithmetic, as well as utilising them
computationally for the purposes of search, optimisation and regression.
<br />We develop, in a constructive and univalent type-theoretic foundation of
mathematics, a formalised framework for performing search, optimisation and
regression on a wide class of types. This framework utilises Mart\'in
Escard\'o's prior work on searchable types, along with a convenient version of
ultrametric spaces -- which we call closeness spaces -- in order to
consistently search certain infinite types using the functional programming
language and proof assistant Agda.
<br />We formally define and prove the convergence properties of type-theoretic
variants of global optimisation and parametric regression, problems related to
search from the literature of analysis. As we work in a constructive setting,
these convergence theorems yield computational algorithms for correct
optimisation and regression on the types of our framework.
<br />Importantly, we can instantiate our framework on data-types from the
literature of exact real arithmetic, allowing us to perform our variants of
search, optimisation and regression on ternary signed-digit encodings of the
real numbers, as well as a simplified version of Hans-J. Boehm's functional
encodings of real numbers. Furthermore, we contribute to the extensive work on
ternary signed-digits by formally verifying the definition of certain exact
real arithmetic operations using the Escard\'o-Simpson interval object
specification of compact intervals.

<p class="mathjax">Arctic Permafrost is facing significant changes due to global climate change.
As these regions are largely inaccessible, remote sensing plays a crucial rule
in better understanding the underlying processes not just on a local scale, but
across the Arctic. In this study, we focus on the remote detection of
retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), a permafrost disturbance comparable to
landslides induced by thawing. For such analyses from space, deep learning has
become an indispensable tool, but limited labelled training data remains a
challenge for training accurate models. To improve model generalization across
the Arctic without the need for additional labelled data, we present a
semi-supervised learning approach to train semantic segmentation models to
detect RTS. Our framework called PixelDINO is trained in parallel on labelled
data as well as unlabelled data. For the unlabelled data, the model segments
the imagery into self-taught pseudo-classes and the training procedure ensures
consistency of these pseudo-classes across strong augmentations of the input
data. Our experimental results demonstrate that PixelDINO can improve model
performance both over supervised baseline methods as well as existing
semi-supervised semantic segmentation approaches, highlighting its potential
for training robust models that generalize well to regions that were not
included in the training data. The project page containing code and other
materials for this study can be found at

<p class="mathjax">A hot fix is an improvement to a specific time-critical issue deployed to a
software system in production. While hot fixing is an essential and common
activity in software maintenance, it has never been surveyed as a research
activity. Thus, such a review is long overdue. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive literature review of work on hot fixing. We highlight the fields
where this topic has been addressed, inconsistencies we identified in the
terminology, gaps in the literature, and directions for future work. Our search
concluded with 91 papers on the topic between the year 2000 and 2022. The
papers found encompass many different research areas such as log analysis,
runtime patching (also known as hot patching), and automated repair, as well as
various application domains such as security, mobile, and video games. We find
that there are many directions that can take hot fix research forward such as
unifying existing terminology, establishing a benchmark set of hot fixes,
researching costs and frequency of hot fixes, and researching the possibility
of end-to-end automation of detection, mitigation, and propagation. We discuss
these avenues in detail to inspire the community to systematize hot fixing as a
software engineering activity. We hope that this paper streamlines the existing
body of work and drives research in the area forward.

<p class="mathjax">Fast changing states or volatile environments pose a significant challenge to
online optimization, which needs to perform rapid adaptation under limited
observation. In this paper, we give query and regret optimal bandit algorithms
under the strict notion of strongly adaptive regret, which measures the maximum
regret over any contiguous interval $I$. Due to its worst-case nature, there is
an almost-linear $\Omega(|I|^{1-\epsilon})$ regret lower bound, when only one
query per round is allowed [Daniely el al, ICML 2015]. Surprisingly, with just
two queries per round, we give Strongly Adaptive Bandit Learner (StABL) that
achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n|I|})$ adaptive regret for multi-armed bandits with
$n$ arms. The bound is tight and cannot be improved in general. Our algorithm
leverages a multiplicative update scheme of varying stepsizes and a carefully
chosen observation distribution to control the variance. Furthermore, we extend
our results and provide optimal algorithms in the bandit convex optimization
setting. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our
algorithms under volatile environments and for downstream tasks, such as
algorithm selection for hyperparameter optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is a novel approach that augments existing DRAM
memory chips with lightweight logic. By allowing to offload computations to the
PIM system, this architecture allows for circumventing the data-bottleneck
problem that affects many modern workloads. This work tackles the problem of
how to build efficient software implementations of the Transactional Memory
(TM) abstraction by introducing PIM-STM, a library that provides a range of
diverse TM implementations for UPMEM, the first commercial PIM system. Via an
extensive study we assess the efficiency of alternative choices in the design
space of TM algorithms on this emerging architecture. We further quantify the
impact of using different memory tiers of the UPMEM system (having different
trade-offs for what concerns latency vs capacity) to store the metadata used by
different TM implementations. Finally, we assess the gains achievable in terms
of performance and memory efficiency when using PIM-STM to accelerate TM
applications originally conceived for conventional CPU-based systems.

<p class="mathjax">Deploying controllers trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) on real robots
can be challenging: RL relies on agents' policies being modeled as Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs), which assume an inherently discrete passage of time.
The use of MDPs results in that nearly all RL-based control systems employ a
fixed-rate control strategy with a period (or time step) typically chosen based
on the developer's experience or specific characteristics of the application
environment. Unfortunately, the system should be controlled at the highest,
worst-case frequency to ensure stability, which can demand significant
computational and energy resources and hinder the deployability of the
controller on onboard hardware. Adhering to the principles of reactive
programming, we surmise that applying control actions only when necessary
enables the use of simpler hardware and helps reduce energy consumption. We
challenge the fixed frequency assumption by proposing a variant of RL with
variable control rate. In this approach, the policy decides the action the
agent should take as well as the duration of the time step associated with that
action. In our new setting, we expand Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to compute the
optimal policy with a variable control rate, introducing the Soft Elastic
Actor-Critic (SEAC) algorithm. We show the efficacy of SEAC through a
proof-of-concept simulation driving an agent with Newtonian kinematics. Our
experiments show higher average returns, shorter task completion times, and
reduced computational resources when compared to fixed rate policies.

riddled with biases. We show that patterns in data might be noticed first or
more strongly, depending on how the data is visually represented or what the
viewer finds salient. We also demonstrate that viewer interpretation of data is
similar to that of 'ambiguous figures' such that two people looking at the same
data can come to different decisions. In our studies, participants read
visualizations depicting competitions between two entities, where one has a
historical lead (A) but the other has been gaining momentum (B) and predicted a
winner, across two chart types and three annotation approaches. They either saw
the historical lead as salient and predicted that A would win, or saw the
increasing momentum as salient and predicted B to win. These results suggest
that decisions can be influenced by both how data are presented and what

<p class="mathjax">Modern GPU applications, such as machine learning (ML) frameworks, can only
partially utilize beefy GPUs, leading to GPU underutilization in cloud
environments. Sharing GPUs across multiple applications from different users
can improve resource utilization and consequently cost, energy, and power
efficiency. However, GPU sharing creates memory safety concerns because kernels
must share a single GPU address space (GPU context). Previous GPU memory
protection approaches have limited deployability because they require
specialized hardware extensions or access to source code. This is often
unavailable in GPU-accelerated libraries heavily utilized by ML frameworks. In
this paper, we present G-Safe, a PTX-level bounds checking approach for GPUs
that limits GPU kernels of each application to stay within the memory partition
allocated to them. G-Safe relies on three mechanisms: (1) It divides the common
GPU address space into separate partitions for different applications. (2) It
intercepts and checks data transfers, fencing erroneous operations. (3) It
instruments all GPU kernels at the PTX level (available in closed GPU
libraries) fencing all kernel memory accesses outside application memory
bounds. We implement G-Safe as an external, dynamically linked library that can
be pre-loaded at application startup time. G-Safe's approach is transparent to
applications and can support real-life, complex frameworks, such as Caffe and
PyTorch, that issue billions of GPU kernels. Our evaluation shows that the
overhead of G-Safe compared to native (unprotected) for such frameworks is
between 4\% - 12\% and on average 9\%.

<p class="mathjax">We review studies based on analytic and simulation methods for hierarchical
performance analysis of Queueing Network - QN models, which result in an order
of magnitude reduction in performance evaluation cost with respect to
simulation. The computational cost at the lower level is reduced when the
computer system is modeled as a product-form QN. A Continuous Time Markov Chain
- CTMC or discrete-event simulation can then be used at the higher level. We
first consider a multiprogrammed transaction - txn processing system with
Poisson arrivals and predeclared locks requests. Txn throughputs obtained by
the analysis of multiprogrammed computer systems serve as the transition rates
in a higher level CTMC to determine txn response times. We next analyze a task
system where task precedence relationships are specified by a directed acyclic
graph to determine its makespan. Task service demands are specified on the
devices of a computer system. The composition of tasks in execution determines
txn throughputs, which serve as transition rates among the states of the higher
level CTMC model. As a third example we consider the hierarchical simulation of
a timesharing system with two user classes. Txn throughputs in processing
various combinations of requests are obtained by analyzing a closed
product-form QN model. A discrete event simulator is provided. More detailed QN
modeling parameters, such as the distribution of the number of cycles in
central server model - CSM affects the performance of a fork/join queueing
system. This detail can be taken into account in Schwetman's hybrid simulation
method, which counts remaining cycles in CSM. We propose an extension to hybrid
simulation to adjust job service demands according to elapsed time, rather than
counting cycles. An example where Equilibrium Point Analysis to reduce
computaional cost is privided.

<p class="mathjax">Foley sound, audio content inserted synchronously with videos, plays a
critical role in the user experience of multimedia content. Recently, there has
been active research in Foley sound synthesis, leveraging the advancements in
deep generative models. However, such works mainly focus on replicating a
single sound class or a textual sound description, neglecting temporal
information, which is crucial in the practical applications of Foley sound. We
present T-Foley, a Temporal-event-guided waveform generation model for Foley
sound synthesis. T-Foley generates high-quality audio using two conditions: the
sound class and temporal event feature. For temporal conditioning, we devise a
temporal event feature and a novel conditioning technique named Block-FiLM.
T-Foley achieves superior performance in both objective and subjective
evaluation metrics and generates Foley sound well-synchronized with the
temporal events. Additionally, we showcase T-Foley's practical applications,
particularly in scenarios involving vocal mimicry for temporal event control.
We show the demo on our companion website.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional visual-inertial state estimation targets absolute camera poses
and spatial landmark locations while first-order kinematics are typically
resolved as an implicitly estimated sub-state. However, this poses a risk in
velocity-based control scenarios, as the quality of the estimation of
kinematics depends on the stability of absolute camera and landmark coordinates
estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution to tight
visual-inertial fusion directly at the level of first-order kinematics by
employing a dynamic vision sensor instead of a normal camera. More
specifically, we leverage trifocal tensor geometry to establish an incidence
relation that directly depends on events and camera velocity, and demonstrate
how velocity estimates in highly dynamic situations can be obtained over short
time intervals. Noise and outliers are dealt with using a nested two-layer
RANSAC scheme. Additionally, smooth velocity signals are obtained from a tight
fusion with pre-integrated inertial signals using a sliding window optimizer.
Experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed tight
event-inertial fusion leads to continuous and reliable velocity estimation in
highly dynamic scenarios independently of absolute coordinates. Furthermore, in
extreme cases, it achieves more stable and more accurate estimation of
kinematics than traditional, point-position-based visual-inertial odometry.

<p class="mathjax">Active visual SLAM finds a wide array of applications in GNSS-Denied
sub-terrain environments and outdoor environments for ground robots. To achieve
robust localization and mapping accuracy, it is imperative to incorporate the
perception considerations in the goal selection and path planning towards the
goal during an exploration mission. Through this work, we propose FIT-SLAM
(Fisher Information and Traversability estimation-based Active SLAM), a new
exploration method tailored for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to explore 3D
environments. This approach is devised with the dual objectives of sustaining
an efficient exploration rate while optimizing SLAM accuracy. Initially, an
estimation of a global traversability map is conducted, which accounts for the
environmental constraints pertaining to traversability. Subsequently, we
propose a goal candidate selection approach along with a path planning method
towards this goal that takes into account the information provided by the
landmarks used by the SLAM backend to achieve robust localization and
successful path execution . The entire algorithm is tested and evaluated first
in a simulated 3D world, followed by a real-world environment and is compared
to pre-existing exploration methods. The results obtained during this
evaluation demonstrate a significant increase in the exploration rate while
effectively minimizing the localization covariance.

<p class="mathjax">Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) are a major class of
time-independent PDEs that play a key role in many scientific and engineering
domains such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and solid mechanics. Recently,
neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs
more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing
networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary
values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural
Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex
geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs.
Inspired by classical Green's function, BENO consists of two branches of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values,
respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary
geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of
the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary
conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the
solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded
architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong
baselines by an average of 60.96\%. Our source code can be found

<p class="mathjax">Sharing a physical environment, such as that of a wall-display, facilitates
gaining awareness of others' actions and intentions, thereby bringing benefits
for collaboration. Previous studies have provided first insights on awareness
in the context of tabletops or smaller vertical displays. This paper seeks to
advance the current understanding on how users share awareness information in
wall-display environments and focusses on mid-air pointing gestures as a
foundational part of communication. We present a scenario dealing with the
organization of medical supply chains in crisis situations, and report on the
results of a user study with 24 users, split into 6 groups of 4, performing
several tasks. We investigate pointing gestures and identify three subtypes
used as awareness cues during face-to-face collaboration: narrative pointing,
loose pointing, and sharp pointing. Our observations show that reliance on
gesture subtypes varies across participants and groups, and that sometimes
vague pointing is sufficient to support verbal negotiations.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the application of deep learning to change detection (CD) has
significantly progressed in remote sensing images. In recent years, CD tasks
have mostly used architectures such as CNN and Transformer to identify these
changes. However, these architectures have shortcomings in representing
boundary details and are prone to false alarms and missed detections under
complex lighting and weather conditions. For that, we propose a new network,
Siamese Meets Diffusion Network (SMDNet). This network combines the Siam-U2Net
Feature Differential Encoder (SU-FDE) and the denoising diffusion implicit
model to improve the accuracy of image edge change detection and enhance the
model's robustness under environmental changes. First, we propose an innovative
SU-FDE module that utilizes shared weight features to capture differences
between time series images and identify similarities between features to
enhance edge detail detection. Furthermore, we add an attention mechanism to
identify key coarse features to improve the model's sensitivity and accuracy.
Finally, the diffusion model of progressive sampling is used to fuse key coarse
features, and the noise reduction ability of the diffusion model and the
advantages of capturing the probability distribution of image data are used to
enhance the adaptability of the model in different environments. Our method's
combination of feature extraction and diffusion models demonstrates
effectiveness in change detection in remote sensing images. The performance
evaluation of SMDNet on LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, and CDD datasets yields validated
F1 scores of 90.99%, 88.40%, and 88.47%, respectively. This substantiates the
advanced capabilities of our model in accurately identifying variations and
intricate details.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past decade, the Gr\"obner basis theory and automatic solver
generation have lead to a large number of solutions to geometric vision
problems. In practically all cases, the derived solvers apply a fixed
elimination template to calculate the Gr\"obner basis and thereby identify the
zero-dimensional variety of the original polynomial constraints. However, it is
clear that different variable or monomial orderings lead to different
elimination templates, and we show that they may present a large variability in
accuracy for a certain instance of a problem. The present paper has two
contributions. We first show that for a common class of problems in geometric
vision, variable reordering simply translates into a permutation of the columns
of the initial coefficient matrix, and that -- as a result -- one and the same
elimination template can be reused in different ways, each one leading to
potentially different accuracy. We then prove that the original set of
coefficients may contain sufficient information to train a classifier for
online selection of a good solver, most notably at the cost of only a small
computational overhead. We demonstrate wide applicability at the hand of
generic dense polynomial problem solvers, as well as a concrete solver from
geometric vision.

<p class="mathjax">In computational social science, researchers often use a pre-trained, black
box classifier to estimate the frequency of each class in unlabeled datasets. A
variety of prevalence estimation techniques have been developed in the
literature, each yielding an unbiased estimate if certain stability assumption
holds. This work introduces a framework to rethink the prevalence estimation
process as calibrating the classifier outputs against ground truth labels to
obtain the joint distribution of a base dataset and then extrapolating to the
joint distribution of a target dataset. We call this framework
"Calibrate-Extrapolate". Visualizing the joint distribution makes the stability
assumption needed for a prevalence estimation technique clear and easy to
understand. In the calibration phase, the techniques assume only a stable
calibration curve between a calibration dataset and the full base dataset. This
allows for the classifier outputs to be used for purposive sampling, thus
improving the efficiency of calibration. In the extrapolation phase, some
techniques assume a stable calibration curve while some assume stable
class-conditional densities. We discuss the stability assumptions from a causal
perspective. By specifying base and target joint distributions, we can generate
simulated datasets, as a way to build intuitions about the impacts of
assumption violations. This also leads to a better understanding of how the
classifier predictive power affects the accuracy of prevalence estimates: the
greater the predictive power, the lower the sensitivity to violations of
stability assumptions in the extrapolation phase. We illustrate the framework
with an application that estimates the prevalence of toxic news comments over
time on Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube, using Jigsaw's Perspective API as a black
box classifier.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the promise of superior performance under challenging conditions,
event-based motion estimation remains a hard problem owing to the difficulty of
extracting and tracking stable features from event streams. In order to
robustify the estimation, it is generally believed that fusion with other
sensors is a requirement. In this work, we demonstrate reliable, purely
event-based visual odometry on planar ground vehicles by employing the
constrained non-holonomic motion model of Ackermann steering platforms. We
extend single feature n-linearities for regular frame-based cameras to the case
of quasi time-continuous event-tracks, and achieve a polynomial form via
variable degree Taylor expansions. Robust averaging over multiple event tracks
is simply achieved via histogram voting. As demonstrated on both simulated and
real data, our algorithm achieves accurate and robust estimates of the
vehicle's instantaneous rotational velocity, and thus results that are
comparable to the delta rotations obtained by frame-based sensors under normal
conditions. We furthermore significantly outperform the more traditional
alternatives in challenging illumination scenarios. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Vision-driven autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance of Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) along complex riverine environments for tasks like rescue and
surveillance requires a robust control policy, which is yet difficult to obtain
due to the shortage of trainable river environment simulators and reward
sparsity in such environments. To easily verify the navigation controller
performance for the river following task before real-world deployment, we
developed a trainable photo-realistic dynamics-free riverine simulation
environment using Unity. Successful river following trajectories in the
environment are manually collected and Behavior Clone (BC) is used to train an
Imitation Learning (IL) agent to mimic expert behavior and generate expert
guidance. Finally, a framework is proposed to train a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) agent using BC expert guidance and improve the expert policy
online by sampling good demonstrations produced by the DRL to increase
convergence rate and policy performance. This framework is able to solve the
along-river autonomous navigation task and outperform baseline RL and IL
methods. The code and trainable environments are available.

<p class="mathjax">Current methods to identify and classify racist language in text rely on
small-n qualitative approaches or large-n approaches focusing exclusively on
overt forms of racist discourse. This article provides a step-by-step
generalizable guideline to identify and classify different forms of racist
discourse in large corpora. In our approach, we start by conceptualizing racism
and its different manifestations. We then contextualize these racist
manifestations to the time and place of interest, which allows researchers to
identify their discursive form. Finally, we apply XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R), a
cross-lingual model for supervised text classification with a cutting-edge
contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our
pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying
racism in large corpora. We illustrate our approach using a corpus of tweets
relating to the Ecuadorian ind\'igena community between 2018 and 2021.

<p class="mathjax">A wide range of real-world applications is characterized by their symbolic
nature, necessitating a strong capability for symbolic reasoning. This paper
investigates the potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
symbolic reasoners. We focus on text-based games, significant benchmarks for
agents with natural language capabilities, particularly in symbolic tasks like
math, map reading, sorting, and applying common sense in text-based worlds. To
facilitate these agents, we propose an LLM agent designed to tackle symbolic
challenges and achieve in-game objectives. We begin by initializing the LLM
agent and informing it of its role. The agent then receives observations and a
set of valid actions from the text-based games, along with a specific symbolic
module. With these inputs, the LLM agent chooses an action and interacts with
the game environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly enhances the capability of LLMs as automated agents for symbolic
reasoning, and our LLM agent is effective in text-based games involving
symbolic tasks, achieving an average performance of 88% across all tasks.

<p class="mathjax">3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D
physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied
agents. In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding
language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent
complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich
attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D
vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a
unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data. In this
work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by
examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning
in indoor environments. We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language
dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising
2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable
scene-graph-based generation approach. We demonstrate that this scaling allows
for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS),
for 3D vision-language learning. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the
effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing
3D visual grounding benchmarks. The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is
unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D
vision-language tasks. Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io .

<p class="mathjax">Slot labelling is an essential component of any dialogue system, aiming to
find important arguments in every user turn. Common approaches involve large
pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT or RoBERTa, but they face
challenges such as high computational requirements and dependence on
pre-training data. In this work, we propose a lightweight method which performs
on par or better than the state-of-the-art PLM-based methods, while having
almost 10x less trainable parameters. This makes it especially applicable for
real-life industry scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">It is well known that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of field
theories are equivalent at the discrete time level when variational integrators
are used. Besides the symplectic Hamiltonian structure, many physical systems
exhibit a Hamiltonian structure when written in mixed form. In this
contribution, the discrete equivalence of Lagrangian, symplectic Hamiltonian
and mixed formulations is investigated for linear wave propagation phenomena.
Under compatibility conditions between the finite elements, the Lagrangian and
mixed formulations are indeed equivalent. For the time discretization the
leapfrog scheme and the implicit midpoint rule are considered. In mixed methods
applied to wave problems the primal variable (e.g. the displacement in
mechanics or the magnetic potential in electromagnetism) is not an unknown of
the problem and is reconstructed a posteriori from its time derivative. When
this reconstruction is performed via the trapezoidal rule, then these
time-discretization methods lead to equivalent formulations.

data is represented by hand-crafted features or learnt embeddings. Collect a
large enough quantity of such vectors and the question of retrieval becomes
urgently relevant: Finding vectors that are more similar to a query vector.
This monograph is concerned with the question above and covers fundamental

<p class="mathjax">Stability guarantees are crucial when ensuring a fully autonomous robot does
not take undesirable or potentially harmful actions. Unfortunately, global
stability guarantees are hard to provide in dynamical systems learned from
data, especially when the learned dynamics are governed by neural networks. We
propose a novel methodology to learn neural contractive dynamical systems,
where our neural architecture ensures contraction, and hence, global stability.
To efficiently scale the method to high-dimensional dynamical systems, we
develop a variant of the variational autoencoder that learns dynamics in a
low-dimensional latent representation space while retaining contractive
stability after decoding. We further extend our approach to learning
contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations to account for full-pose
end-effector dynamic motions. The result is the first highly flexible learning
architecture that provides contractive stability guarantees with capability to
perform obstacle avoidance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach
encodes the desired dynamics more accurately than the current state-of-the-art,
which provides less strong stability guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">The allreduce collective operation accounts for a significant fraction of the
runtime of workloads running on distributed systems. One factor determining its
performance is the distance between communicating nodes, especially on networks
like torus, where a higher distance implies multiple messages being forwarded
on the same link, thus reducing the allreduce bandwidth. Torus networks are
widely used on systems optimized for machine learning workloads (e.g., Google
TPUs and Amazon Trainium devices), as well as on some of the Top500
supercomputers. To improve allreduce performance on torus networks we introduce
Swing, a new algorithm that keeps a low distance between communicating nodes by
swinging between torus directions. Our analysis and experimental evaluation
show that Swing outperforms by up to 3x existing allreduce algorithms for
vectors ranging from 32B to 128MiB, on different types of torus and torus-like
topologies, regardless of their shape and size.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years witnessed a surge in network traffic due to the emergence of new
online services, causing periodic saturation and complexity problems.
Additionally, the growing number of IoT devices further compounds the problem.
Software Defined Network (SDN) is a new architecture which offers innovative
advantages that help to reduce saturation problems. Despite its benefits, SDNs
not only can be affected by traditional attacks but also introduce new security
challenges. In this context, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the
most important attacks that can damage an SDN network's normal operation.
Furthermore, if these attacks are executed using botnets, they can use
thousands of compromised devices to disrupt critical online services. This
paper proposes a framework for detecting DDoS attacks generated by a group of
botnets in an SDN network. The framework is implemented using open-source tools
such as Mininet and OpenDaylight and tested in a centralized network topology
using BYOB and SNORT. The results demonstrate real-time attack identification
by implementing an intrusion detection mechanism in the victim client. Our
proposed solution offers quick and effective detection of DDoS attacks in SDN
networks. The framework can successfully differentiate the type of attack with
high accuracy in a short time

<p class="mathjax">Extensive polling in shared-memory manycore systems can lead to contention,
decreased throughput, and poor energy efficiency. Both lock implementations and
the general-purpose atomic operation, load-reserved/store-conditional (LRSC),
cause polling due to serialization and retries. To alleviate this overhead, we
propose LRwait and SCwait, a synchronization pair that eliminates polling by
allowing contending cores to sleep while waiting for previous cores to finish
their atomic access. As a scalable implementation of LRwait, we present
Colibri, a distributed and scalable approach to managing LRwait reservations.
Through extensive benchmarking on an open-source RISC-V platform with 256
cores, we demonstrate that Colibri outperforms current synchronization
approaches for various concurrent algorithms with high and low contention
regarding throughput, fairness, and energy efficiency. With an area overhead of
only 6%, Colibri outperforms LRSC-based implementations by a factor of 6.5x in
terms of throughput and 7.1x in terms of energy efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Characterizing programming languages with variable binding as initial
objects, was first achieved by Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi in their seminal paper
published at LICS'99. To do so, in particular to prove initiality theorems,
they developed a framework based on monoidal categories, functors with
strengths, and $\Sigma$-monoids. An alternative approach using modules over
monads was later introduced by Hirschowitz and Maggesi, for endofunctor
categories, that is, for particular monoidal categories. This approach has the
advantage of providing a more general and abstract definition of signatures and
models; however, no general initiality result is known for this notion of
signature. Furthermore, Matthes and Uustalu provided a categorical formalism
for constructing (initial) monads via Mendler-style recursion, that can also be
used for initial semantics. The different approaches have been developed
further in several articles. However, in practice, the literature is difficult
to access, and links between the different strands of work remain
underexplored.
<br />In the present work, we give an introduction to initial semantics that
encompasses the three different strands. We develop a suitable "pushout" of
Hirschowitz and Maggesi's framework with Fiore's, and rely on Matthes and
Uustalu's formalism to provide modular proofs. For this purpose, we generalize
both Hirschowitz and Maggesi's framework, and Matthes and Uustalu's formalism
to the general setting of monoidal categories studied by Fiore and
collaborators. Moreover, we provide fully worked out presentation of some basic
instances of the literature, and an extensive discussion of related work
explaining the links between the different approaches.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies an evolving bulk--surface finite element method for a
model of tissue growth, which is a modification of the model of Eyles, King and
Styles (2019). The model couples a Poisson equation on the domain with a forced
mean curvature flow of the free boundary, with nontrivial bulk--surface
coupling in both the velocity law of the evolving surface and the boundary
condition of the Poisson equation. The numerical method discretizes evolution
equations for the mean curvature and the outer normal and it uses a harmonic
extension of the surface velocity into the bulk. The discretization admits a
convergence analysis in the case of continuous finite elements of polynomial
degree at least two. The stability of the discretized bulk--surface coupling is
a major concern. The error analysis combines stability estimates and
consistency estimates to yield optimal-order $H^1$-norm error bounds for the
computed tissue pressure and for the surface position, velocity, normal vector
and mean curvature. Numerical experiments illustrate and complement the
theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Self-navigation in non-coordinating crowded environments is formidably
challenging within multi-agent systems consisting of non-holonomic robots
operating through local sensing. Our primary objective is the development of a
novel, rapid, sensor-driven, self-navigation controller that directly computes
control commands to enable safe maneuvering while coexisting with other agents.
We propose an input-constrained feedback controller meticulously crafted for
non-holonomic mobile robots and the characterization of associated invariant
sets. The invariant sets are the key to maintaining stability and safety amidst
the non-cooperating agents. We then propose a planning strategy that
strategically guides the generation of invariant sets toward the agent's
intended target. This enables the agents to directly compute theoretically safe
control inputs without explicitly requiring pre-planned paths/trajectories to
reliably navigate through crowded multi-agent environments. The practicality of
our technique is demonstrated through hardware experiments, and the ability to
parallelize computations to shorten computational durations for synthesizing
safe control commands. The proposed approach finds potential applications in
crowded multi-agent scenarios that require rapid control computations based on
perceived safety bounds during run-time.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of machine learning and statistical modeling, practitioners
often work under the assumption of accessible, static, labeled data for
evaluation and training. However, this assumption often deviates from reality
where data may be private, encrypted, difficult- to-measure, or unlabeled. In
this paper, we bridge this gap by adapting the Hui-Walter paradigm, a method
traditionally applied in epidemiology and medicine, to the field of machine
learning. This approach enables us to estimate key performance metrics such as
false positive rate, false negative rate, and priors in scenarios where no
ground truth is available. We further extend this paradigm for handling online
data, opening up new possibilities for dynamic data environments. Our
methodology involves partitioning data into latent classes to simulate multiple
data populations (if natural populations are unavailable) and independently
training models to replicate multiple tests. By cross-tabulating binary
outcomes across ensemble categorizers and multiple populations, we are able to
estimate unknown parameters through Gibbs sampling, eliminating the need for
ground-truth or labeled data. This paper showcases the potential of our
methodology to transform machine learning practices by allowing for accurate
model assessment under dynamic and uncertain data conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Soft robotic shape estimation and proprioception are challenging because of
soft robot's complex deformation behaviors and infinite degrees of freedom. A
soft robot's continuously deforming body makes it difficult to integrate rigid
sensors and to reliably estimate its shape. In this work, we present
Proprioceptive Omnidirectional End-effector (POE), which has six embedded
microphones across the tendon-driven soft robot's surface. We first introduce
novel applications of previously proposed 3D reconstruction methods to acoustic
signals from the microphones for soft robot shape proprioception. To improve
the proprioception pipeline's training efficiency and model prediction
consistency, we present POE-M. POE-M first predicts key point positions from
the acoustic signal observations with the embedded microphone array. Then we
utilize an energy-minimization method to reconstruct a physically admissible
high-resolution mesh of POE given the estimated key points. We evaluate the
mesh reconstruction module with simulated data and the full POE-M pipeline with
real-world experiments. We demonstrate that POE-M's explicit guidance of the
key points during the mesh reconstruction process provides robustness and
stability to the pipeline with ablation studies. POE-M reduced the maximum
Chamfer distance error by 23.10 % compared to the state-of-the-art end-to-end
soft robot proprioception models and achieved 4.91 mm average Chamfer distance
error during evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Microarchitectural attacks compromise security by exploiting software-visible
artifacts of microarchitectural optimizations such as caches and speculative
execution. Defending against such attacks at the software level requires an
appropriate abstraction at the instruction set architecture (ISA) level that
captures microarchitectural leakage. Hardware-software leakage contracts have
recently been proposed as such an abstraction. In this paper, we propose a
semi-automatic methodology for synthesizing hardware-software leakage contracts
for open-source microarchitectures. For a given ISA, our approach relies on
human experts to (a) capture the space of possible contracts in the form of
contract templates and (b) devise a test-case generation strategy to explore a
microarchitecture's potential leakage. For a given implementation of an ISA,
these two ingredients are then used to automatically synthesize the most
precise leakage contract that is satisfied by the microarchitecture. We have
instantiated this methodology for the RISC-V ISA and applied it to the Ibex and
CVA6 open-source processors. Our experiments demonstrate the practical
applicability of the methodology and uncover subtle and unexpected leaks.

<p class="mathjax">Methods that use neural networks for synthesizing 3D shapes in the form of a
part-based representation have been introduced over the last few years. These
methods represent shapes as a graph or hierarchy of parts and enable a variety
of applications such as shape sampling and reconstruction. However, current
methods do not allow easily regenerating individual shape parts according to
user preferences. In this paper, we investigate techniques that allow the user
to generate multiple, diverse suggestions for individual parts. Specifically,
we experiment with multimodal deep generative models that allow sampling
diverse suggestions for shape parts and focus on models which have not been
considered in previous work on shape synthesis. To provide a comparative study
of these techniques, we introduce a method for synthesizing 3D shapes in a
part-based representation and evaluate all the part suggestion techniques
within this synthesis method. In our method, which is inspired by previous
work, shapes are represented as a set of parts in the form of implicit
functions which are then positioned in space to form the final shape. Synthesis
in this representation is enabled by a neural network architecture based on an
implicit decoder and a spatial transformer. We compare the various multimodal
generative models by evaluating their performance in generating part
suggestions. Our contribution is to show with qualitative and quantitative
evaluations which of the new techniques for multimodal part generation perform
the best and that a synthesis method based on the top-performing techniques
allows the user to more finely control the parts that are generated in the 3D
shapes while maintaining high shape fidelity when reconstructing shapes.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed considerable achievements in facial avatar
reconstruction with neural volume rendering. Despite notable advancements, the
reconstruction of complex and dynamic head movements from monocular videos
still suffers from capturing and restoring fine-grained details. In this work,
we propose a novel approach, named Tri$^2$-plane, for monocular photo-realistic
volumetric head avatar reconstructions. Distinct from the existing works that
rely on a single tri-plane deformation field for dynamic facial modeling, the
proposed Tri$^2$-plane leverages the principle of feature pyramids and three
top-to-down lateral connections tri-planes for details improvement. It samples
and renders facial details at multiple scales, transitioning from the entire
face to specific local regions and then to even more refined sub-regions.
Moreover, we incorporate a camera-based geometry-aware sliding window method as
an augmentation in training, which improves the robustness beyond the canonical
space, with a particular improvement in cross-identity generation capabilities.
Experimental outcomes indicate that the Tri$^2$-plane not only surpasses
existing methodologies but also achieves superior performance across both
quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments through experiments.

<p class="mathjax">The performance and safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) deteriorates under
adverse environments and adversarial actors. The investment in multi-sensor,
multi-agent (MSMA) AVs is meant to promote improved efficiency of travel and
mitigate safety risks. Unfortunately, minimal investment has been made to
develop security-aware MSMA sensor fusion pipelines leaving them vulnerable to
adversaries. To advance security analysis of AVs, we develop the Multi-Agent
Security Testbed, MAST, in the Robot Operating System (ROS2). Our framework is
scalable for general AV scenarios and is integrated with recent multi-agent
datasets. We construct the first bridge between AVstack and ROS and develop
automated AV pipeline builds to enable rapid AV prototyping. We tackle the
challenge of deploying variable numbers of agent/adversary nodes at launch-time
with dynamic topic remapping. Using this testbed, we motivate the need for
security-aware AV architectures by exposing the vulnerability of centralized
multi-agent fusion pipelines to (un)coordinated adversary models in case
studies and Monte Carlo analysis.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces CognitiveDog, a pioneering development of quadruped
robot with Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) that is capable of not only
communicating with humans verbally but also physically interacting with the
environment through object manipulation. The system was realized on Unitree Go1
robot-dog equipped with a custom gripper and demonstrated autonomous
decision-making capabilities, independently determining the most appropriate
actions and interactions with various objects to fulfill user-defined tasks.
These tasks do not necessarily include direct instructions, challenging the
robot to comprehend and execute them based on natural language input and
environmental cues. The paper delves into the intricacies of this system,
dataset characteristics, and the software architecture. Key to this development
is the robot's proficiency in navigating space using Visual-SLAM, effectively
manipulating and transporting objects, and providing insightful natural
language commentary during task execution. Experimental results highlight the
robot's advanced task comprehension and adaptability, underscoring its
potential in real-world applications. The dataset used to fine-tune the

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased striking
results on existing logical reasoning benchmarks, with some models even
surpassing human performance. However, the true depth of their competencies and
robustness, in mathematical reasoning tasks, remains an open question. In
response, we develop (i) an ontology of perturbations of maths questions, (ii)
a semi-automatic method of perturbation, and (iii) a dataset of perturbed maths
questions to probe the limits of LLM capabilities in mathematical reasoning
tasks. These controlled perturbations span across multiple fine dimensions of
the structural and representational aspects of maths questions. Using GPT-4, we
generated the MORE dataset by perturbing randomly selected five seed questions
from GSM8K. This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough
automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.
We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source
LLMs on MORE. The results show a significant performance drop across all the
models against the perturbed questions. This strongly suggests that current
LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities. This
research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current
models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future
development. Our dataset will be made publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE.

<p class="mathjax">With the recent proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been
an increasing demand for tools to detect machine-generated text. The effective
detection of machine-generated text face two pertinent problems: First, they
are severely limited in generalizing against real-world scenarios, where
machine-generated text is produced by a variety of generators, including but
not limited to GPT-4 and Dolly, and spans diverse domains, ranging from
academic manuscripts to social media posts. Second, existing detection
methodologies treat texts produced by LLMs through a restrictive binary
classification lens, neglecting the nuanced diversity of artifacts generated by
different LLMs. In this work, we undertake a systematic study on the detection
of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. We first study the
effectiveness of state-of-the-art approaches and find that they are severely
limited against text produced by diverse generators and domains in the real
world. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations of the embeddings from a pretrained
LLM's encoder show that they cannot reliably distinguish between human and
machine-generated text. Based on our findings, we introduce a novel system,
T5LLMCipher, for detecting machine-generated text using a pretrained T5 encoder
combined with LLM embedding sub-clustering to address the text produced by
diverse generators and domains in the real world. We evaluate our approach
across 9 machine-generated text systems and 9 domains and find that our
approach provides state-of-the-art generalization ability, with an average
increase in F1 score on machine-generated text of 19.6\% on unseen generators
and domains compared to the top performing existing approaches and correctly
attributes the generator of text with an accuracy of 93.6\%.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge can't be disentangled from people. As AI knowledge systems mine
vast volumes of work-related data, the knowledge that's being extracted and
surfaced is intrinsically linked to the people who create and use it. When
these systems get embedded in organizational settings, the information that is
brought to the foreground and the information that's pushed to the periphery
can influence how individuals see each other and how they see themselves at
work. In this paper, we present the looking-glass metaphor and use it to
conceptualize AI knowledge systems as systems that reflect and distort,
expanding our view on transparency requirements, implications and challenges.
We formulate transparency as a key mediator in shaping different ways of
seeing, including seeing into the system, which unveils its capabilities,
limitations and behavior, and seeing through the system, which shapes workers'
perceptions of their own contributions and others within the organization.
Recognizing the sociotechnical nature of these systems, we identify three
transparency dimensions necessary to realize the value of AI knowledge systems,
namely system transparency, procedural transparency and transparency of
outcomes. We discuss key challenges hindering the implementation of these forms
of transparency, bringing to light the wider sociotechnical gap and
highlighting directions for future Computer-supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
research.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of weakly-private information retrieval (WPIR) when
data is encoded by a maximum distance separable code and stored across multiple
servers. In WPIR, a user wishes to retrieve a piece of data from a set of
servers without leaking too much information about which piece of data she is
interested in. We study and provide the first WPIR protocols for this scenario
and present results on their optimal trade-off between download rate and

<p class="mathjax">We describe an approach to predict open-vocabulary 3D semantic voxel
occupancy map from input 2D images with the objective of enabling 3D grounding,
segmentation and retrieval of free-form language queries. This is a challenging
problem because of the 2D-3D ambiguity and the open-vocabulary nature of the
target tasks, where obtaining annotated training data in 3D is difficult. The
contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we design a new model
architecture for open-vocabulary 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The
architecture consists of a 2D-3D encoder together with occupancy prediction and
3D-language heads. The output is a dense voxel map of 3D grounded language
embeddings enabling a range of open-vocabulary tasks. Second, we develop a
tri-modal self-supervised learning algorithm that leverages three modalities:
(i) images, (ii) language and (iii) LiDAR point clouds, and enables training
the proposed architecture using a strong pre-trained vision-language model
without the need for any 3D manual language annotations. Finally, we
demonstrate quantitatively the strengths of the proposed model on several
open-vocabulary tasks: Zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation using existing
datasets; 3D grounding and retrieval of free-form language queries, using a
small dataset that we propose as an extension of nuScenes. You can find the

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present Vlogger, a generic AI system for generating a
minute-level video blog (i.e., vlog) of user descriptions. Different from short
videos with a few seconds, vlog often contains a complex storyline with
diversified scenes, which is challenging for most existing video generation
approaches. To break through this bottleneck, our Vlogger smartly leverages
Large Language Model (LLM) as Director and decomposes a long video generation
task of vlog into four key stages, where we invoke various foundation models to
play the critical roles of vlog professionals, including (1) Script, (2) Actor,
(3) ShowMaker, and (4) Voicer. With such a design of mimicking human beings,
our Vlogger can generate vlogs through explainable cooperation of top-down
planning and bottom-up shooting. Moreover, we introduce a novel video diffusion
model, ShowMaker, which serves as a videographer in our Vlogger for generating
the video snippet of each shooting scene. By incorporating Script and Actor
attentively as textual and visual prompts, it can effectively enhance
spatial-temporal coherence in the snippet. Besides, we design a concise mixed
training paradigm for ShowMaker, boosting its capacity for both T2V generation
and prediction. Finally, the extensive experiments show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot T2V generation and
prediction tasks. More importantly, Vlogger can generate over 5-minute vlogs
from open-world descriptions, without loss of video coherence on script and
actor. The code and model is all available at

<p class="mathjax">We present TextureDreamer, a novel image-guided texture synthesis method to
transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images (3 to 5) to
target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. Texture creation is a pivotal
challenge in vision and graphics. Industrial companies hire experienced artists
to manually craft textures for 3D assets. Classical methods require densely
sampled views and accurately aligned geometry, while learning-based methods are
confined to category-specific shapes within the dataset. In contrast,
TextureDreamer can transfer highly detailed, intricate textures from real-world
environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images,
potentially significantly democratizing texture creation. Our core idea,
personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD), draws inspiration from
recent advancements in diffuse models, including personalized modeling for
texture information extraction, variational score distillation for detailed
appearance synthesis, and explicit geometry guidance with ControlNet. Our
integration and several essential modifications substantially improve the
texture quality. Experiments on real images spanning different categories show
that TextureDreamer can successfully transfer highly realistic, semantic
meaningful texture to arbitrary objects, surpassing the visual quality of
previous state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs,
i.e., Mamba, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Building
efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing
direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the
position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for
visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance of visual
representation learning on self-attention is not necessary and propose a new
generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the
image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual
representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet
classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks,
Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision
transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved
computation &amp; memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\times$ faster than
DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract
features on images with a resolution of 1248$\times$1248. The results
demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation &amp; memory
constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution
images and it has great potential to become the next-generation backbone for
vision foundation models. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Vim.

<p class="mathjax">Grouping is inherently ambiguous due to the multiple levels of granularity in
which one can decompose a scene -- should the wheels of an excavator be
considered separate or part of the whole? We present Group Anything with
Radiance Fields (GARField), an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a
hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. To do this
we embrace group ambiguity through physical scale: by optimizing a
scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, a point in the world can belong to
different groups of different sizes. We optimize this field from a set of 2D
masks provided by Segment Anything (SAM) in a way that respects coarse-to-fine
hierarchy, using scale to consistently fuse conflicting masks from different
viewpoints. From this field we can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via
automatic tree construction or user interaction. We evaluate GARField on a
variety of in-the-wild scenes and find it effectively extracts groups at many
levels: clusters of objects, objects, and various subparts. GARField inherently
represents multi-view consistent groupings and produces higher fidelity groups
than the input SAM masks. GARField's hierarchical grouping could have exciting
downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene
understanding. See the project website at https://www.garfield.studio/

<p class="mathjax">When arranged in a crossbar configuration, resistive memory devices can be
used to execute MVM, the most dominant operation of many ML algorithms, in
constant time complexity. Nonetheless, when performing computations in the
analog domain, novel challenges are introduced in terms of arithmetic precision
and stochasticity, due to non-ideal circuit and device behaviour. Moreover,
these non-idealities have a temporal dimension, resulting in a degrading
application accuracy over time. Facing these challenges, we propose a novel
framework, named LionHeart, to obtain hybrid analog-digital mappings to execute
DL inference workloads using heterogeneous accelerators. The
accuracy-constrained mappings derived by LionHeart showcase, across different
DNNs and datasets, high accuracy and potential for speedup. The results of the
full system simulations highlight run-time reductions and energy efficiency
gains that exceed 6X, with a user-defined accuracy threshold with respect to a
fully digital floating point implementation.

<p class="mathjax">Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices
with error correction. Today, the most promising approach is a class of
error-correcting codes called surface codes. In this paper, we study the
problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing
surface codes. The problem involves (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device
qubits and (2) routing execution paths between pairs of interacting qubits. We
call this the surface code mapping and routing problem (SCMR).
<br />Solving SCMR near-optimally is critical for both efficiency and correctness.
An optimal solution limits the cost of a computation in terms of precious
quantum resources and also minimizes the probability of incurring an undetected
logical error, which increases with each additional time step.
<br />We study SCMR from a theoretical and practical perspective. First, we prove
that SCMR, as well as a constrained version of the problem, is NP-complete.
Second, we present a optimal algorithm for solving SCMR that is based on a SAT
encoding. Third, we present a spectrum of efficient relaxations of SCMR, for
example, by exploiting greedy algorithms for solving the problem of
node-disjoint paths. Finally, we implement and evaluate our algorithms on a
large suite of real and synthetic circuits. Our results suggest that our
relaxations are a powerful tool for compiling realistic workloads. The
relaxation-based algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the optimal
algorithm (solving instances with tens of thousands of gates in minutes), while
still finding high-quality solutions, achieving the theoretical lower bound on
up to 55 out of 168 circuits from a diverse benchmark suite.

<p class="mathjax">In this article we present a new modelling framework for structured concepts
using a category-theoretic generalisation of conceptual spaces, and show how
the conceptual representations can be learned automatically from data, using
two very different instantiations: one classical and one quantum. A
contribution of the work is a thorough category-theoretic formalisation of our
framework. We claim that the use of category theory, and in particular the use
of string diagrams to describe quantum processes, helps elucidate some of the
most important features of our approach. We build upon Gardenfors' classical
framework of conceptual spaces, in which cognition is modelled geometrically
through the use of convex spaces, which in turn factorise in terms of simpler
spaces called domains. We show how concepts from the domains of shape, colour,
size and position can be learned from images of simple shapes, where concepts
are represented as Gaussians in the classical implementation, and quantum
effects in the quantum one. In the classical case we develop a new model which
is inspired by the Beta-VAE model of concepts, but is designed to be more
closely connected with language, so that the names of concepts form part of the
graphical model. In the quantum case, concepts are learned by a hybrid
classical-quantum network trained to perform concept classification, where the
classical image processing is carried out by a convolutional neural network and
the quantum representations are produced by a parameterised quantum circuit.
Finally, we consider the question of whether our quantum models of concepts can
be considered conceptual spaces in the Gardenfors sense.

<p class="mathjax">Lido, the leading Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) provider on Ethereum,
allows users to stake an arbitrary amount of ETH to receive stETH, which can be
integrated with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols such as Aave. The
composability between Lido and Aave enables a novel strategy called "leverage
staking", where users stake ETH on Lido to acquire stETH, utilize stETH as
collateral on Aave to borrow ETH, and then restake the borrowed ETH on Lido.
Users can iteratively execute this process to optimize potential returns based
on their risk profile.
<br />This paper systematically studies the opportunities and risks associated with
leverage staking. We are the first to formalize the leverage staking strategy
within the Lido-Aave ecosystem. Our empirical study identifies 262 leverage
staking positions on Ethereum, with an aggregated staking amount of 295,243 ETH
(482M USD). We discover that 90.13% of leverage staking positions have achieved
higher returns than conventional staking. Furthermore, we perform stress tests
to evaluate the risk introduced by leverage staking under extreme conditions.
We find that leverage staking significantly amplifies the risk of cascading
liquidations. We hope this paper can inform and encourage the development of
robust risk management approaches to protect the Lido-Aave LSD ecosystem.

<p class="mathjax">Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used disordered materials. Understanding
the relationship between the local structure and physical properties of MGs is
one of the greatest challenges for both material science and condensed matter
physics. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the
atomic graph structure and study the connection between the structure and the
corresponding local energy barrier, which is believed to govern many critical
physical properties in MGs. One of our key contributions is to propose a novel
Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model for predicting the energy barriers, which is
invariant under orthogonal transformations of the structure, e.g., rotations
and reflections. Such invariance is a desired property that standard GNNs like
Graph Convolutional Networks cannot capture. SymGNNs handle the invariance by
aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure for
representation learning, and an optimal distribution over all 3D orthogonal
transformations $\mathcal{O}_3$ is learned to maximize the benefit of
invariance. We demonstrate in our experiments that SymGNN can significantly
improve the energy barrier prediction over other GNNs and non-graph machine
learning models. With such an accurate model, we also apply graph explanation
algorithms to better reveal the structure-property relationship of MGs. Our GNN
framework allows effective prediction of material physical properties and
bolsters material science research through the use of AI models.

<p class="mathjax">This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First,
various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to
verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows
automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh
generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs)
framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios.
Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric
Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the
Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from
different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also
proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the
extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity
approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity
DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in
DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The
DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT
scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing
engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.

<p class="mathjax">Wave runup is a critical factor affecting coastal flooding, shoreline
changes, and damage to coastal structures. Climate change is also expected to
amplify wave runup's impact on coastal areas. Therefore, fast and accurate wave
runup estimation is essential for effective coastal engineering design and
management. However, predicting the time-dependent wave runup is challenging
due to the intrinsic nonlinearities and non-stationarity of the process, even
with the use of the most advanced machine learning techniques. In this study, a
physics-informed machine learning-based approach is proposed to efficiently and
accurately simulate time-series wave runup. The methodology combines the
computational efficiency of the Surfbeat (XBSB) mode with the accuracy of the
nonhydrostatic (XBNH) mode of the XBeach model. Specifically, a conditional
generative adversarial network (cGAN) is used to map the image representation
of wave runup from XBSB to the corresponding image from XBNH. These images are
generated by first converting wave runup signals into time-frequency scalograms
and then transforming them into image representations. The cGAN model achieves
improved performance in image-to-image mapping tasks by incorporating
physics-based knowledge from XBSB. After training the model, the high-fidelity
XBNH-based scalograms can be predicted, which are then employed to reconstruct
the time-series wave runup using the inverse wavelet transform. The simulation
results underscore the efficiency and robustness of the proposed model in
predicting wave runup, suggesting its potential value for applications in risk
assessment and management.

<p class="mathjax">In an era characterized by the pervasive integration of artificial
intelligence into decision-making processes across diverse industries, the
demand for trust has never been more pronounced. This thesis embarks on a
comprehensive exploration of bias and fairness, with a particular emphasis on
their ramifications within the banking sector, where AI-driven decisions bear
substantial societal consequences. In this context, the seamless integration of
fairness, explainability, and human oversight is of utmost importance,
culminating in the establishment of what is commonly referred to as
"Responsible AI". This emphasizes the critical nature of addressing biases
within the development of a corporate culture that aligns seamlessly with both
AI regulations and universal human rights standards, particularly in the realm
of automated decision-making systems. Nowadays, embedding ethical principles
into the development, training, and deployment of AI models is crucial for
compliance with forthcoming European regulations and for promoting societal
good. This thesis is structured around three fundamental pillars: understanding
bias, mitigating bias, and accounting for bias. These contributions are
validated through their practical application in real-world scenarios, in
collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo. This collaborative effort not only
contributes to our understanding of fairness but also provides practical tools
for the responsible implementation of AI-based decision-making systems. In line
with open-source principles, we have released Bias On Demand and FairView as
accessible Python packages, further promoting progress in the field of AI
fairness.

<p class="mathjax">This study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of single-objective and
multi-objective optimisation algorithms for the design of an elbow-type draft
tube, as well as to introduce a computationally efficient optimisation
workflow. The proposed workflow leverages deep neural network surrogates
trained on data obtained from numerical simulations. The use of surrogates
allows for a more flexible and faster evaluation of novel designs. The success
history-based adaptive differential evolution with linear reduction and the
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition were identified
as the best-performing algorithms and used to determine the influence of
different objectives in the single-objective optimisation and their combined
impact on the draft tube design in the multi-objective optimisation. The
results for the single-objective algorithm are consistent with those of the
multi-objective algorithm when the objectives are considered separately.
Multi-objective approach, however, should typically be chosen, especially for
computationally inexpensive surrogates. A multi-criteria decision analysis
method was used to obtain optimal multi-objective results, showing an
improvement of 1.5% and 17% for the pressure recovery factor and drag
coefficient, respectively. The difference between the predictions and the
numerical results is less than 0.5% for the pressure recovery factor and 3% for
the drag coefficient. As the demand for renewable energy continues to increase,
the relevance of data-driven optimisation workflows, as discussed in this
study, will become increasingly important, especially in the context of global
sustainability efforts.

<p class="mathjax">As artificial intelligence and machine learning tools become more accessible,
and scientists face new obstacles to data collection (e.g. rising costs,
declining survey response rates), researchers increasingly use predictions from
pre-trained algorithms as outcome variables. Though appealing for financial and
logistical reasons, using standard tools for inference can misrepresent the
association between independent variables and the outcome of interest when the
true, unobserved outcome is replaced by a predicted value. In this paper, we
characterize the statistical challenges inherent to this so-called
``post-prediction inference'' problem and elucidate three potential sources of
error: (i) the relationship between predicted outcomes and their true,
unobserved counterparts, (ii) robustness of the machine learning model to
resampling or uncertainty about the training data, and (iii) appropriately
propagating not just bias but also uncertainty from predictions into the
ultimate inference procedure. We also contrast the framework for
post-prediction inference with classical work spanning several related fields,
including survey sampling, missing data, and semi-supervised learning. This
contrast elucidates the role of design in both classical and modern inference
problems.

<p class="mathjax">Breast cancer prognosis is crucial for effective treatment, with the disease
more common in women over 40 years old but rare under 40 years old, where less
than 5 percent of cases occur in the U.S. Studies indicate a worse prognosis in
younger women, which varies by ethnicity. Breast cancers are classified based
on receptors like estrogen, progesterone, and HER2. Triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC), lacking these receptors, accounts for about 15 percent of cases
and is more prevalent in younger patients, often resulting in poorer outcomes.
Nevertheless, the impact of age on TNBC prognosis remains unclear. Factors like
age, race, tumor grade, size, and lymph node status are studied for their role
in TNBC's clinical outcomes, but current research is inconclusive about
age-related differences. This study uses SEER data set to examine the influence
of younger age on survivability in TNBC patients, aiming to determine if age is
a significant prognostic factor. Our experimental results on SEER dataset
confirm the existing research reports that TNBC patients have worse prognosis
compared to non-TNBC based on age. Our main goal was to investigate whether
younger age has any significance on the survivability of TNBC patients.
Experimental results do not show that younger age has any significance on the
prognosis and survival rate of the TNBC patients

<p class="mathjax">Ambient air pollution remains a critical issue in the United Kingdom, where
data on air pollution concentrations form the foundation for interventions
aimed at improving air quality. However, the current air pollution monitoring
station network in the UK is characterized by spatial sparsity, heterogeneous
placement, and frequent temporal data gaps, often due to issues such as power
outages. We introduce a scalable data-driven supervised machine learning model
framework designed to address temporal and spatial data gaps by filling missing
measurements. This approach provides a comprehensive dataset for England
throughout 2018 at a 1kmx1km hourly resolution. Leveraging machine learning
techniques and real-world data from the sparsely distributed monitoring
stations, we generate 355,827 synthetic monitoring stations across the study
area, yielding data valued at approximately \pounds70 billion. Validation was
conducted to assess the model's performance in forecasting, estimating missing
locations, and capturing peak concentrations. The resulting dataset is of
particular interest to a diverse range of stakeholders engaged in downstream
assessments supported by outdoor air pollution concentration data for NO2, O3,
PM10, PM2.5, and SO2. This resource empowers stakeholders to conduct studies at
a higher resolution than was previously possible.

<p class="mathjax">This study introduces the Supervised Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (SMAS)
methodology, a machine learning-based approach, for analyzing gene expression
data obtained from nonhuman primates (NHPs) infected with Ebola virus (EBOV).
We utilize a comprehensive dataset of NanoString gene expression profiles from
Ebola-infected NHPs, deploying the SMAS system for nuanced host-pathogen
interaction analysis. SMAS effectively combines gene selection based on
statistical significance and expression changes, employing linear classifiers
such as logistic regression to accurately differentiate between RT-qPCR
positive and negative NHP samples. A key finding of our research is the
identification of IFI6 and IFI27 as critical biomarkers, demonstrating
exceptional predictive performance with 100% accuracy and Area Under the Curve
(AUC) metrics in classifying various stages of Ebola infection. Alongside IFI6
and IFI27, genes, including MX1, OAS1, and ISG15, were significantly
upregulated, highlighting their essential roles in the immune response to EBOV.
Our results underscore the efficacy of the SMAS method in revealing complex
genetic interactions and response mechanisms during EBOV infection. This
research provides valuable insights into EBOV pathogenesis and aids in
developing more precise diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies to address
EBOV infection in particular and viral infection in general.

<p class="mathjax">Dirac delta distributionally sourced differential equations emerge in many
dynamical physical systems from neuroscience to black hole perturbation theory.
Most of these lack exact analytical solutions and are thus best tackled
numerically. This work describes a generic numerical algorithm which constructs
discontinuous spatial and temporal discretisations by operating on
discontinuous Lagrange and Hermite interpolation formulae recovering higher
order accuracy. It is shown by solving the distributionally sourced wave
equation, which has analytical solutions, that numerical weak-form solutions
can be recovered to high order accuracy by solving a first-order reduced system
of ordinary differential equations. The method-of-lines framework is applied to
the DiscoTEX algorithm i.e through discontinuous collocation with
implicit-turned-explicit (IMTEX) integration methods which are symmetric and
conserve symplectic structure. Furthermore, the main application of the
algorithm is proved, for the first-time, by calculating the amplitude at any
desired location within the numerical grid, including at the position (and at
its right and left limit) where the wave- (or wave-like) equation is
discontinuous via interpolation using DiscoTEX. This is shown, firstly by
solving the wave- (or wave-like) equation and comparing the numerical weak-form
solution to the exact solution. Finally, one shows how to reconstruct the
scalar and gravitational metric perturbations from weak-form numerical
solutions of a non-rotating black hole, which do not have known exact
analytical solutions, and compare against state-of-the-art frequency domain
results. One concludes by motivating how DiscoTEX, and related algorithms, open
a promising new alternative Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral (EMRI)s waveform
generation route via a self-consistent evolution for the gravitational
self-force programme in the time-domain.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel method for anomaly detection in Solar System object data,
in preparation for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. We train a deep
autoencoder for anomaly detection and use the learned latent space to search
for other interesting objects. We demonstrate the efficacy of the autoencoder
approach by finding interesting examples, such as interstellar objects, and
show that using the autoencoder, further examples of interesting classes can be
found. We also investigate the limits of classic unsupervised approaches to
anomaly detection through the generation of synthetic anomalies and evaluate
the feasibility of using a supervised learning approach. Future work should
consider expanding the feature space to increase the variety of anomalies that
can be uncovered during the survey using an autoencoder.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly, or out-of-distribution, detection is a promising tool for aiding
discoveries of new particles or processes in particle physics. In this work, we
identify and address two overlooked opportunities to improve anomaly detection
for high-energy physics. First, rather than train a generative model on the
single most dominant background process, we build detection algorithms using
representation learning from multiple background types, thus taking advantage
of more information to improve estimation of what is relevant for detection.
Second, we generalize decorrelation to the multi-background setting, thus
directly enforcing a more complete definition of robustness for anomaly
detection. We demonstrate the benefit of the proposed robust multi-background
anomaly detection algorithms on a high-dimensional dataset of particle decays
at the Large Hadron Collider.

<p class="mathjax">A well-established research line in structural and algorithmic graph theory
is characterizing graph classes by listing their minimal obstructions. When
this list is finite for some class $\mathcal C$ we obtain a polynomial-time
algorithm for recognizing graphs in $\mathcal C$, and from a logic point of
view, having finitely many obstructions corresponds to being definable by a
universal sentence. However, in many cases we study classes with infinite sets
of minimal obstructions, and this might have neither algorithmic nor logic
implications for such a class. Some decades ago, Skrien (1982) and Damaschke
(1990) introduced finite expressions of graph classes by means of forbidden
orientations and forbidden linear orderings, and recently, similar research
lines appeared in the literature, such as expressions by forbidden circular
orders, by forbidden tree-layouts, and by forbidden edge-coloured graphs. In
this paper, we introduce local expressions of graph classes; a general
framework for characterizing graph classes by forbidden equipped graphs. In
particular, it encompasses all research lines mentioned above, and we provide
some new examples of such characterizations. Moreover, we see that every local
expression of a class $\mathcal C$ yields a polynomial-time certification
algorithm for graphs in $\mathcal C$. Finally, from a logic point of view, we
show that being locally expressible corresponds to being definable in the logic
SNP introduced by Feder and Vardi (1999).

<p class="mathjax">Raman spectroscopy, a photonic modality based on the inelastic backscattering
of coherent light, is a valuable asset to the intraoperative sensing space,
offering non-ionizing potential and highly-specific molecular fingerprint-like
spectroscopic signatures that can be used for diagnosis of pathological tissue
in the dynamic surgical field. Though Raman suffers from weakness in intensity,
Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), which uses metal nanostructures to
amplify Raman signals, can achieve detection sensitivities that rival
traditional photonic modalities. In this study, we outline a robotic Raman
system that can reliably pinpoint the location and boundaries of a tumor
embedded in healthy tissue, modeled here as a tissue-mimicking phantom with
selectively infused Gold Nanostar regions. Further, due to the relative dearth
of collected biological SERS or Raman data, we implement transfer learning to
achieve 100% validation classification accuracy for Gold Nanostars compared to
Control Agarose, thus providing a proof-of-concept for Raman-based deep
learning training pipelines. We reconstruct a surgical field of 30x60mm in 10.2
minutes, and achieve 98.2% accuracy, preserving relative measurements between
features in the phantom. We also achieve an 84.3% Intersection-over-Union
score, which is the extent of overlap between the ground truth and predicted
reconstructions. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the Raman system and
classification algorithm do not discern based on sample color, but instead on
presence of SERS agents. This study provides a crucial step in the translation
of intelligent Raman systems in intraoperative oncological spaces.

<p class="mathjax">Existing studies on self-supervised speech representation learning have
focused on developing new training methods and applying pre-trained models for
different applications. However, the quality of these models is often measured
by the performance of different downstream tasks. How well the representations
access the information of interest is less studied. In this work, we take a
closer look into existing self-supervised methods of speech from an
information-theoretic perspective. We aim to develop metrics using mutual
information to help practical problems such as model design and selection. We
use linear probes to estimate the mutual information between the target
information and learned representations, showing another insight into the
accessibility to the target information from speech representations. Further,
we explore the potential of evaluating representations in a self-supervised
fashion, where we estimate the mutual information between different parts of
the data without using any labels. Finally, we show that both supervised and
unsupervised measures echo the performance of the models on layer-wise linear
probing and speech recognition.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning techniques, despite their potential, often suffer from a lack
of reproducibility and generalizability, impeding their clinical adoption.
Image segmentation is one of the critical tasks in medical image analysis, in
which one or several regions/volumes of interest should be annotated. This
paper introduces the RIDGE checklist, a framework for assessing the
Reproducibility, Integrity, Dependability, Generalizability, and Efficiency of
deep learning-based medical image segmentation models. The checklist serves as
a guide for researchers to enhance the quality and transparency of their work,
ensuring that segmentation models are not only scientifically sound but also
clinically relevant.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a neural network model that can separate target speech sources
from interfering sources at different angular regions using two microphones.
The model is trained with simulated room impulse responses (RIRs) using
omni-directional microphones without needing to collect real RIRs. By relying
on specific angular regions and multiple room simulations, the model utilizes
consistent time difference of arrival (TDOA) cues, or what we call delay
contrast, to separate target and interference sources while remaining robust in
various reverberation environments. We demonstrate the model is not only
generalizable to a commercially available device with a slightly different
microphone geometry, but also outperforms our previous work which uses one
additional microphone on the same device. The model runs in real-time on-device
and is suitable for low-latency streaming applications such as telephony and
video conferencing.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of artificial intelligence
(AI) applications in transportation. As a new and emerging technology, AI's
potential to advance transportation goals and the full extent of its impacts on
the transportation sector is not yet well understood. As the transportation
community explores these topics, it is critical to understand how
transportation professionals, the driving force behind AI Transportation
applications, perceive AI's potential efficiency and equity impacts. Toward
this goal, we surveyed transportation professionals in the United States and
collected a total of 354 responses. Based on the survey responses, we conducted
both descriptive analysis and latent class cluster analysis (LCCA). The former
provides an overview of prevalent attitudes among transportation professionals,
while the latter allows the identification of distinct segments based on their
latent attitudes toward AI. We find widespread optimism regarding AI's
potential to improve many aspects of transportation (e.g., efficiency, cost
reduction, and traveler experience); however, responses are mixed regarding
AI's potential to advance equity. Moreover, many respondents are concerned that
AI ethics are not well understood in the transportation community and that AI
use in transportation could exaggerate existing inequalities. Through LCCA, we
have identified four latent segments: AI Neutral, AI Optimist, AI Pessimist,
and AI Skeptic. The latent class membership is significantly associated with
respondents' age, education level, and AI knowledge level. Overall, the study
results shed light on the extent to which the transportation community as a
whole is ready to leverage AI systems to transform current practices and inform
targeted education to improve the understanding of AI among transportation
professionals.

<p class="mathjax">Endpoint (EP) detection is a key component of far-field speech recognition
systems that assist the user through voice commands. The endpoint detector has
to trade-off between accuracy and latency, since waiting longer reduces the
cases of users being cut-off early. We propose a novel two-pass solution for
endpointing, where the utterance endpoint detected from a first pass endpointer
is verified by a 2nd-pass model termed EP Arbitrator. Our method improves the
trade-off between early cut-offs and latency over a baseline endpointer, as
tested on datasets including voice-assistant transactional queries,
conversational speech, and the public SLURP corpus. We demonstrate that our
method shows improvements regardless of the first-pass EP model used.

<p class="mathjax">Idempotence is the stability of image codec to re-compression. At the first
glance, it is unrelated to perceptual image compression. However, we find that
theoretically: 1) Conditional generative model-based perceptual codec satisfies
idempotence; 2) Unconditional generative model with idempotence constraint is
equivalent to conditional generative codec. Based on this newfound equivalence,
we propose a new paradigm of perceptual image codec by inverting unconditional
generative model with idempotence constraints. Our codec is theoretically
equivalent to conditional generative codec, and it does not require training
new models. Instead, it only requires a pre-trained mean-square-error codec and
unconditional generative model. Empirically, we show that our proposed approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as HiFiC and ILLM, in terms of
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). The source code is provided in

<p class="mathjax">Phase imaging is widely used in biomedical imaging, sensing, and material
characterization, among other fields. However, direct imaging of phase objects
with subwavelength resolution remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate
subwavelength imaging of phase and amplitude objects based on all-optical
diffractive encoding and decoding. To resolve subwavelength features of an
object, the diffractive imager uses a thin, high-index solid-immersion layer to
transmit high-frequency information of the object to a spatially-optimized
diffractive encoder, which converts/encodes high-frequency information of the
input into low-frequency spatial modes for transmission through air. The
subsequent diffractive decoder layers (in air) are jointly designed with the
encoder using deep-learning-based optimization, and communicate with the
encoder layer to create magnified images of input objects at its output,
revealing subwavelength features that would otherwise be washed away due to
diffraction limit. We demonstrate that this all-optical collaboration between a
diffractive solid-immersion encoder and the following decoder layers in air can
resolve subwavelength phase and amplitude features of input objects in a highly
compact design. To experimentally demonstrate its proof-of-concept, we used
terahertz radiation and developed a fabrication method for creating monolithic
multi-layer diffractive processors. Through these monolithically fabricated
diffractive encoder-decoder pairs, we demonstrated phase-to-intensity
transformations and all-optically reconstructed subwavelength phase features of
input objects by directly transforming them into magnified intensity features
at the output. This solid-immersion-based diffractive imager, with its compact
and cost-effective design, can find wide-ranging applications in bioimaging,
endoscopy, sensing and materials characterization.

<p class="mathjax">In a previous paper, we developed a new particle-in-cell method for the
Vlasov-Maxwell system in which the electromagnetic fields and the equations of
motion for the particles were cast in terms of scalar and vector potentials
through a Hamiltonian formulation. This paper extends this new class of methods
by focusing on the enforcement the Lorenz gauge condition in both exact and
approximate forms using co-located meshes. A time-consistency property of the
proposed field solver for the vector potential form of Maxwell's equations is
established, which is shown to preserve the equivalence between the
semi-discrete Lorenz gauge condition and the analogous semi-discrete continuity
equation. Using this property, we present three methods to enforce a
semi-discrete gauge condition. The first method introduces an update for the
continuity equation that is consistent with the discretization of the Lorenz
gauge condition. The second approach we propose enforces a semi-discrete
continuity equation using the boundary integral solution to the field
equations. The third approach introduces a gauge correcting method that makes
direct use of the gauge condition to modify the scalar potential and uses local
maps for both the charge and current densities. The vector potential coming
from the current density is taken to be exact, and using the Lorenz gauge, we
compute a correction to the scalar potential that makes the two potentials
satisfy the gauge condition. We demonstrate two of the proposed methods in the
context of periodic domains. Problems defined on bounded domains, including
those with complex geometric features remain an ongoing effort. However, this
work shows that it is possible to design computationally efficient methods that
can effectively enforce the Lorenz gauge condition in an non-staggered PIC
formulation.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum cryptography is the study of delivering secret communications across
a quantum channel. Recently, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has been recognized
as the most important breakthrough in quantum cryptography. This process
facilitates two distant parties to share secure communications based on
physical laws. The BB84 protocol was developed in 1984 and remains the most
widely used among BB92, Ekert91, COW, and SARG04 protocols. However the
practical security of QKD with imperfect devices have been widely discussed,
and there are many ways to guarantee that generated key by QKD still provides
unconditional security. This paper proposed a novel method that allows users to
communicate while generating the secure keys as well as securing the
transmission without any leakage of the data. In this approach sender will
never reveal her basis, hence neither the receiver nor the intruder will get
knowledge of the fundamental basis.Further to detect Eve, polynomial
interpolation is also used as a key verification technique. In order to fully
utilize the quantum computing capabilities provided by IBM quantum computers,
the protocol is executed using the Qiskit backend for 45 qubits. This article
discusses a plot of % error against alpha (strength of eavesdropping). As a
result, different types of noise have been included, and the success
probability of the desired key bits has been determined. Furthermore, the
success probability under depolarizing noise is explained for different qubit
counts.Last but not least, even when the applied noise is increased to maximum
capacity, a 50% probability of successful key generation is still observed in
an experiment.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised multimodal change detection is pivotal for time-sensitive tasks
and comprehensive multi-temporal Earth monitoring. In this study, we explore
unsupervised multimodal change detection between two key remote sensing data
sources: optical high-resolution imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.
Specifically, we propose to utilize the vision foundation model Segmentation
Anything Model (SAM), for addressing our task. Leveraging SAM's exceptional
zero-shot transfer capability, high-quality segmentation maps of optical images
can be obtained. Thus, we can directly compare these two heterogeneous data
forms in the so-called segmentation domain. We then introduce two strategies
for guiding SAM's segmentation process: the 'no-prompt' and 'box/mask prompt'
methods. The two strategies are designed to detect land-cover changes in
general scenarios and to identify new land-cover objects within existing
backgrounds, respectively. Experimental results on three datasets indicate that
the proposed approach can achieve more competitive results compared to
representative unsupervised multimodal change detection methods.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by the concept of fault tolerance quantum computation, this article
proposes a framework dubbed Exact Homomorphic Encryption, EHE, enabling exact
computations on encrypted data without the need for pre-decryption. The
introduction of quantum gates is a critical step in constructing the message
encryption and the computation encryption within the framework. Of significance
is that both encryptions are respectively accomplished in a multivariate
polynomial set generated by quantum gates. Two fundamental traits of quantum
gates, the invertibility and the noncommutativity, establish the success of
EHE. The employment of invertible gates allows exact decryptions for both an
encrypted message and encrypted computation. The encrypted computation is exact
as well because its encryption transformation is conducted with invertible
gates. The second trait of noncommutativity among applied quantum gates brings
forth the security for the two encryptions. In the message encryption, a
plaintext is encoded into a ciphertext via a polynomial set generated by a
product of noncommuting gates randomly chosen. Toward the computation
encryption, a desired operation is encoded into an encrypted polynomial set
generated by another product of noncommuting gates. The encrypted computation
is then the evaluation of the encrypted polynomial set on the ciphertext and is
referred to as the cryptovaluation. EHE is not only attainable on quantum
computers, but also straightforwardly realizable on traditional computing
environments. Surpassing the standard security 2^128 of quantum resilience,
both the encryptions further reach a security greater than the suggested
threshold 2^1024 and are characterized as hyper quantum-resilient. Thanks to
the two essential traits of quantum gates, this framework can be regarded as
the initial tangible manifestation of the concept noncommutative cryptography.

<p class="mathjax">Open sets are central to mathematics, especially analysis and topology, in
ways few notions are. In most, if not all, computational approaches to
mathematics, open sets are only studied indirectly via their 'codes' or
'representations'. In this paper, we study how hard it is to compute, given an
arbitrary open set of reals, the most common representation, i.e. a countable
set of open intervals. We work in Kleene's higher-order computability theory,
which was historically based on the S1-S9 schemes and which now has an
intuitive lambda calculus formulation due to the authors. We establish many
computational equivalences between on one hand the 'structure' functional that
converts open sets to the aforementioned representation, and on the other hand
functionals arising from mainstream mathematics, like basic properties of
semi-continuous functions, the Urysohn lemma, and the Tietze extension theorem.
We also compare these functionals to known operations on regulated and bounded
variation functions, and the Lebesgue measure restricted to closed sets. We
obtain a number of natural computational equivalences for the latter involving
theorems from mainstream mathematics.

<p class="mathjax">Rapid advances in quantum computing technology lead to an increasing need for
software simulators that enable both algorithm design and the validation of
results obtained from quantum hardware. This includes calculations that aim at
probing regimes of quantum advantage, where a quantum computer outperforms a
classical computer in the same task. High performance computing (HPC) platforms
play a crucial role as today's quantum devices already reach beyond the limits
of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the
individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so
far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable
of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We
develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation
packages on a local HPC cluster using different parallelisation capabilities,
and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic
quantum computing tasks. Our results can help finding the right package for a
given simulation task and lay the foundation for a systematic community effort
to benchmark and validate upcoming versions of existing and also newly
developed simulation packages.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is to simulate
quantum mechanical systems and deliver an advantage to classical computation by
leveraging their inherent quantum behaviour. In this work, we present a new
approach to achieve a noise tolerant Hamiltonian simulation algorithm for
ground state energy estimation which also surmounts stochastic limitations most
of its counterparts face. This algorithm is based on an adaptive set of fuzzy
bisection searches to estimate the ground state energy digit by digit that can
get to any arbitrary target precision. It builds upon the Quantum Eigenvalue
Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) algorithm and it delivers good
approximations in simulations with quantum depolarizing probability up to 1e-3,
particularly for the Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM). We ran simulations
with different system Hamiltonians, system sizes and time evolution encoding
methods on IBM Qiskit and we demonstrate the key results in this work, as well
as compare the performance with other existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of efficiently simulating stochastic models of
chemical kinetics. The Gillespie Stochastic Simulation algorithm (SSA) is often
used to simulate these models, however, in many scenarios of interest, the
computational cost quickly becomes prohibitive. This is further exasperated in
the Bayesian inference context when estimating parameters of chemical models,
as the intractability of the likelihood requires multiple simulations of the
underlying system. To deal with issues of computational complexity in this
paper, we propose a novel hybrid $\tau$-leap algorithm for simulating
well-mixed chemical systems. In particular, the algorithm uses $\tau$-leap when
appropriate (high population densities), and SSA when necessary (low population
densities, when discrete effects become non-negligible). In the intermediate
regime, a combination of the two methods, which leverages the properties of the
underlying Poisson formulation, is employed. As illustrated through a number of
numerical experiments the hybrid $\tau$ offers significant computational
savings when compared to SSA without however sacrificing the overall accuracy.
This feature is particularly welcomed in the Bayesian inference context, as it
allows for parameter estimation of stochastic chemical kinetics at reduced
computational cost.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the replication of experiments by Billock and Tsou
[PNAS, 2007] using the controllability of neural fields of Amari-type modelling
the cortical activity in the primary visual cortex (V1), focusing on a regular
funnel pattern localised in the fovea or the peripheral visual field. The aim
is to understand and model the visual phenomena observed in these experiments,
emphasising their nonlinear nature. The study involves designing sensory inputs
simulating the visual stimuli from Billock and Tsou's experiments. The
after-images induced by these inputs are then theoretically and numerically
studied to determine their capacity to replicate the experimentally observed
visual effects. A key aspect of this research is investigating the effects
induced by the nonlinear nature of neural responses. In particular, by
highlighting the importance of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the
emergence of certain visual phenomena, this study suggests that an interplay of
both types of neuronal activities plays an essential role in visual processes,
challenging the assumption that the latter is mainly driven by excitatory
activities alone.

the effective dimension. The new quantity provably bounds the generalization
error under mild assumptions on the model. Furthermore, simulations on standard

approximate 2sED from below through a layerwise iterative approach, which
allows us to tackle deep learning models with a large number of parameters.
Simulation results suggest that the approximation is good for different

<p class="mathjax">We consider a queueing model of a battery swapping and charging station
(BSCS) for electric vehicles. We describe the dynamics of the model by a system
of recurrence equations that involve random variables, and define a performance
measure for the model as the mean operation cycle time of the station.
Furthermore, the system of equations is represented in terms of tropical
algebra in vector form as an implicit linear state dynamic equation. The
performance measure takes the form of the mean growth rate of the state vector
(the Lyapunov exponent). By applying methods and techniques of tropical
algebra, we first transform the implicit equation into an explicit one with a
state transition matrix with random entries, and then obtain the Lyapunov
exponent as the limit of the expected value of norm of matrix products. We
discuss application of the obtained result to evaluate the performance of one
BSCS, and to find optimal distribution of batteries between stations in a
network of BSCSs.

for some fixed $k,\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\cup \{\infty\}$. We give a full

<p class="mathjax">New solutions for problems in optimal scheduling of activities in a project
under temporal constraints are developed in the framework of tropical algebra,
which deals with the theory and application of algebraic systems with
idempotent operations. We start with a constrained tropical optimization
problem that has an objective function represented as a vector form given by an
arbitrary matrix, and that can be solved analytically in a closed but somewhat
complicated form. We examine a special case of the problem when the objective
function is given by a matrix of unit rank, and show that the solution can be
sufficiently refined in this case, which results in an essentially simplified
analytical form and reduced computational complexity of the solution. We
exploit the obtained result to find complete solutions of project scheduling
problems to minimize the project makespan and the maximum absolute deviation of
start times of activities under temporal constraints. The constraint under
consideration include ``start-start'', ``start-finish'' and ``finish-start''
precedence relations, release times, release deadlines and completion deadlines
for activities. As an application, we consider optimal scheduling problems of a
vaccination project in a medical centre.

<p class="mathjax">Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally
challenging, as the simulation cost exponentially increases with the system
size. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome
this bottleneck. Most efforts recently have been spent on determining the
ground states of chemical systems. Hardness results and the lack of efficient
heuristics for initial-state generation sheds doubt on the feasibility. Here we
propose an inherently efficient approach for solving chemical simulation
problems, meaning it requires quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in
relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our
approach finds good initial states by assembling initial states for dynamical
simulation in a scattering tree. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical
interest that can be measured based on quantum simulation, e.g. of a reaction,
succeeding the initial state preparation.

<p class="mathjax">Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems, with their portability, present
a promising avenue for direct point-of-care medical imaging, particularly in
critical scenarios such as acute stroke assessment. However, the integration of
CBCT into clinical workflows faces challenges, primarily linked to long scan
duration resulting in patient motion during scanning and leading to image
quality degradation in the reconstructed volumes. This paper introduces a novel
approach to CBCT motion estimation using a gradient-based optimization
algorithm, which leverages generalized derivatives of the backprojection
operator for cone-beam CT geometries. Building on that, a fully differentiable
target function is formulated which grades the quality of the current motion
estimate in reconstruction space. We drastically accelerate motion estimation
yielding a 19-fold speed-up compared to existing methods. Additionally, we
investigate the architecture of networks used for quality metric regression and
propose predicting voxel-wise quality maps, favoring autoencoder-like
architectures over contracting ones. This modification improves gradient flow,
leading to more accurate motion estimation. The presented method is evaluated
through realistic experiments on head anatomy. It achieves a reduction in
reprojection error from an initial average of 3mm to 0.61mm after motion
compensation and consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing approaches. The analytic Jacobian for the backprojection operation,
which is at the core of the proposed method, is made publicly available. In
summary, this paper contributes to the advancement of CBCT integration into
clinical workflows by proposing a robust motion estimation approach that
enhances efficiency and accuracy, addressing critical challenges in
time-sensitive scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">In the design of traffic monitoring solutions for optimizing the urban
mobility infrastructure, acoustic vehicle counting models have received
attention due to their cost effectiveness and energy efficiency. Although deep
learning has proven effective for visual traffic monitoring, its use has not
been thoroughly investigated in the audio domain, likely due to real-world data
scarcity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to acoustic vehicle
counting by developing: i) a traffic noise simulation framework to synthesize
realistic vehicle pass-by events; ii) a strategy to mix synthetic and real data
to train a deep-learning model for traffic counting. The proposed system is
capable of simultaneously counting cars and commercial vehicles driving on a
two-lane road, and identifying their direction of travel under moderate traffic
density conditions. With only 24 hours of labeled real-world traffic noise, we
are able to improve counting accuracy on real-world data from $63\%$ to $88\%$
for cars and from $86\%$ to $94\%$ for commercial vehicles.

<p class="mathjax">We derive the strong spatial mixing property for the general 2-spin system
from zero-free regions of its partition function. We view the partition
function of the 2-spin system as a multivariate function over three complex
parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of
$\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. As long as the
zero-free region contains a positive point and it is a complex neighborhood of
$\lambda=0$ when fixing $\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{C}$, or a complex
neighborhood of $\beta\gamma=1$ when fixing $\beta, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ or
$\gamma, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ respectively, we are able to show that the
corresponding 2-spin system exhibits strong spatial mixing on such a region.
The underlying graphs of the 2-spin system are not necessarily of bounded
degree, while are required to include graphs with pinned vertices. We prove
this result by establishing a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin
system on trees and using certain tools from complex analysis.
<br />To our best knowledge, our result is general enough to turn all currently
known zero-free regions of the partition function of the 2-spin system where
pinned vertices are allowed into the strong spatial mixing property. Moreover,
we extend our result to obtain strong spatial mixing for the ferromagnetic
Ising model (even with non-uniform external fields) from the celebrated
Lee-Yang circle theorem.

<p class="mathjax">Clinicians compare breast DCE-MRI after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with
pre-treatment scans to evaluate the response to NAC. Clinical evidence supports
that accurate longitudinal deformable registration without deforming treated
tumor regions is key to quantifying tumor changes. We propose a conditional
pyramid registration network based on unsupervised keypoint detection and
selective volume-preserving to quantify changes over time. In this approach, we
extract the structural and the abnormal keypoints from DCE-MRI, apply the
structural keypoints for the registration algorithm to restrict large
deformation, and employ volume-preserving loss based on abnormal keypoints to
keep the volume of the tumor unchanged after registration. We use a clinical
dataset with 1630 MRI scans from 314 patients treated with NAC. The results
demonstrate that our method registers with better performance and better volume
preservation of the tumors. Furthermore, a local-global-combining biomarker
based on the proposed method achieves high accuracy in pathological complete
response (pCR) prediction, indicating that predictive information exists
outside tumor regions. The biomarkers could potentially be used to avoid
unnecessary surgeries for certain patients. It may be valuable for clinicians
and/or computer systems to conduct follow-up tumor segmentation and response
prediction on images registered by our method. Our code is available on

<p class="mathjax">Two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) is among the most general
frameworks for iterative stochastic algorithms. This includes well-known
stochastic optimization methods such as SGD variants and those designed for
bilevel or minimax problems, as well as reinforcement learning like the family
of gradient-based temporal difference (GTD) algorithms. In this paper, we
conduct an in-depth asymptotic analysis of TTSA under controlled Markovian
noise via central limit theorem (CLT), uncovering the coupled dynamics of TTSA
influenced by the underlying Markov chain, which has not been addressed by
previous CLT results of TTSA only with Martingale difference noise. Building
upon our CLT, we expand its application horizon of efficient sampling
strategies from vanilla SGD to a wider TTSA context in distributed learning,
thus broadening the scope of Hu et al. (2022). In addition, we leverage our CLT
result to deduce the statistical properties of GTD algorithms with nonlinear
function approximation using Markovian samples and show their identical
asymptotic performance, a perspective not evident from current finite-time
bounds.

<p class="mathjax">Uncertainty quantification for estimation through stochastic optimization
solutions in an online setting has gained popularity recently. This paper
introduces a novel inference method focused on constructing confidence
intervals with efficient computation and fast convergence to the nominal level.
Specifically, we propose to use a small number of independent multi-runs to
acquire distribution information and construct a t-based confidence interval.
Our method requires minimal additional computation and memory beyond the
standard updating of estimates, making the inference process almost cost-free.
We provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee for the confidence interval,
demonstrating that the coverage is approximately exact with an explicit
convergence rate and allowing for high confidence level inference. In
particular, a new Gaussian approximation result is developed for the online
estimators to characterize the coverage properties of our confidence intervals
in terms of relative errors. Additionally, our method also allows for
leveraging parallel computing to further accelerate calculations using multiple
cores. It is easy to implement and can be integrated with existing stochastic
algorithms without the need for complicated modifications.

<p class="mathjax">In existing models and embedding methods of networked systems, node features
describing their qualities are usually overlooked in favor of focusing solely
on node connectivity. This study introduces $FiD$-Mercator, a model-based
ultra-low dimensional reduction technique that integrates node features with
network structure to create $D$-dimensional maps of complex networks in a
hyperbolic space. This embedding method efficiently uses features as an initial
condition, guiding the search of nodes' coordinates towards an optimal
solution. The research reveals that downstream task performance improves with
the correlation between network connectivity and features, emphasizing the
importance of such correlation for enhancing the description and predictability
of real networks. Simultaneously, hyperbolic embedding's ability to reproduce
local network properties remains unaffected by the inclusion of features. The
findings highlight the necessity for developing novel network embedding
techniques capable of exploiting such correlations to optimize both network
structure and feature association jointly in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Designing performant and noise-robust circuits for Quantum Machine Learning
(QML) is challenging -- the design space scales exponentially with circuit
size, and there are few well-supported guiding principles for QML circuit
design. Although recent Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) methods attempt to search
for performant QML circuits that are also robust to hardware noise, they
directly adopt designs from classical Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that are
misaligned with the unique constraints of quantum hardware, resulting in high
search overheads and severe performance bottlenecks.
<br />We present \'Eliv\'agar, a novel resource-efficient, noise-guided QCS
framework. \'Eliv\'agar innovates in all three major aspects of QCS -- search
space, search algorithm and candidate evaluation strategy -- to address the
design flaws in current classically-inspired QCS methods. \'Eliv\'agar achieves
hardware-efficiency and avoids an expensive circuit-mapping co-search via
noise- and device topology-aware candidate generation. By introducing two
cheap-to-compute predictors, Clifford noise resilience and Representational
capacity, \'Eliv\'agar decouples the evaluation of noise robustness and
performance, enabling early rejection of low-fidelity circuits and reducing
circuit evaluation costs. Due to its resource-efficiency, \'Eliv\'agar can
further search for data embeddings, significantly improving performance.
<br />Based on a comprehensive evaluation of \'Eliv\'agar on 12 real quantum
devices and 9 QML applications, \'Eliv\'agar achieves 5.3% higher accuracy and
a 271$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art QCS methods.
