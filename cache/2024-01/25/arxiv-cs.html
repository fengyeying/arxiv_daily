<p class="mathjax">Femicide refers to the killing of a female victim, often perpetrated by an
intimate partner or family member, and is also associated with gender-based
violence. Studies have shown that there is a pattern of escalating violence
leading up to these killings, highlighting the potential for prevention if the
level of danger to the victim can be assessed. Machine learning offers a
promising approach to address this challenge by predicting risk levels based on
textual descriptions of the violence. In this study, we employed the Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) technique to identify patterns of behavior in Brazilian
police reports preceding femicides. Our first objective was to classify the
content of these reports as indicating either a lower or higher risk of the
victim being murdered, achieving an accuracy of 66%. In the second approach, we
developed a model to predict the next action a victim might experience within a
sequence of patterned events. Both approaches contribute to the understanding
and assessment of the risks associated with domestic violence, providing
authorities with valuable insights to protect women and prevent situations from
escalating.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in machine learning and natural language processing have
led to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) as a valuable tool
in the healthcare industry. Using large language models (LLMs) as
conversational agents or chatbots has the potential to assist doctors in
diagnosing patients, detecting early symptoms of diseases, and providing health
advice to patients. This paper focuses on the role of chatbots in healthcare
and explores the use of avatars to make AI interactions more appealing to
patients. A framework of a general-purpose AI avatar application is
demonstrated by using a three-category prompt dictionary and prompt improvement
mechanism. A two-phase approach is suggested to fine-tune a general-purpose AI
language model and create different AI avatars to discuss medical issues with
users. Prompt engineering enhances the chatbot's conversational abilities and
personality traits, fostering a more human-like interaction with patients.
Ultimately, the injection of personality into the chatbot could potentially
increase patient engagement. Future directions for research include
investigating ways to improve chatbots' understanding of context and ensuring
the accuracy of their outputs through fine-tuning with specialized medical data
sets.

<p class="mathjax">The explosive and widespread growth of data necessitates the use of text
classification to extract crucial information from vast amounts of data.
Consequently, there has been a surge of research in both classical and deep
learning text classification methods. Despite the numerous methods proposed in
the literature, there is still a pressing need for a comprehensive and
up-to-date survey. Existing survey papers categorize algorithms for text
classification into broad classes, which can lead to the misclassification of
unrelated algorithms and incorrect assessments of their qualities and behaviors
using the same metrics. To address these limitations, our paper introduces a
novel methodological taxonomy that classifies algorithms hierarchically into
fine-grained classes and specific techniques. The taxonomy includes methodology
categories, methodology techniques, and methodology sub-techniques. Our study
is the first survey to utilize this methodological taxonomy for classifying
algorithms for text classification. Furthermore, our study also conducts
empirical evaluation and experimental comparisons and rankings of different
algorithms that employ the same specific sub-technique, different
sub-techniques within the same technique, different techniques within the same
category, and categories

<p class="mathjax">This study is a pioneering endeavor to investigate the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in addressing conceptual questions within the domain of
mechanical engineering with a focus on mechanics. Our examination involves a
manually crafted exam encompassing 126 multiple-choice questions, spanning
various aspects of mechanics courses, including Fluid Mechanics, Mechanical
Vibration, Engineering Statics and Dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, Theory of
Elasticity, and Continuum Mechanics. Three LLMs, including ChatGPT (GPT-3.5),
ChatGPT (GPT-4), and Claude (Claude-2.1), were subjected to evaluation against
engineering faculties and students with or without mechanical engineering
background. The findings reveal GPT-4's superior performance over the other two
LLMs and human cohorts in answering questions across various mechanics topics,
except for Continuum Mechanics. This signals the potential future improvements
for GPT models in handling symbolic calculations and tensor analyses. The
performances of LLMs were all significantly improved with explanations prompted
prior to direct responses, underscoring the crucial role of prompt engineering.
Interestingly, GPT-3.5 demonstrates improved performance with prompts covering
a broader domain, while GPT-4 excels with prompts focusing on specific
subjects. Finally, GPT-4 exhibits notable advancements in mitigating input
bias, as evidenced by guessing preferences for humans. This study unveils the
substantial potential of LLMs as highly knowledgeable assistants in both
mechanical pedagogy and scientific research.

<p class="mathjax">Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are data-driven Artificial Intelligence
(AI) systems that output polarity and emotional intensity when given a piece of
text as input. Like other AIs, SASs are also known to have unstable behavior
when subjected to changes in data which can make it problematic to trust out of
concerns like bias when AI works with humans and data has protected attributes
like gender, race, and age. Recently, an approach was introduced to assess SASs
in a blackbox setting without training data or code, and rating them for bias
using synthetic English data. We augment it by introducing two human-generated
chatbot datasets and also consider a round-trip setting of translating the data
from one language to the same through an intermediate language. We find that
these settings show SASs performance in a more realistic light. Specifically,
we find that rating SASs on the chatbot data showed more bias compared to the
synthetic data, and round-tripping using Spanish and Danish as intermediate
languages reduces the bias (up to 68% reduction) in human-generated data while,
in synthetic data, it takes a surprising turn by increasing the bias! Our
findings will help researchers and practitioners refine their SAS testing
strategies and foster trust as SASs are considered part of more
mission-critical applications for global use.

<p class="mathjax">Public opinion surveys are vital for informing democratic decision-making,
but responding to rapidly changing information environments and measuring
beliefs within niche communities can be challenging for traditional survey
methods. This paper introduces a crowdsourced adaptive survey methodology
(CSAS) that unites advances in natural language processing and adaptive
algorithms to generate question banks that evolve with user input. The CSAS
method converts open-ended text provided by participants into Likert-style
items and applies a multi-armed bandit algorithm to determine user-provided
questions that should be prioritized in the survey. The method's adaptive
nature allows for the exploration of new survey questions, while imposing
minimal costs in survey length. Applications in the domains of Latino
information environments and issue importance showcase CSAS's ability to
identify claims or issues that might otherwise be difficult to track using
standard approaches. I conclude by discussing the method's potential for
studying topics where participant-generated content might improve our
understanding of public opinion.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays a crucial role in enabling
dialogue systems to effectively respond to user requests. The emotions in a
conversation can be identified by the representations from various modalities,
such as audio, visual, and text. However, due to the weak contribution of
non-verbal modalities to recognize emotions, multimodal ERC has always been
considered a challenging task. In this paper, we propose Teacher-leading
Multimodal fusion network for ERC (TelME). TelME incorporates cross-modal
knowledge distillation to transfer information from a language model acting as
the teacher to the non-verbal students, thereby optimizing the efficacy of the
weak modalities. We then combine multimodal features using a shifting fusion
approach in which student networks support the teacher. TelME achieves
state-of-the-art performance in MELD, a multi-speaker conversation dataset for
ERC. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our components through
additional experiments.

<p class="mathjax">This study harnesses state-of-the-art AI technology for chronic disease
management, specifically in detecting various mental disorders through
user-generated textual content. Existing studies typically rely on fully
supervised machine learning, which presents challenges such as the
labor-intensive manual process of annotating extensive training data for each
disease and the need to design specialized deep learning architectures for each
problem. To address such challenges, we propose a novel framework that
leverages advanced AI techniques, including large language models and
multi-prompt engineering. Specifically, we address two key technical challenges
in data-driven chronic disease management: (1) developing personalized prompts
to represent each user's uniqueness and (2) incorporating medical knowledge
into prompts to provide context for chronic disease detection, instruct
learning objectives, and operationalize prediction goals. We evaluate our
method using four mental disorders, which are prevalent chronic diseases
worldwide, as research cases. On the depression detection task, our method (F1
= 0.975~0.978) significantly outperforms traditional supervised learning
paradigms, including feature engineering (F1 = 0.760) and architecture
engineering (F1 = 0.756). Meanwhile, our approach demonstrates success in
few-shot learning, i.e., requiring only a minimal number of training examples
to detect chronic diseases based on user-generated textual content (i.e., only
2, 10, or 100 subjects). Moreover, our method can be generalized to other
mental disorder detection tasks, including anorexia, pathological gambling, and
self-harm (F1 = 0.919~0.978).

<p class="mathjax">Gun violence is a pressing and growing human rights issue that affects nearly
every dimension of the social fabric, from healthcare and education to
psychology and the economy. Reliable data on firearm events is paramount to
developing more effective public policy and emergency responses. However, the
lack of comprehensive databases and the risks of in-person surveys prevent
human rights organizations from collecting needed data in most countries. Here,
we partner with a Brazilian human rights organization to conduct a systematic
evaluation of language models to assist with monitoring real-world firearm
events from social media data. We propose a fine-tuned BERT-based model trained
on Twitter (now X) texts to distinguish gun violence reports from ordinary
Portuguese texts. Our model achieves a high AUC score of 0.97. We then
incorporate our model into a web application and test it in a live
intervention. We study and interview Brazilian analysts who continuously
fact-check social media texts to identify new gun violence events. Qualitative
assessments show that our solution helped all analysts use their time more
efficiently and expanded their search capacities. Quantitative assessments show
that the use of our model was associated with more analysts' interactions with
online users reporting gun violence. Taken together, our findings suggest that
modern Natural Language Processing techniques can help support the work of
human rights organizations.

<p class="mathjax">Topic modelling is a text mining technique for identifying salient themes
from a number of documents. The output is commonly a set of topics consisting
of isolated tokens that often co-occur in such documents. Manual effort is
often associated with interpreting a topic's description from such tokens.
However, from a human's perspective, such outputs may not adequately provide
enough information to infer the meaning of the topics; thus, their
interpretability is often inaccurately understood. Although several studies
have attempted to automatically extend topic descriptions as a means of
enhancing the interpretation of topic models, they rely on external language
sources that may become unavailable, must be kept up-to-date to generate
relevant results, and present privacy issues when training on or processing
data. This paper presents a novel approach towards extending the output of
traditional topic modelling methods beyond a list of isolated tokens. This
approach removes the dependence on external sources by using the textual data
itself by extracting high-scoring keywords and mapping them to the topic
model's token outputs. To measure the interpretability of the proposed outputs
against those of the traditional topic modelling approach, independent
annotators manually scored each output based on their quality and usefulness,
as well as the efficiency of the annotation task. The proposed approach
demonstrated higher quality and usefulness, as well as higher efficiency in the
annotation task, in comparison to the outputs of a traditional topic modelling
method, demonstrating an increase in their interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">The Mercator projection is sometimes confused with another mapping technique,
specifically the central cylindrical projection, which projects the Earth's
surface onto a cylinder tangent to the equator, as if a light source is at the
Earth's center. Accidentally, this misconception is rather close to a truth.
The only operation that the map needs is a free bending in a uniform
gravitational field if the map's material is dense and soft enough to produce a
catenary profile. The north and south edges of the map should be parallel and
placed in the same plane at the appropriate distance. In this case, the bent
map been projected onto this plane gives the Mercator projection. This property
is rather curious, since it allows to make such a sophisticated one-to-one
mapping as the Mercator projection using simple tools available in the
workroom.

<p class="mathjax">Although there has been significant advancement in the field of
speech-to-speech translation, conventional models still require
language-parallel speech data between the source and target languages for
training. In this paper, we introduce TranSentence, a novel speech-to-speech
translation without language-parallel speech data. To achieve this, we first
adopt a language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoding that captures the
semantic information of speech, irrespective of language. We then train our
model to generate speech based on the encoded embedding obtained from a
language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoder that is pre-trained with
various languages. With this method, despite training exclusively on the target
language's monolingual data, we can generate target language speech in the
inference stage using language-agnostic speech embedding from the source
language speech. Furthermore, we extend TranSentence to multilingual
speech-to-speech translation. The experimental results demonstrate that
TranSentence is superior to other models.

<p class="mathjax">Analyzing authors' sentiments in texts as a technique for identifying text
polarity can be practical and useful in various fields, including medicine and
dentistry. Currently, due to factors such as patients' limited knowledge about
their condition, difficulties in accessing specialist doctors, or fear of
illness, particularly in pandemic conditions, there might be a delay between
receiving a radiology report and consulting a doctor. In some cases, this delay
can pose significant risks to the patient, making timely decision-making
crucial. Having an automatic system that can inform patients about the
deterioration of their condition by analyzing the text of radiology reports
could greatly impact timely decision-making. In this study, a dataset
comprising 1,134 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) photo reports was
collected from the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Each case was
examined, and an expert labeled a severity level for the patient's condition on
each document. After preprocessing all the text data, a deep learning model
based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network architecture, known as CNN-LSTM, was developed to detect the severity
level of the patient's problem based on sentiment analysis in the radiologist's
report. The model's performance was evaluated on two datasets, each with two
and four classes, in both imbalanced and balanced scenarios. Finally, to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we compared its performance with
that of other classification models. The results, along with one-way ANOVA and
Tukey's test, indicated that our proposed model (CNN-LSTM) performed the best
according to precision, recall, and f-measure criteria. This suggests that it
can be a reliable model for estimating the severity of oral and dental
diseases, thereby assisting patients.

<p class="mathjax">Code-mixing, the blending of multiple languages within a single conversation,
introduces a distinctive challenge, particularly in the context of response
generation. Capturing the intricacies of code-mixing proves to be a formidable
task, given the wide-ranging variations influenced by individual speaking
styles and cultural backgrounds. In this study, we explore response generation
within code-mixed conversations. We introduce a novel approach centered on
harnessing the Big Five personality traits acquired in an unsupervised manner
from the conversations to bolster the performance of response generation. These
inferred personality attributes are seamlessly woven into the fabric of the
dialogue context, using a novel fusion mechanism, PA3. It uses an effective
two-step attention formulation to fuse the dialogue and personality
information. This fusion not only enhances the contextual relevance of
generated responses but also elevates the overall performance of the model. Our
experimental results, grounded in a dataset comprising of multi-party
Hindi-English code-mix conversations, highlight the substantial advantages
offered by personality-infused models over their conventional counterparts.
This is evident in the increase observed in ROUGE and BLUE scores for the
response generation task when the identified personality is seamlessly
integrated into the dialogue context. Qualitative assessment for personality
identification and response generation aligns well with our quantitative
results.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a data source for opioid
research. Opioid use disorder is known to be under-coded as a diagnosis, yet
problematic opioid use can be documented in clinical notes.
<br />Objectives: Our goals were 1) to identify problematic opioid use from a full
range of clinical notes; and 2) to compare the characteristics of patients
identified as having problematic opioid use, exclusively documented in clinical
notes, to those having documented ICD opioid use disorder diagnostic codes.
<br />Materials and Methods: We developed and applied a natural language processing
(NLP) tool to the clinical notes of a patient cohort (n=222,371) from two
Veteran Affairs service regions to identify patients with problematic opioid
use. We also used a set of ICD diagnostic codes to identify patients with
opioid use disorder from the same cohort. We compared the demographic and
clinical characteristics of patients identified only through NLP, to those of
patients identified through ICD codes.
<br />Results: NLP exclusively identified 57,331 patients; 6,997 patients had
positive ICD code identifications. Patients exclusively identified through NLP
were more likely to be women. Those identified through ICD codes were more
likely to be male, younger, have concurrent benzodiazepine prescriptions, more
comorbidities, more care encounters, and less likely to be married. Patients in
the NLP and ICD groups had substantially elevated comorbidity levels compared
to patients not documented as experiencing problematic opioid use.
<br />Conclusions: NLP is a feasible approach for identifying problematic opioid
use not otherwise recorded by ICD codes. Clinicians may be reluctant to code
for opioid use disorder. It is therefore incumbent on the healthcare team to
search for documentation of opioid concerns within clinical notes.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, knowledge graph completion (KGC) models based on pre-trained
language model (PLM) have shown promising results. However, the large number of
parameters and high computational cost of PLM models pose challenges for their
application in downstream tasks. This paper proposes a progressive distillation
method based on masked generation features for KGC task, aiming to
significantly reduce the complexity of pre-trained models. Specifically, we
perform pre-distillation on PLM to obtain high-quality teacher models, and
compress the PLM network to obtain multi-grade student models. However,
traditional feature distillation suffers from the limitation of having a single
representation of information in teacher models. To solve this problem, we
propose masked generation of teacher-student features, which contain richer
representation information. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in
representation ability between teacher and student. Therefore, we design a
progressive distillation method to distill student models at each grade level,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer from teachers to students. The
experimental results demonstrate that the model in the pre-distillation stage
surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in the
progressive distillation stage, the model significantly reduces the model
parameters while maintaining a certain level of performance. Specifically, the
model parameters of the lower-grade student model are reduced by 56.7\%
compared to the baseline.

<p class="mathjax">The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific medicine,
particularly for managing complex diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA), remains
largely unexplored. This study focused on evaluating and enhancing the clinical
capabilities of LLMs in specific domains, using osteoarthritis (OA) management
as a case study. A domain specific benchmark framework was developed, which
evaluate LLMs across a spectrum from domain-specific knowledge to clinical
applications in real-world clinical scenarios. DocOA, a specialized LLM
tailored for OA management that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
and instruction prompts, was developed. The study compared the performance of
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and a specialized assistant, DocOA, using objective and human
evaluations. Results showed that general LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were less
effective in the specialized domain of OA management, particularly in providing
personalized treatment recommendations. However, DocOA showed significant
improvements. This study introduces a novel benchmark framework which assesses
the domain-specific abilities of LLMs in multiple aspects, highlights the
limitations of generalized LLMs in clinical contexts, and demonstrates the
potential of tailored approaches for developing domain-specific medical LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Content creation and image editing can benefit from flexible user controls. A
common intermediate representation for conditional image generation is a
semantic map, that has information of objects present in the image. When
compared to raw RGB pixels, the modification of semantic map is much easier.
One can take a semantic map and easily modify the map to selectively insert,
remove, or replace objects in the map. The method proposed in this paper takes
in the modified semantic map and alter the original image in accordance to the
modified map. The method leverages traditional pre-trained image-to-image
translation GANs, such as CycleGAN or Pix2Pix GAN, that are fine-tuned on a
limited dataset of reference images associated with the semantic maps. We
discuss the qualitative and quantitative performance of our technique to
illustrate its capacity and possible applications in the fields of image
forgery and image editing. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed image forgery technique in thwarting the numerous deep learning-based
image forensic techniques, highlighting the urgent need to develop robust and
generalizable image forensic tools in the fight against the spread of fake
media.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, the need for causal discovery is ubiquitous. A better understanding
of not just the stochastic dependencies between parts of a system, but also the
actual cause-effect relations, is essential for all parts of science. Thus, the
need for reliable methods to detect causal directions is growing constantly. In
the last 50 years, many causal discovery algorithms have emerged, but most of
them are applicable only under the assumption that the systems have no feedback
loops and that they are causally sufficient, i.e. that there are no unmeasured
subsystems that can affect multiple measured variables. This is unfortunate
since those restrictions can often not be presumed in practice. Feedback is an
integral feature of many processes, and real-world systems are rarely
completely isolated and fully measured. Fortunately, in recent years, several
techniques, that can cope with cyclic, causally insufficient systems, have been
developed. And with multiple methods available, a practical application of
those algorithms now requires knowledge of the respective strengths and
weaknesses. Here, we focus on the problem of causal discovery for sparse linear
models which are allowed to have cycles and hidden confounders. We have
prepared a comprehensive and thorough comparative study of four causal
discovery techniques: two versions of the LLC method [10] and two variants of
the ASP-based algorithm [11]. The evaluation investigates the performance of
those techniques for various experiments with multiple interventional setups
and different dataset sizes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel generative model, Collaborative Competitive
Agents (CCA), which leverages the capabilities of multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs) based agents to execute complex tasks. Drawing inspiration from
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the CCA system employs two equal-status
generator agents and a discriminator agent. The generators independently
process user instructions and generate results, while the discriminator
evaluates the outputs, and provides feedback for the generator agents to
further reflect and improve the generation results. Unlike the previous
generative model, our system can obtain the intermediate steps of generation.
This allows each generator agent to learn from other successful executions due
to its transparency, enabling a collaborative competition that enhances the
quality and robustness of the system's results. The primary focus of this study
is image editing, demonstrating the CCA's ability to handle intricate
instructions robustly. The paper's main contributions include the introduction
of a multi-agent-based generative model with controllable intermediate steps
and iterative optimization, a detailed examination of agent relationships, and
comprehensive experiments on image editing. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">H{\infty} control of nonlinear continuous-time system depends on the solution
of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, which has been proved impossible
to obtain a closed-form solution due to the nonlinearity of HJI equation. In
order to solve HJI equation, many iterative algorithms were proposed, and most
of the algorithms were essentially Newton method when the fixed-point equation
was constructed in a Banach space. Newton method is a local optimization
method, it has small convergence region and needs the initial guess to be
sufficiently close to the solution. Whereas damped Newton method enhances the
robustness with respect to initial condition and has larger convergence region.
In this paper, a novel reinforcement learning method which is named
{\alpha}-policy iteration ({\alpha}-PI) is introduced for solving HJI equation.
First, by constructing a damped Newton iteration operator equation, a
generalized Bellman equation (GBE) is obtained. The GBE is an extension of
bellman equation. And then, by iterating on the GBE, an on-policy {\alpha}-PI
reinforcement learning method without using knowledge regarding to the system
internal dynamics is proposed. Third, based on the on-policy {\alpha}-PI
reinforcement learning method, we develop an off-policy {\alpha}-PI
reinforcement learning method without requiring any knowledge of the system
dynamics. Finally, the neural-network based adaptive critic implementation
schemes of on-policy and off-policy {\alpha}-PI algorithms are derived
respectively, and the batch least-squares method is used for calculating the
weight parameters of neural networks. The effectiveness of the off-policy
{\alpha}-PI algorithm is verified through computer simulation.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel methodology for validating software product line (PL)
models by integrating Statistical Model Checking (SMC) with Process Mining
(PM). Our approach focuses on the feature-oriented language QFLan in the PL
engineering domain, allowing modeling of PLs with rich cross-tree and
quantitative constraints, as well as aspects of dynamic PLs like staged
configurations. This richness leads to models with infinite state-space,
requiring simulation-based analysis techniques like SMC. For instance, we
illustrate with a running example involving infinite state space. SMC involves
generating samples of system dynamics to estimate properties such as event
probabilities or expected values. On the other hand, PM uses data-driven
techniques on execution logs to identify and reason about the underlying
execution process. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, applying PM
techniques to SMC simulations' byproducts to enhance the utility of SMC
analyses. Typically, when SMC results are unexpected, modelers must determine
whether they stem from actual system characteristics or model bugs in a
black-box manner. We improve on this by using PM to provide a white-box
perspective on the observed system dynamics. Samples from SMC are fed into PM
tools, producing a compact graphical representation of observed dynamics. The
mined PM model is then transformed into a QFLan model, accessible to PL
engineers. Using two well-known PL models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
scalability of our methodology in pinpointing issues and suggesting fixes.
Additionally, we show its generality by applying it to the security domain.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional control theory-based methods require tailored engineering for
each system and constant fine-tuning. In power plant control, one often needs
to obtain a precise representation of the system dynamics and carefully design
the control scheme accordingly. Model-free Reinforcement learning (RL) has
emerged as a promising solution for control tasks due to its ability to learn
from trial-and-error interactions with the environment. It eliminates the need
for explicitly modeling the environment's dynamics, which is potentially
inaccurate. However, the direct imposition of state constraints in power plant
control raises challenges for standard RL methods. To address this, we propose
a chance-constrained RL algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization for
supervisory control. Our method employs Lagrangian relaxation to convert the
constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained objective, where
trainable Lagrange multipliers enforce the state constraints. Our approach
achieves the smallest distance of violation and violation rate in a load-follow
maneuver for an advanced Nuclear Power Plant design.

<p class="mathjax">Acquiring an accurate world model online for model-based reinforcement
learning (MBRL) is challenging due to data nonstationarity, which typically
causes catastrophic forgetting for neural networks (NNs). From the online
learning perspective, a Follow-The-Leader (FTL) world model is desirable, which
optimally fits all previous experiences at each round. Unfortunately, NN-based
models need re-training on all accumulated data at every interaction step to
achieve FTL, which is computationally expensive for lifelong agents. In this
paper, we revisit models that can achieve FTL with incremental updates.
Specifically, our world model is a linear regression model supported by
nonlinear random features. The linear part ensures efficient FTL update while
the nonlinear random feature empowers the fitting of complex environments. To
best trade off model capacity and computation efficiency, we introduce a
locality sensitive sparse encoding, which allows us to conduct efficient sparse
updates even with very high dimensional nonlinear features. We validate the
representation power of our encoding and verify that it allows efficient online
learning under data covariate shift. We also show, in the Dyna MBRL setting,
that our world models learned online using a single pass of trajectory data
either surpass or match the performance of deep world models trained with
replay and other continual learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the fundamental task of network exploration. A network is modeled
as a simple connected undirected n-node graph with unlabeled nodes, and all
ports at any node of degree d are arbitrarily numbered 0,.....,d-1. Each of two
identical mobile agents, initially situated at distinct nodes, has to visit all
nodes and stop. Agents execute the same deterministic algorithm and move in
synchronous rounds: in each round, an agent can either remain at the same node
or move to an adjacent node. Exploration must be collision-free: in every round
at most one agent can be at any node. We assume that agents have vision of
radius 2: an awake agent situated at a node v can see the subgraph induced by
all nodes at a distance at most 2 from v, sees all port numbers in this
subgraph, and the agents located at these nodes. Agents do not know the entire
graph but they know an upper bound n on its size. The time of an exploration is
the number of rounds since the wakeup of the later agent to the termination by
both agents. We show a collision-free exploration algorithm working in time
polynomial in n, for arbitrary graphs of size larger than 2. Moreover, we show
that if agents have only vision of radius 1, then collision-free exploration is
impossible, e.g., in any tree of diameter 2.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has exhibited outstanding performance in
various image segmentation tasks. Despite being trained with over a billion
masks, SAM faces challenges in mask prediction quality in numerous scenarios,
especially in real-world contexts. In this paper, we introduce a novel
prompt-driven adapter into SAM, namely Prompt Adapter Segment Anything Model
(PA-SAM), aiming to enhance the segmentation mask quality of the original SAM.
By exclusively training the prompt adapter, PA-SAM extracts detailed
information from images and optimizes the mask decoder feature at both sparse

produce high-quality masks. Experimental results demonstrate that our PA-SAM
outperforms other SAM-based methods in high-quality, zero-shot, and open-set
segmentation. We're making the source code and models available at

to refine using data from other agents. The goal of the marketplace is to
encourage participation for data sharing in the presence of such heterogeneity.
Our market design approach for data sharing focuses on interim utility balance,
where participants contribute and receive equitable utility from refinement of

<p class="mathjax">A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that arises naturally when
attribute-sharing among entities is considered. Although a hypergraph can be
converted into a graph by expanding its hyperedges into fully connected
subgraphs, going the reverse way is computationally complex and NP-complete. We
therefore hypothesize that a hypergraph contains more information than a graph.
In addition, it is more convenient to manipulate a hypergraph directly, rather
than expand it into a graph. An open problem in hypergraphs is how to
accurately and efficiently calculate their node distances. Estimating node
distances enables us to find a node's nearest neighbors, and perform label
propagation on hypergraphs using a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach based on random walks to achieve label
propagation on hypergraphs. We estimate node distances as the expected hitting
times of random walks. We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately
describe highly complex real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce
frustrated random walks (FRW) to better describe them. We further benchmark our
method against DeepWalk, and show that while the latter can achieve comparable
results, FRW has a distinct computational advantage in cases where the number
of targets is fairly small. For such cases, we show that FRW runs in
significantly shorter time than DeepWalk. Finally, we analyze the time
complexity of our method, and show that for large and sparse hypergraphs, the
complexity is approximately linear, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk
alternative.

<p class="mathjax">Visual sensing of environmental geometry allows robots to use artificial
potential fields to avoid sparse obstacles. Yet robots must further traverse
cluttered large obstacles for applications like search and rescue through
rubble and planetary exploration across Martain rocks. Recent studies
discovered that to traverse cluttered large obstacles, multi-legged insects and
insect-inspired robots make strenuous transitions across locomotor modes with
major changes in body orientation. When viewed on a potential energy landscape
resulting from locomotor-obstacle physical interaction, these are
barrier-crossing transitions across landscape basins. This potential energy
landscape approach may provide a modeling framework for cluttered large
obstacle traversal. Here, we take the next step toward this vision by testing
whether force sensing allows the reconstruction of the potential energy
landscape. We developed a cockroach-inspired, minimalistic robot capable of
sensing obstacle contact forces and torques around its body as it propelled
forward against a pair of cluttered grass-like beam obstacles. We performed
measurements over many traverses with systematically varied body orientations.
Despite the forces and torques not being fully conservative, they well-matched
the potential energy landscape gradients and the landscape reconstructed from
them well-matched ground truth. In addition, inspired by cockroach
observations, we found that robot head oscillation during traversal further
improved the accuracies of force sensing and landscape reconstruction. We still
need to study how to reconstruct landscape during a single traverse, as in
applications, robots have little chance to use multiple traverses to sample the
environment systematically and how to find landscape saddles for least-effort
transitions to traverse.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithmic theories of randomness can be related to theories of
probabilistic sequence prediction through the notion of a predictor, defined as
a function which supplies lower bounds on initial-segment probabilities of
infinite sequences. An infinite binary sequence $z$ is called unpredictable iff
its initial-segment "redundancy" $n+\log p(z(n))$ remains sufficiently low
relative to every effective predictor $p$. A predictor which maximizes the
initial-segment redundancy of a sequence is called optimal for that sequence.
It turns out that a sequence is random iff it is unpredictable. More generally,
a sequence is random relative to an arbitrary computable distribution iff the
distribution is itself an optimal predictor for the sequence. Here "random" can
be taken in the sense of Martin-L\"{o}f by using weak criteria of
effectiveness, or in the sense of Schnorr by using stronger criteria of
effectiveness. Under the weaker criteria of effectiveness it is possible to
construct a universal predictor which is optimal for all infinite sequences.
This predictor assigns nonvanishing limit probabilities precisely to the
recursive sequences. Under the stronger criteria of effectiveness it is
possible to establish a law of large numbers for sequences random relative to a
computable distribution, which may be useful as a criterion of "rationality"
for methods of probabilistic prediction. A remarkable feature of effective
predictors is the fact that they are expressible in the special form first
proposed by Solomonoff. In this form sequence prediction reduces to assigning
high probabilities to initial segments with short and/or numerous encodings.
This fact provides the link between theories of randomness and Solomonoff's
theory of prediction.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning identification models have shown promise for identifying gas
plumes in Longwave IR hyperspectral images of urban scenes, particularly when a
large library of gases are being considered. Because many gases have similar
spectral signatures, it is important to properly estimate the signal from a
detected plume. Typically, a scene's global mean spectrum and covariance matrix
are estimated to whiten the plume's signal, which removes the background's
signature from the gas signature. However, urban scenes can have many different
background materials that are spatially and spectrally heterogeneous. This can
lead to poor identification performance when the global background estimate is
not representative of a given local background material. We use image
segmentation, along with an iterative background estimation algorithm, to
create local estimates for the various background materials that reside
underneath a gas plume. Our method outperforms global background estimation on
a set of simulated and real gas plumes. This method shows promise in increasing
deep learning identification confidence, while being simple and easy to tune
when considering diverse plumes.

<p class="mathjax">Current techniques in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
estimate camera displacement by comparing image features of consecutive scenes.
These algorithms depend on scene continuity, hence requires frequent camera
inputs. However, processing images frequently can lead to significant memory
usage and computation overhead. In this study, we introduce SemanticSLAM, an
end-to-end visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes semantic features
extracted from an RGB-D sensor. This approach enables the creation of a
semantic map of the environment and ensures reliable camera localization.
SemanticSLAM is scene-agnostic, which means it doesn't require retraining for
different environments. It operates effectively in indoor settings, even with
infrequent camera input, without prior knowledge. The strength of SemanticSLAM
lies in its ability to gradually refine the semantic map and improve pose
estimation. This is achieved by a convolutional long-short-term-memory
(ConvLSTM) network, trained to correct errors during map construction. Compared
to existing VSLAM algorithms, SemanticSLAM improves pose estimation by 17%. The
resulting semantic map provides interpretable information about the environment
and can be easily applied to various downstream tasks, such as path planning,
obstacle avoidance, and robot navigation. The code will be publicly available
at https://github.com/Leomingyangli/SemanticSLAM

<p class="mathjax">The growing application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of
information retrieval (IR) affects different domains, including cultural
heritage. By facilitating organisation and retrieval of large volumes of
heritage-related content, AI-driven IR systems inform users about a broad range
of historical phenomena, including genocides (e.g. the Holocaust). However, it
is currently unclear to what degree IR systems are capable of dealing with
multiple ethical challenges associated with the curation of genocide-related
information. To address this question, this chapter provides an overview of
ethical challenges associated with the human curation of genocide-related
information using a three-part framework inspired by Belmont criteria (i.e.
curation challenges associated with respect for individuals, beneficence and
justice/fairness). Then, the chapter discusses to what degree the
above-mentioned challenges are applicable to the ways in which AI-driven IR
systems deal with genocide-related information and what can be the potential
ways of bridging AI and memory ethics in this context.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Question Answering (VQA) in the medical domain presents a unique,
interdisciplinary challenge, combining fields such as Computer Vision, Natural
Language Processing, and Knowledge Representation. Despite its importance,
research in medical VQA has been scant, only gaining momentum since 2018.
Addressing this gap, our research delves into the effective representation of
radiology images and the joint learning of multimodal representations,
surpassing existing methods. We innovatively augment the SLAKE dataset,
enabling our model to respond to a more diverse array of questions, not limited
to the immediate content of radiology or pathology images. Our model achieves a
top-1 accuracy of 79.55\% with a less complex architecture, demonstrating
comparable performance to current state-of-the-art models. This research not
only advances medical VQA but also opens avenues for practical applications in
diagnostic settings.

<p class="mathjax">Visual place recognition is a challenging task in the field of computer
vision, and autonomous robotics and vehicles, which aims to identify a location
or a place from visual inputs. Contemporary methods in visual place recognition
employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image
for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and
distracting elements in the image may impact the effectiveness of the place
recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on task-relevant
regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present
PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition.
PlaceFormer employs patch tokens from the transformer to create global image
descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved
images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form
multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it
selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These
selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores
across different patch sizes. Subsequently, spatial scores from each patch size
are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to
re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and
computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory.

deal with the problem of data scarcity. A data augmentation strategy is used to
deal with the problem of data scarcity. Through the years, much work has been
done on data augmentation for the English language. In contrast, very less work
has been done on Indian languages. This is contrary to the fact that data
augmentation is used to deal with data scarcity. In this work, we focus on
implementing techniques like Easy Data Augmentation, Back Translation,
Paraphrasing, Text Generation using LLMs, and Text Expansion using LLMs for
text classification on different languages. We focus on 6 Indian languages
namely: Sindhi, Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, Telugu, and Sanskrit. According to
our knowledge, no such work exists for text augmentation on Indian languages.
We carry out binary as well as multi-class text classification to make our
results more comparable. We get surprising results as basic data augmentation
techniques surpass LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Street View Images (SVI) are a common source of valuable data for
researchers. Researchers have used SVI data for estimating pedestrian volumes,
demographic surveillance, and to better understand built and natural
environments in cityscapes. However, the most common source of publicly
available SVI data is Google Street View. Google Street View images are
collected infrequently, making temporal analysis challenging, especially in low
population density areas. Our main contribution is the development of an
open-source data pipeline for processing 360-degree video recorded from a
car-mounted camera. The video data is used to generate SVIs, which then can be
used as an input for temporal analysis. We demonstrate the use of the pipeline
by collecting a SVI dataset over a 38-month longitudinal survey of Seattle, WA,
USA during the COVID-19 pandemic. The output of our pipeline is validated
through statistical analyses of pedestrian traffic in the images. We confirm
known results in the literature and provide new insights into outdoor
pedestrian traffic patterns. This study demonstrates the feasibility and value
of collecting and using SVI for research purposes beyond what is possible with
currently available SVI data. Limitations and future improvements on the data
pipeline and case study are also discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Demand forecasting is a prominent business use case that allows retailers to
optimize inventory planning, logistics, and core business decisions. One of the
key challenges in demand forecasting is accounting for relationships and
interactions between articles. Most modern forecasting approaches provide
independent article-level predictions that do not consider the impact of
related articles. Recent research has attempted addressing this challenge using
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and showed promising results. This paper builds on
previous research on GNNs and makes two contributions. First, we integrate a
GNN encoder into a state-of-the-art DeepAR model. The combined model produces
probabilistic forecasts, which are crucial for decision-making under
uncertainty. Second, we propose to build graphs using article attribute
similarity, which avoids reliance on a pre-defined graph structure. Experiments
on three real-world datasets show that the proposed approach consistently

<p class="mathjax">Computer-based scene understanding has influenced fields ranging from urban
planning to autonomous vehicle performance, yet little is known about how well
these technologies work across social differences. We investigate the biases of
deep convolutional neural networks (dCNNs) in scene classification, using
nearly one million images from global and US sources, including user-submitted
home photographs and Airbnb listings. We applied statistical models to quantify
the impact of socioeconomic indicators such as family income, Human Development
Index (HDI), and demographic factors from public data sources (CIA and US
Census) on dCNN performance. Our analyses revealed significant socioeconomic
bias, where pretrained dCNNs demonstrated lower classification accuracy, lower
classification confidence, and a higher tendency to assign labels that could be
offensive when applied to homes (e.g., "ruin", "slum"), especially in images
from homes with lower socioeconomic status (SES). This trend is consistent
across two datasets of international images and within the diverse economic and
racial landscapes of the United States. This research contributes to
understanding biases in computer vision, emphasizing the need for more
inclusive and representative training datasets. By mitigating the bias in the
computer vision pipelines, we can ensure fairer and more equitable outcomes for
applied computer vision, including home valuation and smart home security
systems. There is urgency in addressing these biases, which can significantly
impact critical decisions in urban development and resource allocation. Our
findings also motivate the development of AI systems that better understand and
serve diverse communities, moving towards technology that equitably benefits
all sectors of society.

<p class="mathjax">Invasive species in water bodies pose a major threat to the environment and
biodiversity globally. Due to increased transportation and trade, non-native
species have been introduced to new environments, causing damage to ecosystems
and leading to economic losses in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.
Therefore, there is a pressing need for risk assessment and management
techniques to mitigate the impact of these invasions. This study aims to
develop a new physics-inspired model to forecast maritime shipping traffic and
thus inform risk assessment of invasive species spread through global
transportation networks. Inspired by the gravity model for international
trades, our model considers various factors that influence the likelihood and
impact of vessel activities, such as shipping flux density, distance between
ports, trade flow, and centrality measures of transportation hubs.
Additionally, by analyzing the risk network of invasive species, we provide a
comprehensive framework for assessing the invasion threat level given a pair of
origin and destination. Accordingly, this paper introduces transformers to
gravity models to rebuild the short- and long-term dependencies that make the
risk analysis feasible. Thus, we introduce a physics-inspired framework that
achieves an 89% segmentation accuracy for existing and non-existing
trajectories and an 84.8% accuracy for the number of vessels flowing between
key port areas, representing more than 10% improvement over the traditional
deep-gravity model. Along these lines, this research contributes to a better
understanding of invasive species risk assessment. It allows policymakers,
conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize management actions by
identifying high-risk invasion pathways. Besides, our model is versatile and
can include new data sources, making it suitable for assessing species invasion
risks in a changing global landscape.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian sampling is an important task in statistics and machine learning.
Over the past decade, many ensemble-type sampling methods have been proposed.
In contrast to the classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, these new
methods deploy a large number of interactive samples, and the communication
between these samples is crucial in speeding up the convergence. To justify the
validity of these sampling strategies, the concept of interacting particles
naturally calls for the mean-field theory. The theory establishes a
correspondence between particle interactions encoded in a set of coupled
ODEs/SDEs and a PDE that characterizes the evolution of the underlying
distribution. This bridges numerical algorithms with the PDE theory used to
show convergence in time. Many mathematical machineries are developed to
provide the mean-field analysis, and we showcase two such examples: The
coupling method and the compactness argument built upon the martingale
strategy. The former has been deployed to show the convergence of ensemble
Kalman sampler and ensemble Kalman inversion, and the latter will be shown to
be immensely powerful in proving the validity of the Vlasov-Boltzmann
simulator.

<p class="mathjax">The system architecture controlling a group of robots is generally set before
deployment and can be either centralized or decentralized. This dichotomy is
highly constraining, because decentralized systems are typically fully
self-organized and therefore difficult to design analytically, whereas
centralized systems have single points of failure and limited scalability. To
address this dichotomy, we present the Self-organizing Nervous System (SoNS), a
novel robot swarm architecture based on self-organized hierarchy. The SoNS
approach enables robots to autonomously establish, maintain, and reconfigure
dynamic multi-level system architectures. For example, a robot swarm consisting
of $n$ independent robots could transform into a single $n$-robot SoNS and then
into several independent smaller SoNSs, where each SoNS uses a temporary and
dynamic hierarchy. Leveraging the SoNS approach, we show that sensing,
actuation, and decision-making can be coordinated in a locally centralized way,
without sacrificing the benefits of scalability, flexibility, and fault
tolerance, for which swarm robotics is usually studied. In several
proof-of-concept robot missions -- including binary decision-making and
search-and-rescue -- we demonstrate that the capabilities of the SoNS approach
greatly advance the state of the art in swarm robotics. The missions are
conducted with a real heterogeneous aerial-ground robot swarm, using a
custom-developed quadrotor platform. We also demonstrate the scalability of the
SoNS approach in swarms of up to 250 robots in a physics-based simulator, and
demonstrate several types of system fault tolerance in simulation and reality.

<p class="mathjax">Seniors residing in rural areas often encounter limited accessibility to
opportunities, resources, and services. This paper introduces a model proposing
that both aging and rural residency are factors contributing to the restricted
accessibility faced by rural seniors. Leveraging data from the 2017 National
Household Travel Survey, the study examines three hypotheses pertaining to this
causal model. Multiple causal pathways emerge in the data analysis, with
mobility identified as a mediator in one of them. The study further identifies
specific challenges faced by rural seniors, such as the reduced accessibility
in reaching medical services and assisting others. These challenges stem
primarily from aging and geographic obstacles that not only diminish their
willingness to travel but also restrict more in the group from choosing
transportation modes with higher mobility. The insights gained from this study
serve as a foundation for devising effective methods to enhance transportation
accessibility for seniors in rural areas.

XAI more accessible to a wider audience through a custom Large Language Model

generate clear, concise summaries of various XAI methods, tailored for
different audiences, including business professionals and academics. The key
feature of our model is its ability to adapt explanations to match each

Results from our use-case studies show that our model is effective in providing
easy-to-understand, audience-specific explanations, regardless of the XAI
method used. This adaptability improves the accessibility of XAI, bridging the

<p class="mathjax">Counterfactual Explanations (CE) is the de facto method for providing insight
and interpretability in black-box decision-making models by identifying
alternative input instances that lead to different outcomes. This paper extends
the concept of CEs to a distributional context, broadening the scope from
individual data points to entire input and output distributions, named
Distributional Counterfactual Explanation (DCE). In DCE, our focus shifts to
analyzing the distributional properties of the factual and counterfactual,
drawing parallels to the classical approach of assessing individual instances
and their resulting decisions. We leverage Optimal Transport (OT) to frame a
chance-constrained optimization problem, aiming to derive a counterfactual
distribution that closely aligns with its factual counterpart, substantiated by
statistical confidence. Our proposed optimization method, DISCOUNT,
strategically balances this confidence across both input and output
distributions. This algorithm is accompanied by an analysis of its convergence
rate. The efficacy of our proposed method is substantiated through a series of
illustrative case studies, highlighting its potential in providing deep
insights into decision-making models.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have emerged as a promising technology
in generative modeling. The success of DPMs relies on two ingredients: time
reversal of Markov diffusion processes and score matching. Most existing work
implicitly assumes that score matching is close to perfect, while this
assumption is questionable. In view of possibly unguaranteed score matching, we
propose a new criterion -- the contraction of backward sampling in the design
of DPMs. This leads to a novel class of contractive DPMs (CDPMs), including
contractive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and contractive sub-variance
preserving (sub-VP) stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The key insight
is that the contraction in the backward process narrows score matching errors,
as well as discretization error. Thus, the proposed CDPMs are robust to both
sources of error. Our proposal is supported by theoretical results, and is
corroborated by experiments. Notably, contractive sub-VP shows the best
performance among all known SDE-based DPMs on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are enabling
impressive coordination in heterogeneous multi-robot teams. However, existing
approaches often overlook the challenge of generalizing learned policies to
teams of new compositions, sizes, and robots. While such generalization might
not be important in teams of virtual agents that can retrain policies
on-demand, it is pivotal in multi-robot systems that are deployed in the
real-world and must readily adapt to inevitable changes. As such, multi-robot
policies must remain robust to team changes -- an ability we call adaptive
teaming. In this work, we investigate if awareness and communication of robot
capabilities can provide such generalization by conducting detailed experiments
involving an established multi-robot test bed. We demonstrate that shared
decentralized policies, that enable robots to be both aware of and communicate
their capabilities, can achieve adaptive teaming by implicitly capturing the
fundamental relationship between collective capabilities and effective
coordination. Videos of trained policies can be viewed at:

functions for the original system, i.e the first system in the hierarchy. These
non-homogeneous polynomials are used to obtain accurate outer approximation for
the reachable set given the initial condition and less conservative bounds for
the impulse response peak of linear, possibly time-varying systems. In
addition, we pose an extension to the presented approach to construct invariant
sets that are not necessarily Lyapunov functions. The introduced methods are
based on elementary linear systems theory and offer very much flexibility in
defining arbitrary polynomial Lyapunov functions and invariant sets for LTV
systems.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately typing entity mentions from text segments is a fundamental task
for various natural language processing applications. Many previous approaches
rely on massive human-annotated data to perform entity typing. Nevertheless,
collecting such data in highly specialized science and engineering domains
(e.g., software engineering and security) can be time-consuming and costly,
without mentioning the domain gaps between training and inference data if the
model needs to be applied to confidential datasets. In this paper, we study the
task of seed-guided fine-grained entity typing in science and engineering
domains, which takes the name and a few seed entities for each entity type as
the only supervision and aims to classify new entity mentions into both seen
and unseen types (i.e., those without seed entities). To solve this problem, we
propose SEType which first enriches the weak supervision by finding more
entities for each seen type from an unlabeled corpus using the contextualized
representations of pre-trained language models. It then matches the enriched
entities to unlabeled text to get pseudo-labeled samples and trains a textual
entailment model that can make inferences for both seen and unseen types.
Extensive experiments on two datasets covering four domains demonstrate the
effectiveness of SEType in comparison with various baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Numerous successes have been achieved in combating the COVID-19 pandemic,
initially using various precautionary measures like lockdowns, social
distancing, and the use of face masks. More recently, various vaccinations have
been developed to aid in the prevention or reduction of the severity of the
COVID-19 infection. Despite the effectiveness of the precautionary measures and
the vaccines, there are several controversies that are massively shared on
social media platforms like Twitter. In this paper, we explore the use of
state-of-the-art transformer-based language models to study people's acceptance
of vaccines in Nigeria. We developed a novel dataset by crawling multi-lingual
tweets using relevant hashtags and keywords. Our analysis and visualizations
revealed that most tweets expressed neutral sentiments about COVID-19 vaccines,
with some individuals expressing positive views, and there was no strong
preference for specific vaccine types, although Moderna received slightly more
positive sentiment. We also found out that fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM with
an appropriate dataset can yield competitive results, even if the LLM was not
initially pre-trained on the specific language of that dataset.

<p class="mathjax">As the influence of large language models (LLMs) spans across global
communities, their safety challenges in multilingual settings become paramount
for alignment research. This paper examines the variations in safety challenges
faced by LLMs across different languages and discusses approaches to
alleviating such concerns. By comparing how state-of-the-art LLMs respond to
the same set of malicious prompts written in higher- vs. lower-resource
languages, we observe that (1) LLMs tend to generate unsafe responses much more
often when a malicious prompt is written in a lower-resource language, and (2)
LLMs tend to generate more irrelevant responses to malicious prompts in
lower-resource languages. To understand where the discrepancy can be
attributed, we study the effect of instruction tuning with reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) or supervised finetuning (SFT) on the
HH-RLHF dataset. Surprisingly, while training with high-resource languages
improves model alignment, training in lower-resource languages yields minimal
improvement. This suggests that the bottleneck of cross-lingual alignment is
rooted in the pretraining stage. Our findings highlight the challenges in
cross-lingual LLM safety, and we hope they inform future research in this
direction.

<p class="mathjax">Increased delegation of commercial, scientific, governmental, and personal
activities to AI agents -- systems capable of pursuing complex goals with
limited supervision -- may exacerbate existing societal risks and introduce new
risks. Understanding and mitigating these risks involves critically evaluating
existing governance structures, revising and adapting these structures where
needed, and ensuring accountability of key stakeholders. Information about
where, why, how, and by whom certain AI agents are used, which we refer to as
\textbf{visibility}, is critical to these objectives. In this paper, we assess
three categories of measures to increase visibility into AI agents:
\textbf{agent identifiers}, \textbf{real-time monitoring}, and \textbf{activity
logging}. For each, we outline potential implementations that vary in
intrusiveness and informativeness. We analyze how the measures apply across a
spectrum of centralized through decentralized deployment contexts, accounting
for various actors in the supply chain including hardware and software service
providers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our measures for privacy and
concentration of power. Further work into understanding the measures and
mitigating their negative impacts can help to build a foundation for the
governance of AI agents.

human-level AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI) means. We investigate
key social, political, and ethical assumptions made by influential conceptions

scholarship on the political and social character of intelligence in both
humans and machines to defend a pluralistic, democratic, and participatory
conception of the topic. We argue that framing AGI or human-level AI as a
technical or value-neutral topic leads to political, ethical, and epistemic

encode, the people they include or exclude, and a view toward epistemic
justice.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in applications such as video games and
robotics, but ensuring safety and stability remains challenging when using RL
to control real-world systems where using model-free algorithms suffering from
low sample efficiency might be prohibitive. This paper first provides safety
and stability definitions for the RL system, and then introduces a Neural
ordinary differential equations-based Lyapunov-Barrier Actor-Critic (NLBAC)
framework that leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to
approximate system dynamics and integrates the Control Barrier Function (CBF)
and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) frameworks with the actor-critic method to
assist in maintaining the safety and stability for the system. Within this
framework, we employ the augmented Lagrangian method to update the RL-based
controller parameters. Additionally, we introduce an extra backup controller in
situations where CBF constraints for safety and the CLF constraint for
stability cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate
that the framework leads the system to approach the desired state and allows
fewer violations of safety constraints with better sample efficiency compared
to other methods.

scientific development but requires significant performance analysis and
optimization. Performance analysis tools help developers manage the increasing
complexity and scale of performance data, but often rely on the user to
manually explore low-level data and are rigid in how the data can be
manipulated. We propose a Python-based API, Chopper, which provides high-level
and flexible performance analysis for both single and multiple executions of
parallel applications. Chopper facilitates performance analysis and reduces
developer effort by providing configurable high-level methods for common
performance analysis tasks such as calculating load imbalance, hot paths,
scalability bottlenecks, correlation between metrics and CCT nodes, and causes
of performance variability within a robust and mature Python environment that
provides fluid access to lower-level data manipulations. We demonstrate how
Chopper allows developers to quickly and succinctly explore performance and
identify issues across applications such as AMG, Laghos, LULESH, Quicksilver
and Tortuga.

<p class="mathjax">With the advent of byte-addressable memory devices, such as CXL memory,
persistent memory, and storage-class memory, tiered memory systems have become
a reality. Page migration is the de facto method within operating systems for
managing tiered memory. It aims to bring hot data whenever possible into fast
memory to optimize the performance of data accesses while using slow memory to
accommodate data spilled from fast memory. While the existing research has
demonstrated the effectiveness of various optimizations on page migration, it
falls short of addressing a fundamental question: Is exclusive memory tiering,
in which a page is either present in fast memory or slow memory, but not both
simultaneously, the optimal strategy for tiered memory management?
<br />We demonstrate that page migration-based exclusive memory tiering suffers
significant performance degradation when fast memory is under pressure. In this
paper, we propose non-exclusive memory tiering, a page management strategy that
retains a copy of pages recently promoted from slow memory to fast memory to
mitigate memory thrashing. To enable non-exclusive memory tiering, we develop
MATRYOSHKA, a new mechanism that features transactional page migration and page
shadowing. MATRYOSHKA removes page migration off the program's critical path
and makes migration asynchronous. Evaluations with microbenchmarks and
realworld applications show that MATRYOSHKA achieves 6x performance improvement
over the state-of-the-art transparent page placement (TPP) approach under
memory pressure. We also compare MATRYOSHKA with a recently proposed
sampling-based migration approach and demonstrate MATRYOSHKA's strengths and
potential weaknesses in various scenarios. Through the evaluations, we discover
a serious issue facing all tested approaches, unfortunately including
MATRYOSHKA, and call for further research on tiered memory-aware memory
allocation.

<p class="mathjax">Learning time-evolving objects such as multivariate time series and dynamic
networks requires the development of novel knowledge representation mechanisms
and neural network architectures, which allow for capturing implicit
time-dependent information contained in the data. Such information is typically
not directly observed but plays a key role in the learning task performance. In
turn, lack of time dimension in knowledge encoding mechanisms for
time-dependent data leads to frequent model updates, poor learning performance,
and, as a result, subpar decision-making. Here we propose a new approach to a
time-aware knowledge representation mechanism that notably focuses on implicit
time-dependent topological information along multiple geometric dimensions. In
particular, we propose a new approach, named \textit{Temporal MultiPersistence}
(TMP), which produces multidimensional topological fingerprints of the data by
using the existing single parameter topological summaries. The main idea behind
TMP is to merge the two newest directions in topological representation
learning, that is, multi-persistence which simultaneously describes data shape
evolution along multiple key parameters, and zigzag persistence to enable us to
extract the most salient data shape information over time. We derive
theoretical guarantees of TMP vectorizations and show its utility, in
application to forecasting on benchmark traffic flow, Ethereum blockchain, and
electrocardiogram datasets, demonstrating the competitive performance,
especially, in scenarios of limited data records. In addition, our TMP method
improves the computational efficiency of the state-of-the-art multipersistence
summaries up to 59.5 times.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-training large language models is known to be extremely resource
intensive and often times inefficient, under-utilizing the information
encapsulated in the training text sequences. In this paper, we present SpacTor,
a new training procedure consisting of (1) a hybrid objective combining span
corruption (SC) and token replacement detection (RTD), and (2) a two-stage
curriculum that optimizes the hybrid objective over the initial $\tau$
iterations, then transitions to standard SC loss. We show empirically that the
effectiveness of the hybrid objective is tied to the two-stage pre-training
schedule, and provide extensive analysis on why this is the case. In our
experiments with encoder-decoder architectures (T5) on a variety of NLP tasks,
SpacTor-T5 yields the same downstream performance as standard SC pre-training,
while enabling a 50% reduction in pre-training iterations and 40% reduction in
total FLOPs. Alternatively, given the same amount of computing budget, we find
that SpacTor results in significantly improved downstream benchmark
performance.

<p class="mathjax">In hyperspectral sparse unmixing, a successful approach employs spectral
bundles to address the variability of the endmembers in the spatial domain.
However, the regularization penalties usually employed aggregate substantial
computational complexity, and the solutions are very noise-sensitive. We
generalize a multiscale spatial regularization approach to solve the unmixing
problem by incorporating group sparsity-inducing mixed norms. Then, we propose
a noise-robust method that can take advantage of the bundle structure to deal
with endmember variability while ensuring inter- and intra-class sparsity in
abundance estimation with reasonable computational cost. We also present a
general heuristic to select the \emph{most representative} abundance estimation
over multiple runs of the unmixing process, yielding a solution that is robust
and highly reproducible. Experiments illustrate the robustness and consistency
of the results when compared to related methods.

<p class="mathjax">This chapter focuses on gender-related errors in machine translation (MT) in
the context of low-resource languages. We begin by explaining what low-resource
languages are, examining the inseparable social and computational factors that
create such linguistic hierarchies. We demonstrate through a case study of our
mother tongue Bengali, a global language spoken by almost 300 million people
but still classified as low-resource, how gender is assumed and inferred in
translations to and from the high(est)-resource English when no such
information is provided in source texts. We discuss the postcolonial and
societal impacts of such errors leading to linguistic erasure and
representational harms, and conclude by discussing potential solutions towards
uplifting languages by providing them more agency in MT conversations.

<p class="mathjax">Open-Source Software (OSS) vulnerabilities bring great challenges to the
software security and pose potential risks to our society. Enormous efforts
have been devoted into automated vulnerability detection, among which deep
learning (DL)-based approaches have proven to be the most effective. However,
the current labeled data present the following limitations: (1) \textbf{Tangled
Patches}: Developers may submit code changes unrelated to vulnerability fixes
within patches, leading to tangled patches. (2) \textbf{Lacking
Inter-procedural Vulnerabilities}: The existing vulnerability datasets
typically contain function-level and file-level vulnerabilities, ignoring the
relations between functions, thus rendering the approaches unable to detect the
inter-procedural vulnerabilities. (3) \textbf{Outdated Patches}: The existing
datasets usually contain outdated patches, which may bias the model during
training.
<br />To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose an automated data
collection framework and construct the first repository-level high-quality
vulnerability dataset named \textbf{ReposVul}. The proposed framework mainly
contains three modules: (1) A vulnerability untangling module, aiming at
distinguishing vulnerability-fixing related code changes from tangled patches,
in which the Large Language Models (LLMs) and static analysis tools are jointly
employed. (2) A multi-granularity dependency extraction module, aiming at
capturing the inter-procedural call relationships of vulnerabilities, in which
we construct multiple-granularity information for each vulnerability patch,
including repository-level, file-level, function-level, and line-level. (3) A
trace-based filtering module, aiming at filtering the outdated patches, which
leverages the file path trace-based filter and commit time trace-based filter
to construct an up-to-date dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Question answering (QA) can only make progress if we know if an answer is
correct, but for many of the most challenging and interesting QA examples,
current evaluation metrics to determine answer equivalence (AE) often do not
align with human judgments, particularly more verbose, free-form answers from
large language models (LLM). There are two challenges: a lack of data and that
models are too big: LLM-based scorers can correlate better with human judges,
but this task has only been tested on limited QA datasets, and even when
available, update of the model is limited because LLMs are large and often
expensive. We rectify both of these issues by providing clear and consistent
guidelines for evaluating AE in machine QA adopted from professional human QA
contests. We also introduce a combination of standard evaluation and a more
efficient, robust, and lightweight discriminate AE classifier-based matching
method (CFMatch, smaller than 1 MB), trained and validated to more accurately
evaluate answer correctness in accordance with adopted expert AE rules that are
more aligned with human judgments.

<p class="mathjax">Inverse design, where we seek to design input variables in order to optimize
an underlying objective function, is an important problem that arises across
fields such as mechanical engineering to aerospace engineering. Inverse design
is typically formulated as an optimization problem, with recent works
leveraging optimization across learned dynamics models. However, as models are
optimized they tend to fall into adversarial modes, preventing effective
sampling. We illustrate that by instead optimizing over the learned energy
function captured by the diffusion model, we can avoid such adversarial
examples and significantly improve design performance. We further illustrate
how such a design system is compositional, enabling us to combine multiple
different diffusion models representing subcomponents of our desired system to
design systems with every specified component. In an N-body interaction task
and a challenging 2D multi-airfoil design task, we demonstrate that by
composing the learned diffusion model at test time, our method allows us to
design initial states and boundary shapes that are more complex than those in
the training data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural inverse
design method by an average of 41.5% in prediction MAE and 14.3% in design
objective for the N-body dataset and discovers formation flying to minimize
drag in the multi-airfoil design task. Project website and code can be found at

<p class="mathjax">In the field of autonomous driving, online high-definition (HD) map
reconstruction is crucial for planning tasks. Recent research has developed
several high-performance HD map reconstruction models to meet this necessity.
However, the point sequences within the instance vectors may be jittery or
jagged due to prediction bias, which can impact subsequent tasks. Therefore,
this paper proposes the Anti-disturbance Map reconstruction framework (ADMap).
To mitigate point-order jitter, the framework consists of three modules:
Multi-Scale Perception Neck, Instance Interactive Attention (IIA), and Vector
Direction Difference Loss (VDDL). By exploring the point-order relationships
between and within instances in a cascading manner, the model can monitor the
point-order prediction process more effectively. ADMap achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Extensive
results demonstrate its ability to produce stable and reliable map elements in
complex and changing driving scenarios. Code and more demos are available at
https://github.com/hht1996ok/ADMap.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, it has been revealed that small semantic segmentation (SS) models
exhibit a tendency to make errors in maintaining boundary region completeness
and preserving target region connectivity, despite their effective segmentation
of the main object regions. To address these errors, we propose a targeted
boundary and relation distillation (BRD) strategy using knowledge distillation
from large teacher models to small student models. Specifically, the boundary
distillation extracts explicit object boundaries from the hierarchical feature
maps of the backbone network, subsequently enhancing the student model's mask
quality in boundary regions. Concurrently, the relation distillation transfers
implicit relations from the teacher model to the student model using
pixel-level self-relation as a bridge, ensuring that the student's mask has
strong target region connectivity. The proposed BRD is designed concretely for
SS and is characterized by simplicity and efficiency. Through experimental
evaluations on multiple SS datasets, including Pascal VOC 2012, Cityscapes,
ADE20K, and COCO-Stuff 10K, we demonstrated that BRD significantly surpasses
the current methods without increasing the inference costs, generating crisp
region boundaries and smooth connecting regions that are challenging for small
models.

<p class="mathjax">The ubiquity of large-scale Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) is on the rise,
sparking interest in model hubs, and dedicated platforms for hosting PTMs.
Despite this trend, a comprehensive exploration of the challenges that users
encounter and how the community leverages PTMs remains lacking. To address this
gap, we conducted an extensive mixed-methods empirical study by focusing on
discussion forums and the model hub of HuggingFace, the largest public model
hub. Based on our qualitative analysis, we present a taxonomy of the challenges
and benefits associated with PTM reuse within this community. We then conduct a
quantitative study to track model-type trends and model documentation evolution
over time. Our findings highlight prevalent challenges such as limited guidance
for beginner users, struggles with model output comprehensibility in training
or inference, and a lack of model understanding. We also identified interesting
trends among models where some models maintain high upload rates despite a
decline in topics related to them. Additionally, we found that despite the
introduction of model documentation tools, its quantity has not increased over
time, leading to difficulties in model comprehension and selection among users.
Our study sheds light on new challenges in reusing PTMs that were not reported
before and we provide recommendations for various stakeholders involved in PTM
reuse.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose agents is
essential for understanding their capabilities and facilitating their
integration into practical applications. However, the evaluation process
presents substantial challenges. A primary obstacle is the benchmarking of
agent performance across diverse scenarios within a unified framework,
especially in maintaining partially-observable environments and ensuring
multi-round interactions. Moreover, current evaluation frameworks mostly focus
on the final success rate, revealing few insights during the process and
failing to provide a deep understanding of the model abilities. To address
these challenges, we introduce AgentBoard, a pioneering comprehensive benchmark
and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored to analytical
evaluation of LLM agents. AgentBoard offers a fine-grained progress rate metric
that captures incremental advancements as well as a comprehensive evaluation
toolkit that features easy assessment of agents for multi-faceted analysis
through interactive visualization. This not only sheds light on the
capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also propels the
interpretability of their performance to the forefront. Ultimately, AgentBoard
serves as a significant step towards demystifying agent behaviors and
accelerating the development of stronger LLM agents.

<p class="mathjax">This letter proposes a market-clearing-based locational marginal carbon
emission (LMCE) metric to assess the marginal carbon emission effect of nodal
load demand. Unlike the prevalent carbon emission flow (CEF) method that relies
on a hypothetical power-flow tracking process, the proposed LMCE metric depends
on a novel sensitivity analysis of market-clearing results, capable of
revealing both energy-dependent and network-dependent impacts on emissions.
Additionally, we introduce a locational average carbon emission (LACE) metric,
derived from LMCE, to effectively measure the general emission effect. It
offers insights into demand-side carbon emission effects, such as a negative
LMCE and LACE indicating emission reduction even as load increases. It can also
prevent excessive demand-side emission allocations. Overall, the proposed
method provides a clear perspective for the ongoing decarbonization policies.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-validation is a widely used technique for assessing the performance of
predictive models on unseen data. Many predictive models, such as Kernel-Based
Partial Least-Squares (PLS) models, require the computation of
$\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{Y}$
using only training set samples from the input and output matrices,
$\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$, respectively. In this work, we present three
algorithms that efficiently compute these matrices. The first one allows no
column-wise preprocessing. The second one allows column-wise centering around
the training set means. The third one allows column-wise centering and
column-wise scaling around the training set means and standard deviations.
Demonstrating correctness and superior computational complexity, they offer
significant cross-validation speedup compared with straight-forward
cross-validation and previous work on fast cross-validation - all without data
leakage. Their suitability for parallelization is highlighted with an
open-source Python implementation combining our algorithms with Improved Kernel
PLS.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a comparison analysis between geometric impedance controls
(GICs) derived from two different potential functions on SE(3) for robotic
manipulators is presented. The first potential function is defined on the Lie
group, utilizing the Frobenius norm of the configuration error matrix. The
second potential function is defined utilizing the Lie algebra, i.e., log-map
of the configuration error. Using a differential geometric approach, the
detailed derivation of the distance metric and potential function on SE(3) is
introduced. The GIC laws are respectively derived from the two potential
functions, followed by extensive comparison analyses. In the qualitative
analysis, the properties of the error function and control laws are analyzed,
while the performances of the controllers are quantitatively compared using
numerical simulation.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, deep learning-based facial landmark detection for in-the-wild faces
has achieved significant improvement. However, there are still challenges in
face landmark detection in other domains (e.g. cartoon, caricature, etc). This
is due to the scarcity of extensively annotated training data. To tackle this
concern, we design a two-stage training approach that effectively leverages
limited datasets and the pre-trained diffusion model to obtain aligned pairs of
landmarks and face in multiple domains. In the first stage, we train a
landmark-conditioned face generation model on a large dataset of real faces. In
the second stage, we fine-tune the above model on a small dataset of
image-landmark pairs with text prompts for controlling the domain. Our new
designs enable our method to generate high-quality synthetic paired datasets
from multiple domains while preserving the alignment between landmarks and
facial features. Finally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained face landmark detection
model on the synthetic dataset to achieve multi-domain face landmark detection.
Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing methods on multi-domain face landmark detection.

<p class="mathjax">Efficiently generating energetically stable crystal structures has long been
a challenge in material design, primarily due to the immense arrangement of
atoms in a crystal lattice. To facilitate the discovery of stable material, we
present a framework for the generation of synthesizable materials, leveraging a
point cloud representation to encode intricate structural information. At the
heart of this framework lies the introduction of a diffusion model as its
foundational pillar. To gauge the efficacy of our approach, we employ it to
reconstruct input structures from our training datasets, rigorously validating
its high reconstruction performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the profound
potential of Point Cloud-Based Crystal Diffusion (PCCD) by generating entirely
new materials, emphasizing their synthesizability. Our research stands as a
noteworthy contribution to the advancement of materials design and synthesis
through the cutting-edge avenue of generative design instead of the
conventional substitution or experience-based discovery.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has made significant advances in computer vision, particularly
in image classification tasks. Despite their high accuracy on training data,
deep learning models often face challenges related to complexity and
overfitting. One notable concern is that the model often relies heavily on a
limited subset of filters for making predictions. This dependency can result in
compromised generalization and an increased vulnerability to minor variations.
While regularization techniques like weight decay, dropout, and data
augmentation are commonly used to address this issue, they may not directly
tackle the reliance on specific filters. Our observations reveal that the heavy
reliance problem gets severe when slow-learning filters are deprived of
learning opportunities due to fast-learning filters. Drawing inspiration from
image augmentation research that combats over-reliance on specific image
regions by removing and replacing parts of images, our idea is to mitigate the
problem of over-reliance on strong filters by substituting highly activated
features. To this end, we present a novel method called Catch-up Mix, which
provides learning opportunities to a wide range of filters during training,
focusing on filters that may lag behind. By mixing activation maps with
relatively lower norms, Catch-up Mix promotes the development of more diverse
representations and reduces reliance on a small subset of filters. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our method in various vision
classification datasets, providing enhanced robustness.

<p class="mathjax">A backward stable numerical calculation of a function with condition number
$\kappa$ will have a relative accuracy of $\kappa\epsilon_{\text{machine}}$.
Standard formulations and software implementations of finite-strain elastic
materials models make use of the deformation gradient $\boldsymbol F = I +
\partial \boldsymbol u/\partial \boldsymbol X$ and Cauchy-Green tensors. These
formulations are not numerically stable, leading to loss of several digits of
accuracy when used in the small strain regime, and often precluding the use of
single precision floating point arithmetic. We trace the source of this
instability to specific points of numerical cancellation, interpretable as
ill-conditioned steps. We show how to compute various strain measures in a
stable way and how to transform common constitutive models to their stable
representations, formulated in either initial or current configuration. The
stable formulations all provide accuracy of order $\epsilon_{\text{machine}}$.
In many cases, the stable formulations have elegant representations in terms of
appropriate strain measures and offer geometric intuition that is lacking in
their standard representation. We show that algorithmic differentiation can
stably compute stresses so long as the strain energy is expressed stably, and
give principles for stable computation that can be applied to inelastic
materials.

tricked by phishing emails. How users make email response decisions is a
missing piece in the puzzle to identifying why people still fall for phishing
emails. We conducted an empirical study using a think-aloud method to
investigate how people make 'response decisions' while reading emails. The
grounded theory analysis of the in-depth qualitative data has enabled us to
identify different elements of email users' decision-making that influence
their email response decisions. Furthermore, we developed a theoretical model
that explains how people could be driven to respond to emails based on the
identified elements of users' email decision-making processes and the
relationships uncovered from the data. The findings provide deeper insights
into phishing email susceptibility due to people's email response
decision-making behavior. We also discuss the implications of our findings for
designers and researchers working in anti-phishing training, education, and

<p class="mathjax">Memory replay based techniques have shown great success for continual
learning with incrementally accumulated Euclidean data. Directly applying them
to continually expanding graphs, however, leads to the potential memory
explosion problem due to the need to buffer representative nodes and their
associated topological neighborhood structures. To this end, we systematically
analyze the key challenges in the memory explosion problem, and present a
general framework, i.e., Parameter Decoupled Graph Neural Networks (PDGNNs)
with Topology-aware Embedding Memory (TEM), to tackle this issue. The proposed
framework not only reduces the memory space complexity from $\mathcal{O}(nd^L)$
to $\mathcal{O}(n)$~\footnote{$n$: memory budget, $d$: average node degree,
$L$: the radius of the GNN receptive field}, but also fully utilizes the
topological information for memory replay. Specifically, PDGNNs decouple
trainable parameters from the computation ego-subgraph via
\textit{Topology-aware Embeddings} (TEs), which compress ego-subgraphs into
compact vectors (i.e., TEs) to reduce the memory consumption. Based on this
framework, we discover a unique \textit{pseudo-training effect} in continual
learning on expanding graphs and this effect motivates us to develop a novel
\textit{coverage maximization sampling} strategy that can enhance the
performance with a tight memory budget. Thorough empirical studies demonstrate
that, by tackling the memory explosion problem and incorporating topological
information into memory replay, PDGNNs with TEM significantly outperform
state-of-the-art techniques, especially in the challenging class-incremental
setting.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have achieved satisfactory results in
many tasks. However, their performance in the task of person re-identification
(ReID) has not been explored to date. This paper will investigate how to adapt
them for the task of ReID. An intuitive idea is to fine-tune MLLM with ReID
image-text datasets, and then use their visual encoder as a backbone for ReID.
However, there still exist two apparent issues: (1) Designing instructions for
ReID, MLLMs may overfit specific instructions, and designing a variety of
instructions will lead to higher costs. (2) Latent image feature vectors from
LLMs are not involved in loss computation. Instructional learning, aligning
image-text features, results in indirect optimization and a learning objective
that inadequately utilizes features, limiting effectiveness in person feature
learning. To address these problems, this paper proposes MLLMReID: Multimodal
Large Language Model-based ReID. Firstly, we proposed Common Instruction, a
simple approach that leverages the essence ability of LLMs to continue writing,
avoiding complex and diverse instruction design. Secondly, we proposed
DirectReID, which effectively employs the latent image feature vectors of
images outputted by LLMs in ReID tasks. The experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our method. We will open-source the code on GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">In practical communication systems, knowledge of channel models is often
absent, and consequently, transceivers need be designed based on empirical
data. In this work, we study data-driven approaches to reliably choosing
decoding metrics and code rates that facilitate reliable communication over
unknown discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). Our analysis is inspired by the
PAC learning theory and does not rely on any assumptions on the statistical
characteristics of DMCs. We show that a naive plug-in algorithm for choosing
decoding metrics is likely to fail for finite training sets. We propose an
alternative algorithm called the virtual sample algorithm and establish a
non-asymptotic lower bound on its performance. The virtual sample algorithm is
then used as a building block for constructing a learning algorithm that
chooses a decoding metric and a code rate using which a transmitter and a
receiver can reliably communicate at a rate arbitrarily close to the channel
mutual information. Therefore, we conclude that DMCs are PAC learnable.

<p class="mathjax">Controllable 3D indoor scene synthesis stands at the forefront of
technological progress, offering various applications like gaming, film, and
augmented/virtual reality. The capability to stylize and de-couple objects
within these scenarios is a crucial factor, providing an advanced level of
control throughout the editing process. This control extends not just to
manipulating geometric attributes like translation and scaling but also
includes managing appearances, such as stylization. Current methods for scene
stylization are limited to applying styles to the entire scene, without the
ability to separate and customize individual objects. Addressing the
intricacies of this challenge, we introduce a unique pipeline designed for
synthesis 3D indoor scenes. Our approach involves strategically placing objects
within the scene, utilizing information from professionally designed bounding
boxes. Significantly, our pipeline prioritizes maintaining style consistency
across multiple objects within the scene, ensuring a cohesive and visually
appealing result aligned with the desired aesthetic. The core strength of our
pipeline lies in its ability to generate 3D scenes that are not only visually
impressive but also exhibit features like photorealism, multi-view consistency,
and diversity. These scenes are crafted in response to various natural language
prompts, demonstrating the versatility and adaptability of our model.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial examples are one critical security threat to various visual
applications, where injected human-imperceptible perturbations can confuse the
output.Generating transferable adversarial examples in the black-box setting is
crucial but challenging in practice. Existing input-diversity-based methods
adopt different image transformations, but may be inefficient due to
insufficient input diversity and an identical perturbation step size. Motivated
by the fact that different image regions have distinctive weights in
classification, this paper proposes a black-box adversarial generative
framework by jointly designing enhanced input diversity and adaptive step
sizes. We design local mixup to randomly mix a group of transformed adversarial
images, strengthening the input diversity. For precise adversarial generation,
we project the perturbation into the $tanh$ space to relax the boundary
constraint. Moreover, the step sizes of different regions can be dynamically
adjusted by integrating a second-order momentum.Extensive experiments on
ImageNet validate that our framework can achieve superior transferability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

between model-generated solutions and traditional algorithms, guided by a
criterion that assesses the prediction credibility based on quantified
uncertainties. Experimental results validate the framework's efficacy,
demonstrating its superiority over traditional deep learning models, notably in
scenarios underrepresented in the training dataset. This work marks a
pioneering endeavor in harnessing self-improving deep learning for interference
management, through the lens of uncertainty quantification.

<p class="mathjax">In high-order and high-dimensional finite elements, ill-conditioned nodal
distributions are often computationally cost-prohibitive. As a result, uniform
distributions quickly fall apart. For tensor-product like elements,
Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto (GLL) nodal distributions are often used as a
substitute. Besides these, other efficient nodal distributions are difficult to
create due to a desired symmetry within elements and conformity with
neighboring elements. In this paper, we provide a general framework to
construct symmetric, well-conditioned, cross-element compatible nodal
distributions which can be used for high-order and high-dimensional finite
elements. Starting from the inherent symmetries in any potential element, the
framework is used to build up nodal groups in a structured and efficient manner
utilizing the natural coordinates of each element, while ensuring nodes stay
within the elements. By constructing constrained symmetry groups, the vertices,
edges, and faces, of all elements are required to conform to their respective
lower-dimensional distributions. Optimizing over these groups yields the
desired optimized nodal distributions. We demonstrate the strength of this
framework by creating and comparing optimized nodal distributions with GLL
distributions (in elements such as the line, quadrilateral, and hexahedron),
and its robustness by generating optimized nodal distributions for otherwise
difficult elements (such as the triangle, tetrahedron, and triangular prism).

<p class="mathjax">In the web era, graph machine learning has been widely used on ubiquitous
graph-structured data. As a pivotal component for bolstering web security and
enhancing the robustness of graph-based applications, the significance of graph
anomaly detection is continually increasing. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have demonstrated efficacy in supervised and semi-supervised graph anomaly
detection, their performance is contingent upon the availability of sufficient
ground truth labels. The labor-intensive nature of identifying anomalies from
complex graph structures poses a significant challenge in real-world
applications. Despite that, the indirect supervision signals from other tasks
(e.g., node classification) are relatively abundant. In this paper, we propose
a novel MultItask acTIve Graph Anomaly deTEction framework, namely MITIGATE.
Firstly, by coupling node classification tasks, MITIGATE obtains the capability
to detect out-of-distribution nodes without known anomalies. Secondly, MITIGATE
quantifies the informativeness of nodes by the confidence difference across
tasks, allowing samples with conflicting predictions to provide informative yet
not excessively challenging information for subsequent training. Finally, to
enhance the likelihood of selecting representative nodes that are distant from
known patterns, MITIGATE adopts a masked aggregation mechanism for distance
measurement, considering both inherent features of nodes and current labeled
status. Empirical studies on four datasets demonstrate that MITIGATE
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection.

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes a simple yet effective technique for refining a
pretrained classifier network. The proposed AdCorDA method is based on
modification of the training set and making use of the duality between network
weights and layer inputs. We call this input space training. The method
consists of two stages - adversarial correction followed by domain adaptation.
Adversarial correction uses adversarial attacks to correct incorrect
training-set classifications. The incorrectly classified samples of the
training set are removed and replaced with the adversarially corrected samples
to form a new training set, and then, in the second stage, domain adaptation is
performed back to the original training set. Extensive experimental validations
show significant accuracy boosts of over 5% on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The
technique can be straightforwardly applied to refinement of weight-quantized
neural networks, where experiments show substantial enhancement in performance
over the baseline. The adversarial correction technique also results in
enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning model bias can arise from dataset composition: sensitive
features correlated to the learning target disturb the model decision rule and
lead to performance differences along the features. Existing de-biasing work
captures prominent and delicate image features which are traceable in model
latent space, like colors of digits or background of animals. However, using
the latent space is not sufficient to understand all dataset feature
correlations. In this work, we propose a framework to extract feature clusters
in a dataset based on image descriptions, allowing us to capture both subtle
and coarse features of the images. The feature co-occurrence pattern is
formulated and correlation is measured, utilizing a human-in-the-loop for
examination. The analyzed features and correlations are human-interpretable, so
we name the method Common-Sense Bias Discovery (CSBD). Having exposed sensitive
correlations in a dataset, we demonstrate that downstream model bias can be
mitigated by adjusting image sampling weights, without requiring a sensitive
group label supervision. Experiments show that our method discovers novel
biases on multiple classification tasks for two benchmark image datasets, and
the intervention outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised bias mitigation
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, methods based on deep learning have been successfully applied to
ship detection for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Despite the
development of numerous ship detection methodologies, detecting small and
coastal ships remains a significant challenge due to the limited features and
clutter in coastal environments. For that, a novel adaptive multi-hierarchical
attention module (AMAM) is proposed to learn multi-scale features and
adaptively aggregate salient features from various feature layers, even in
complex environments. Specifically, we first fuse information from adjacent
feature layers to enhance the detection of smaller targets, thereby achieving
multi-scale feature enhancement. Then, to filter out the adverse effects of
complex backgrounds, we dissect the previously fused multi-level features on
the channel, individually excavate the salient regions, and adaptively
amalgamate features originating from different channels. Thirdly, we present a
novel adaptive multi-hierarchical attention network (AMANet) by embedding the
AMAM between the backbone network and the feature pyramid network (FPN).
Besides, the AMAM can be readily inserted between different frameworks to
improve object detection. Lastly, extensive experiments on two large-scale SAR
ship detection datasets demonstrate that our AMANet method is superior to
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm that scales
on-device learning collaboratively, has emerged as a promising approach for
decentralized AI applications. Local optimization methods such as Federated
Averaging (FedAvg) are the most prominent methods for FL applications. Despite
their simplicity and popularity, the theoretical understanding of local
optimization methods is far from clear. This dissertation aims to advance the
theoretical foundation of local methods in the following three directions.
<br />First, we establish sharp bounds for FedAvg, the most popular algorithm in
Federated Learning. We demonstrate how FedAvg may suffer from a notion we call
iterate bias, and how an additional third-order smoothness assumption may
mitigate this effect and lead to better convergence rates. We explain this
phenomenon from a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) perspective.
<br />Second, we propose Federated Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedAc),
the first principled acceleration of FedAvg, which provably improves the
convergence rate and communication efficiency. Our technique uses on a
potential-based perturbed iterate analysis, a novel stability analysis of
generalized accelerated SGD, and a strategic tradeoff between acceleration and
stability.
<br />Third, we study the Federated Composite Optimization problem, which extends
the classic smooth setting by incorporating a shared non-smooth regularizer. We
show that direct extensions of FedAvg may suffer from the "curse of primal
averaging," resulting in slow convergence. As a solution, we propose a new
primal-dual algorithm, Federated Dual Averaging, which overcomes the curse of
primal averaging by employing a novel inter-client dual averaging procedure.

<p class="mathjax">Structural extraction of events within discourse is critical since it avails
a deeper understanding of communication patterns and behavior trends. Event
argument extraction (EAE), at the core of event-centric understanding, is the
task of identifying role-specific text spans (i.e., arguments) for a given
event. Document-level EAE (DocEAE) focuses on arguments that are scattered
across an entire document. In this work, we explore the capabilities of open
source Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., Flan-UL2, for the DocEAE task. To
this end, we propose ULTRA, a hierarchical framework that extracts event
arguments more cost-effectively -- the method needs as few as 50 annotations
and doesn't require hitting costly API endpoints. Further, it alleviates the
positional bias issue intrinsic to LLMs. ULTRA first sequentially reads text
chunks of a document to generate a candidate argument set, upon which ULTRA
learns to drop non-pertinent candidates through self-refinement. We further
introduce LEAFER to address the challenge LLMs face in locating the exact
boundary of an argument span. ULTRA outperforms strong baselines, which include
strong supervised models and ChatGPT, by 9.8% when evaluated by the exact match
(EM) metric.

<p class="mathjax">In contrast to traditional image restoration methods, all-in-one image
restoration techniques are gaining increased attention for their ability to
restore images affected by diverse and unknown corruption types and levels.
However, contemporary all-in-one image restoration methods omit task-wise
difficulties and employ the same networks to reconstruct images afflicted by
diverse degradations. This practice leads to an underestimation of the task
correlations and suboptimal allocation of computational resources. To elucidate
task-wise complexities, we introduce a novel concept positing that intricate
image degradation can be represented in terms of elementary degradation.
Building upon this foundation, we propose an innovative approach, termed the
Unified-Width Adaptive Dynamic Network (U-WADN), consisting of two pivotal
components: a Width Adaptive Backbone (WAB) and a Width Selector (WS). The WAB
incorporates several nested sub-networks with varying widths, which facilitates
the selection of the most apt computations tailored to each task, thereby
striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency during
runtime. For different inputs, the WS automatically selects the most
appropriate sub-network width, taking into account both task-specific and
sample-specific complexities. Extensive experiments across a variety of image
restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed U-WADN achieves better
performance while simultaneously reducing up to 32.3\% of FLOPs and providing
approximately 15.7\% real-time acceleration. The code has been made available
at \url{https://github.com/xuyimin0926/U-WADN}.

<p class="mathjax">The web serves as a global repository of knowledge, used by billions of
people to search for information. Ensuring that users receive the most relevant
and up-to-date information, especially in the presence of multiple versions of
web content from different time points remains a critical challenge for
information retrieval. This challenge has recently been compounded by the
increased use of question answering tools trained on Wikipedia or web content
and powered by large language models (LLMs) \citep{chatgpt} which have been
found to make up information (or hallucinate), and in addition have been shown
to struggle with the temporal dimensions of information. Even Retriever
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) which incorporate a document database to
reduce LLM hallucination are unable to handle temporal queries correctly. This
leads to instances where RALMs respond to queries such as "Who won the
Wimbledon Championship?", by retrieving document passages related to Wimbledon
but without the ability to differentiate between them based on how recent they
are.
<br />In this paper, we propose and evaluate, TempRALM, a temporally-aware
Retriever Augmented Language Model (RALM) with few-shot learning extensions,
which takes into account both semantically and temporally relevant documents
relative to a given query, rather than relying on semantic similarity alone. We
show that our approach results in up to 74\% improvement in performance over
the baseline RALM model, without requiring model pre-training, recalculating or
replacing the RALM document index, or adding other computationally intensive

textual data that are very common content on the Web (e.g. SEC filings), where
discrete reasoning capabilities are often required. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning
capabilities. We then consider harnessing the amazing power of LLMs to solve
our task. We abstract a Step-wise Pipeline for tabular and textual QA, which
consists of three key steps, including Extractor, Reasoner and Executor, and
initially design an instruction to instantiate the pipeline and validate that
GPT-4 outperforms all existing methods. However, utilizing an online LLM like
GPT-4 holds various challenges in terms of cost, latency, and data security
risk, which motivates us to specialize smaller LLMs in this task. We develop a
TAT-LLM language model by fine-tuning LLaMA 2 with the training data generated
automatically from existing expert-annotated datasets following the Step-wise
Pipeline. The experimental results have verified that our TAT-LLM model can
outperform all baseline models, including the previous best fine-tuned models

<p class="mathjax">A major challenge in Natural Language Processing is obtaining annotated data
for supervised learning. An option is the use of crowdsourcing platforms for
data annotation. However, crowdsourcing introduces issues related to the
annotator's experience, consistency, and biases. An alternative is to use
zero-shot methods, which in turn have limitations compared to their few-shot or
fully supervised counterparts. Recent advancements driven by large language
models show potential, but struggle to adapt to specialized domains with
severely limited data. The most common approaches therefore involve the human
itself randomly annotating a set of datapoints to build initial datasets. But
randomly sampling data to be annotated is often inefficient as it ignores the
characteristics of the data and the specific needs of the model. The situation
worsens when working with imbalanced datasets, as random sampling tends to
heavily bias towards the majority classes, leading to excessive annotated data.
To address these issues, this paper contributes an automatic and informed data
selection architecture to build a small dataset for few-shot learning. Our
proposal minimizes the quantity and maximizes diversity of data selected for
human annotation, while improving model performance.

<p class="mathjax">Robot co-design, where the morphology of a robot is optimized jointly with a
learned policy to solve a specific task, is an emerging area of research. It
holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel
manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators.
Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step
further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can
change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of
reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL)
problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in
the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum
that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of
the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark
for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to
accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine
algorithm on DittoGym and demonstrate robots that learn to change their
morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL
algorithm. More results are available at https://dittogym.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) has attracted vivid attention as a privacy-preserving
distributed learning framework. In this work, we focus on cross-silo FL, where
clients become the model owners after training and are only concerned about the
model's generalization performance on their local data. Due to the data
heterogeneity issue, asking all the clients to join a single FL training
process may result in model performance degradation. To investigate the
effectiveness of collaboration, we first derive a generalization bound for each
client when collaborating with others or when training independently. We show
that the generalization performance of a client can be improved only by
collaborating with other clients that have more training data and similar data
distribution. Our analysis allows us to formulate a client utility maximization
problem by partitioning clients into multiple collaborating groups. A
hierarchical clustering-based collaborative training (HCCT) scheme is then
proposed, which does not need to fix in advance the number of groups. We
further analyze the convergence of HCCT for general non-convex loss functions
which unveils the effect of data similarity among clients. Extensive
simulations show that HCCT achieves better generalization performance than
baseline schemes, whereas it degenerates to independent training and
conventional FL in specific scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Common crowdsourcing systems average estimates of a latent quantity of
interest provided by many crowdworkers to produce a group estimate. We develop
a new approach -- just-predict-others -- that leverages self-supervised
learning and a novel aggregation scheme. This approach adapts weights assigned
to crowdworkers based on estimates they provided for previous quantities. When
skills vary across crowdworkers or their estimates correlate, the weighted sum
offers a more accurate group estimate than the average. Existing algorithms
such as expectation maximization can, at least in principle, produce similarly
accurate group estimates. However, their computational requirements become
onerous when complex models, such as neural networks, are required to express
relationships among crowdworkers. Just-predict-others accommodates such
complexity as well as many other practical challenges. We analyze the efficacy
of just-predict-others through theoretical and computational studies. Among
other things, we establish asymptotic optimality as the number of engagements
per crowdworker grows.

<p class="mathjax">Unrealizability logic (UL) was proposed by Kim et al. as the first
Hoare-style proof system for proving properties that hold for an infinite set
of programs (defined by a regular tree grammar). The goal of our work is to
automate reasoning and proof generation for UL. A key ingredient in UL is the
notion of nonterminal summaries-inductive facts that characterize recursive
nonterminals in the grammar that defines the set of programs. They are
analogous to procedure summaries in Hoare logic. The goal of automating UL led
us to reformulate the inference rules-in particular, introducing a unified rule
for nonterminal summaries, called the rule of adaptation, which draws
inspiration from how procedure summaries are handled in Hoare logic. In the
same way that verification conditions can be used to synthesize loop invariants
for Hoare logic proofs, our reformulation of UL reduces the problem of
synthesizing a nonterminal summary to a Syntax-Guided Synthesis problem. We
implement Wuldo, the first checker and synthesizer for UL. Wuldo can express
proofs beyond the reach of existing tools, including proofs that establish how
infinitely many programs behave on infinitely many inputs, and in some cases
Wuldo can even synthesize the needed nonterminal summaries.

<p class="mathjax">Information graphics are pivotal in effective information dissemination and
storytelling. However, creating such graphics is extremely challenging for
non-professionals, since the design process requires multifaceted skills and
comprehensive knowledge. Thus, despite the many available authoring tools, a
significant gap remains in enabling non-experts to produce compelling
information graphics seamlessly, especially from scratch. Recent breakthroughs
show that Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when tool-augmented, can
autonomously engage with external tools, making them promising candidates for
enabling innovative graphic design applications. In this work, we propose a
LLM-centric interface with the agent GraphiMind for automatic generation,
recommendation, and composition of information graphics design resources, based
on user intent expressed through natural language. Our GraphiMind integrates a
Textual Conversational Interface, powered by tool-augmented LLM, with a
traditional Graphical Manipulation Interface, streamlining the entire design
process from raw resource curation to composition and refinement. Extensive
evaluations highlight our tool's proficiency in simplifying the design process,
opening avenues for its use by non-professional users. Moreover, we spotlight
the potential of LLMs in reshaping the domain of information graphics design,
offering a blend of automation, versatility, and user-centric interactivity.

<p class="mathjax">Elucidating the reasoning process with structured explanations from question
to answer is fundamentally crucial, as it significantly enhances the
interpretability and trustworthiness of question-answering (QA) systems.
However, structured explanations demand models to perform intricate structured
reasoning, which poses great challenges. Most existing methods focus on
single-step reasoning through supervised learning, ignoring logical
dependencies between steps. Meanwhile, existing reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods overlook the structured relationships, impeding RL's
potential in structured reasoning. In this paper, we propose SEER, a novel
method that maximizes a structure-based return to facilitate structured
reasoning and explanation. Our proposed structure-based return precisely
describes the hierarchical and branching structure inherent in structured
reasoning, effectively capturing the intricate relationships between states. We
also introduce a fine-grained reward function to meticulously delineate diverse
reasoning steps. Extensive experiments show that SEER significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 6.9% over
RL-based methods on EntailmentBank, a 4.4% average improvement on STREET
benchmark, and exhibiting outstanding efficiency and cross-dataset
generalization performance.

<p class="mathjax">Homelessness is a humanitarian challenge affecting an estimated 1.6 billion
people worldwide. In the face of rising homeless populations in developed
nations and a strain on social services, government agencies are increasingly
adopting data-driven models to determine one's risk of experiencing
homelessness and assigning scarce resources to those in need. We conducted a
systematic literature review of 57 papers to understand the evolution of these
decision-making algorithms. We investigated trends in computational methods,
predictor variables, and target outcomes used to develop the models using a
human-centered lens and found that only 9 papers (15.7%) investigated model
fairness and bias. We uncovered tensions between explainability and ecological
validity wherein predictive risk models (53.4%) focused on reductive
explainability while resource allocation models (25.9%) were dependent on
unrealistic assumptions and simulated data that are not useful in practice.
Further, we discuss research challenges and opportunities for developing
human-centered algorithms in this area.

analysis aimed at examining whether public discussions were commensurate with

consensus based on samples of abstracts from preprint servers and compare
against the volume of public discussions on Twitter mentioning these papers. We
find that anti-consensus posts and users, though overall less numerous than
pro-consensus ones, are vastly over-represented on Twitter, thus producing a
false consensus effect. This transpires with favorable papers being
disproportionately amplified, along with an influx of new anti-consensus user

<p class="mathjax">The flexibility and range of motion in human hands play a crucial role in
human interaction with the environment and have been studied across different
fields. Researchers explored various technological solutions for gathering
information from the hands. These solutions include tracking hand motion
through cameras or wearable sensors and using wearable sensors to measure the
position and pressure of contact points. Data gloves can collect both types of
information by utilizing inertial measurement units, flex sensors, magnetic
trackers for motion tracking, and force resistors or touch sensors for contact
measurement. Although there are commercially available data gloves, researchers
often create custom data gloves to achieve the desired flexibility and control
over the hardware. However, the existing literature lacks standardization and
the reuse of previously designed data gloves. As a result, many gloves with
unclear characteristics exist, which makes replication challenging and
negatively impacts the reproducibility of studies. This work proposes a
modular, open hardware and software architecture for creating customized data
gloves based on IMU technology. We also provide an architecture implementation
along with an experimental protocol to evaluate device performance.

cryptosystems through the application of the Yoneda Lemma. It explicitly
illustrates that widely adopted systems, including ElGamal, RSA, Benaloh,
Regev's LWE, and NTRUEncrypt, directly derive from the principles of the Yoneda
Lemma. This synthesis gives rise to a holistic homomorphic encryption framework
named the Yoneda Encryption Scheme. Within this scheme, encryption is
elucidated through the bijective maps of the Yoneda Lemma Isomorphism, and
decryption seamlessly follows from the naturality of these maps. This
unification suggests a conjecture for a unified model theory framework,
providing a basis for reasoning about both homomorphic and fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) schemes. As a practical demonstration, the paper introduces an
FHE scheme capable of processing arbitrary finite sequences of encrypted
multiplications and additions without the need for additional tweaking
techniques, such as squashing or bootstrapping. This not only underscores the
practical implications of the proposed theoretical advancements but also
introduces new possibilities for leveraging model theory and forcing techniques
in cryptography to facilitate the design of FHE schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown exceptional capabilities in many
natual language understanding and generation tasks. However, the
personalization issue still remains a much-coveted property, especially when it
comes to the multiple sources involved in the dialogue system. To better plan
and incorporate the use of multiple sources in generating personalized
response, we firstly decompose it into three sub-tasks: Knowledge Source
Selection, Knowledge Retrieval, and Response Generation. We then propose a
novel Unified Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (UniMS-RAG)
Specifically, we unify these three sub-tasks with different formulations into
the same sequence-to-sequence paradigm during the training, to adaptively
retrieve evidences and evaluate the relevance on-demand using special tokens,
called acting tokens and evaluation tokens. Enabling language models to
generate acting tokens facilitates interaction with various knowledge sources,
allowing them to adapt their behavior to diverse task requirements. Meanwhile,
evaluation tokens gauge the relevance score between the dialogue context and
the retrieved evidence. In addition, we carefully design a self-refinement
mechanism to iteratively refine the generated response considering 1) the
consistency scores between the generated response and retrieved evidence; and
2) the relevance scores. Experiments on two personalized datasets (DuLeMon and
KBP) show that UniMS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the knowledge
source selection and response generation task with itself as a retriever in a
unified manner. Extensive analyses and discussions are provided for shedding
some new perspectives for personalized dialogue systems.

<p class="mathjax">The prevalent approach in speech emotion recognition (SER) involves
integrating both audio and textual information to comprehensively identify the
speaker's emotion, with the text generally obtained through automatic speech
recognition (ASR). An essential issue of this approach is that ASR errors from
the text modality can worsen the performance of SER. Previous studies have
proposed using an auxiliary ASR error detection task to adaptively assign
weights of each word in ASR hypotheses. However, this approach has limited
improvement potential because it does not address the coherence of semantic
information in the text. Additionally, the inherent heterogeneity of different
modalities leads to distribution gaps between their representations, making
their fusion challenging. Therefore, in this paper, we incorporate two
auxiliary tasks, ASR error detection (AED) and ASR error correction (AEC), to
enhance the semantic coherence of ASR text, and further introduce a novel
multi-modal fusion (MF) method to learn shared representations across
modalities. We refer to our method as MF-AED-AEC. Experimental results indicate
that MF-AED-AEC significantly outperforms the baseline model by a margin of
4.1\%.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchains deploy Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to determine which user
transactions to include in blocks and determine their payments (i.e.,
transaction fees). Increasing demand and scarce block resources have led to
high user transaction fees. As these blockchains are a public resource, it may
be preferable to reduce these transaction fees. To this end, we introduce
Transaction Fee Redistribution Mechanisms (TFRMs) -- redistributing VCG
payments collected from such TFM as rebates to minimize transaction fees.
Classic redistribution mechanisms (RMs) achieve this while ensuring Allocative
Efficiency (AE) and User Incentive Compatibility (UIC). Our first result shows
the non-triviality of applying RM in TFMs. More concretely, we prove that it is
impossible to reduce transaction fees when (i) transactions that are not
confirmed do not receive rebates and (ii) the miner can strategically
manipulate the mechanism. Driven by this, we propose \emph{Robust} TFRM
(\textsf{R-TFRM}): a mechanism that compromises on an honest miner's individual
rationality to guarantee strictly positive rebates to the users. We then
introduce \emph{robust} and \emph{rational} TFRM (\textsf{R}$^2$\textsf{-TFRM})
that uses trusted on-chain randomness that additionally guarantees miner's
individual rationality (in expectation) and strictly positive rebates. Our
results show that TFRMs provide a promising new direction for reducing
transaction fees in public blockchains.

<p class="mathjax">Recently,the detection transformer has gained substantial attention for its
inherent minimal post-processing requirement.However,this paradigm relies on
abundant training data,yet in the context of the cross-domain
adaptation,insufficient labels in the target domain exacerbate issues of class
imbalance and model performance degradation.To address these challenges, we
propose a novel class-aware cross domain detection transformer based on the
adversarial learning and mean-teacher framework.First,considering the
inconsistencies between the classification and regression tasks,we introduce an
IoU-aware prediction branch and exploit the consistency of classification and
location scores to filter and reweight pseudo labels.Second, we devise a
dynamic category threshold refinement to adaptively manage model
confidence.Third,to alleviate the class imbalance,an instance-level class-aware
contrastive learning module is presented to encourage the generation of
discriminative features for each class,particularly benefiting minority
classes.Experimental results across diverse domain-adaptive scenarios validate
our method's effectiveness in improving performance and alleviating class
imbalance issues,which outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer based
methods.

<p class="mathjax">The development of architecture specifications is an initial and fundamental
stage of the integrated circuit (IC) design process. Traditionally,
architecture specifications are crafted by experienced chip architects, a
process that is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. Mistakes in these
specifications may significantly affect subsequent stages of chip design.
Despite the presence of advanced electronic design automation (EDA) tools,
effective solutions to these specification-related challenges remain scarce.
Since writing architecture specifications is naturally a natural language
processing (NLP) task, this paper pioneers the automation of architecture
specification development with the advanced capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Leveraging our definition and dataset, we explore the
application of LLMs in two key aspects of architecture specification
development: (1) Generating architecture specifications, which includes both
writing specifications from scratch and converting RTL code into detailed
specifications. (2) Reviewing existing architecture specifications. We got
promising results indicating that LLMs may revolutionize how these critical
specification documents are developed in IC design nowadays. By reducing the
effort required, LLMs open up new possibilities for efficiency and accuracy in
this crucial aspect of chip design.

<p class="mathjax">With increasing reliance on medical imaging in clinical practices, automated
report generation from medical images is in great demand. Existing report
generation methods typically adopt an encoder-decoder deep learning framework
to build a uni-directional image-to-report mapping. However, such a framework
ignores the bi-directional mutual associations between images and reports, thus
incurring difficulties in associating the intrinsic medical meanings between
them. Recent generative representation learning methods have demonstrated the
benefits of dual-modal learning from both image and text modalities. However,
these methods exhibit two major drawbacks for medical report generation: 1)
they tend to capture morphological information and have difficulties in
capturing subtle pathological semantic information, and 2) they predict masked
text rely on both unmasked images and text, inevitably degrading performance
when inference is based solely on images. In this study, we propose a new
report generation framework with dual-modal dynamic traceback learning (DTrace)
to overcome the two identified drawbacks and enable dual-modal learning for
medical report generation. To achieve this, our DTrace introduces a traceback
mechanism to control the semantic validity of generated content via
self-assessment. Further, our DTrace introduces a dynamic learning strategy to
adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling report
generation without reliance on textual input during inference. Extensive
experiments on two well-benchmarked datasets (IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR) show that
our DTrace outperforms state-of-the-art medical report generation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Loss allocation of the three different components (conductor, sheaths and
armor) of solidly bonded three-core separated lead-sheathed armored cables,
frequently employed in offshore wind farms, is challenging due to the lack of
accurate enough analytical expressions in the IEC standard. Also, loss
allocation through experimental tests leads to inaccurate results since it is
based on questionable assumptions. This paper improves both the IEC formulae
and experimental methods by means of different analytical corrections in the
conductor and sheath loss expressions. To this aim, an ad hoc application
interface (Virtual Lab) based on 3D numerical simulations (finite element
method) has been developed. This tool virtualizes and automates different test
setups to emulate, in few seconds, the most employed experimental procedures in
this type of cable. The analytical corrections have been derived from an
in-depth analysis of a first set of 368 cables, ranging from 30 to 275 kV. The
new loss expressions were successfully applied to a second set of 645 armored
cables of quite diverse features (voltages from 10 to 275 kV, sections and
dimensional parameters), hence bringing a general framework for any kind of
three-core armored cable.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic image colorization is inherently an ill-posed problem with
uncertainty, which requires an accurate semantic understanding of scenes to
estimate reasonable colors for grayscale images. Although recent
interaction-based methods have achieved impressive performance, it is still a
very difficult task to infer realistic and accurate colors for automatic
colorization. To reduce the difficulty of semantic understanding of grayscale
scenes, this paper tries to utilize corresponding audio, which naturally
contains extra semantic information about the same scene. Specifically, a novel
audio-infused automatic image colorization (AIAIC) network is proposed, which
consists of three stages. First, we take color image semantics as a bridge and
pretrain a colorization network guided by color image semantics. Second, the
natural co-occurrence of audio and video is utilized to learn the color
semantic correlations between audio and visual scenes. Third, the implicit
audio semantic representation is fed into the pretrained network to finally
realize the audio-guided colorization. The whole process is trained in a
self-supervised manner without human annotation. In addition, an audiovisual
colorization dataset is established for training and testing. Experiments
demonstrate that audio guidance can effectively improve the performance of
automatic colorization, especially for some scenes that are difficult to
understand only from visual modality.

geometric identities to describe the planar Willmore flow: the first one
involves the coupling of the outward unit normal vector $\boldsymbol{n}$ and
the normal velocity $V$, and the second one concerns the time derivative of the
mean curvature $\kappa$. Based on them, we derive a set of new geometric
partial differential equations for the planar Willmore flow, leading to our new

<p class="mathjax">Recently, AI assistants based on large language models (LLMs) show surprising
performance in many tasks, such as dialogue, solving math problems, writing
code, and using tools. Although LLMs possess intensive world knowledge, they
still make factual errors when facing some knowledge intensive tasks, like
open-domain question answering. These untruthful responses from the AI
assistant may cause significant risks in practical applications. We believe
that an AI assistant's refusal to answer questions it does not know is a
crucial method for reducing hallucinations and making the assistant truthful.
Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question "Can AI assistants know what they
don't know and express them through natural language?" To answer this question,
we construct a model-specific "I don't know" (Idk) dataset for an assistant,
which contains its known and unknown questions, based on existing open-domain
question answering datasets. Then we align the assistant with its corresponding
Idk dataset and observe whether it can refuse to answer its unknown questions
after alignment. Experimental results show that after alignment with Idk
datasets, the assistant can refuse to answer most its unknown questions. For
questions they attempt to answer, the accuracy is significantly higher than
before the alignment.

<p class="mathjax">Skin tone as a demographic bias and inconsistent human labeling poses
challenges in dermatology AI. We take another angle to investigate color
contrast's impact, beyond skin tones, on malignancy detection in skin disease
datasets: We hypothesize that in addition to skin tones, the color difference
between the lesion area and skin also plays a role in malignancy detection
performance of dermatology AI models. To study this, we first propose a robust
labeling method to quantify color contrast scores of each image and validate
our method by showing small labeling variations. More importantly, applying our
method to \textit{the only} diverse-skin tone and pathologically-confirmed skin
disease dataset DDI, yields \textbf{DDI-CoCo Dataset}, and we observe a
performance gap between the high and low color difference groups. This
disparity remains consistent across various state-of-the-art (SoTA) image
classification models, which supports our hypothesis. Furthermore, we study the
interaction between skin tone and color difference effects and suggest that
color difference can be an additional reason behind model performance bias
between skin tones. Our work provides a complementary angle to dermatology AI
for improving skin disease detection.

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting complex system dynamics, particularly for long-term predictions,
is persistently hindered by error accumulation and computational burdens. This
study presents RefreshNet, a multiscale framework developed to overcome these
challenges, delivering an unprecedented balance between computational
efficiency and predictive accuracy. RefreshNet incorporates convolutional
autoencoders to identify a reduced order latent space capturing essential
features of the dynamics, and strategically employs multiple recurrent neural
network (RNN) blocks operating at varying temporal resolutions within the
latent space, thus allowing the capture of latent dynamics at multiple temporal
scales. The unique "refreshing" mechanism in RefreshNet allows coarser blocks
to reset inputs of finer blocks, effectively controlling and alleviating error
accumulation. This design demonstrates superiority over existing techniques
regarding computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, especially in
long-term forecasting. The framework is validated using three benchmark
applications: the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, the Reaction-Diffusion equation, and
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dynamics. RefreshNet significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in long-term forecasting accuracy and speed, marking a
significant advancement in modeling complex systems and opening new avenues in
understanding and predicting their behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Single Object Tracking in LiDAR point cloud is one of the most essential
parts of environmental perception, in which small objects are inevitable in
real-world scenarios and will bring a significant barrier to the accurate
location. However, the existing methods concentrate more on exploring universal
architectures for common categories and overlook the challenges that small
objects have long been thorny due to the relative deficiency of foreground
points and a low tolerance for disturbances. To this end, we propose a Siamese
network-based method for small object tracking in the LiDAR point cloud, which
is composed of the target-awareness prototype mining (TAPM) module and the
regional grid subdivision (RGS) module. The TAPM module adopts the
reconstruction mechanism of the masked decoder to learn the prototype in the
feature space, aiming to highlight the presence of foreground points that will
facilitate the subsequent location of small objects. Through the above
prototype is capable of accentuating the small object of interest, the
positioning deviation in feature maps still leads to high tracking errors. To
alleviate this issue, the RGS module is proposed to recover the fine-grained
features of the search region based on ViT and pixel shuffle layers. In
addition, apart from the normal settings, we elaborately design a scaling
experiment to evaluate the robustness of the different trackers on small
objects. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes demonstrate that our
method can effectively improve the tracking performance of small targets
without affecting normal-sized objects.

usage of complex temporal patterns operated in cinema to produce the cognitive
perception of objectification. We introduce the ObyGaze12 dataset, made of 1914

<p class="mathjax">The age of social media is flooded with Internet memes, necessitating a clear
grasp and effective identification of harmful ones. This task presents a
significant challenge due to the implicit meaning embedded in memes, which is
not explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image. However, existing
harmful meme detection methods do not present readable explanations that unveil
such implicit meaning to support their detection decisions. In this paper, we
propose an explainable approach to detect harmful memes, achieved through
reasoning over conflicting rationales from both harmless and harmful positions.
Specifically, inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs)
on text generation and reasoning, we first elicit multimodal debate between
LLMs to generate the explanations derived from the contradictory arguments.
Then we propose to fine-tune a small language model as the debate judge for
harmfulness inference, to facilitate multimodal fusion between the harmfulness
rationales and the intrinsic multimodal information within memes. In this way,
our model is empowered to perform dialectical reasoning over intricate and
implicit harm-indicative patterns, utilizing multimodal explanations
originating from both harmless and harmful arguments. Extensive experiments on
three public meme datasets demonstrate that our harmful meme detection approach
achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a
superior capacity for explaining the meme harmfulness of the model predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Background and purpose: The unanticipated detection by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) in the brain of asymptomatic subjects of white matter lesions
suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been named radiologically isolated
syndrome (RIS). As the difference between early MS [i.e. clinically isolated
syndrome (CIS)] and RIS is the occurrence of a clinical event, it is logical to
improve detection of the subclinical form without interfering with MRI as there
are radiological diagnostic criteria for that. Our objective was to use
machine-learning classification methods to identify morphometric measures that
help to discriminate patients with RIS from those with CIS.
<br />Methods: We used a multimodal 3-T MRI approach by combining MRI biomarkers
(cortical thickness, cortical and subcortical grey matter volume, and white
matter integrity) of a cohort of 17 patients with RIS and 17 patients with CIS
for single-subject level classification.
<br />Results: The best proposed models to predict the diagnosis of CIS and RIS
were based on the Naive Bayes, Bagging and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers
using only three features: the left rostral middle frontal gyrus volume and the
fractional anisotropy values in the right amygdala and right lingual gyrus. The
Naive Bayes obtained the highest accuracy [overall classification, 0.765; area
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), 0.782].
<br />Conclusions: A machine-learning approach applied to multimodal MRI data may
differentiate between the earliest clinical expressions of MS (CIS and RIS)
with an accuracy of 78%.

<p class="mathjax">In this report we explore the application of the Lagrange-Newton method to
the SAM (smoothing-and-mapping) problem in mobile robotics. In Lagrange-Newton
SAM, the angular component of each pose vector is expressed by orientation
vectors and treated through Lagrange constraints. This is different from the
typical Gauss-Newton approach where variations need to be mapped back and forth
between Euclidean space and a manifold suitable for rotational components. We
derive equations for five different types of measurements between robot poses:
translation, distance, and rotation from odometry in the plane, as well as
home-vector angle and compass angle from visual homing. We demonstrate the
feasibility of the Lagrange-Newton approach for a simple example related to a
cleaning robot scenario.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we establish a baseline for a new task named multimodal
multi-round referring and grounding (MRG), opening up a promising direction for
instance-level multimodal dialogues. We present a new benchmark and an
efficient vision-language model for this purpose. The new benchmark, named
CB-300K, spans challenges including multi-round dialogue, complex spatial
relationships among multiple instances, and consistent reasoning, which are
beyond those shown in existing benchmarks. The proposed model, named
ChatterBox, utilizes a two-branch architecture to collaboratively handle vision
and language tasks. By tokenizing instance regions, the language branch
acquires the ability to perceive referential information. Meanwhile, ChatterBox
feeds a query embedding in the vision branch to a token receiver for visual
grounding. A two-stage optimization strategy is devised, making use of both
CB-300K and auxiliary external data to improve the model's stability and
capacity for instance-level understanding. Experiments show that ChatterBox
outperforms existing models in MRG both quantitatively and qualitatively,
paving a new path towards multimodal dialogue scenarios with complicated and
precise interactions. Code, data, and model are available at:

of data that need to be analysed efficiently, to study the fundamental
structures of our universe. ROOT is an open-source C++ data analysis framework,
developed for this purpose. Its high-level data analysis interface, RDataFrame,
currently only supports CPU parallelism. Given the increasing heterogeneity in
computing facilities, it becomes crucial to efficiently support GPGPUs to take
advantage of the available resources. SYCL allows for a single-source
implementation, which enables support for different architectures. In this
paper, we describe a CUDA implementation and the migration process to SYCL,
focusing on a core high energy physics operation in RDataFrame --
histogramming. We detail the challenges that we faced when integrating SYCL
into a large and complex code base. Furthermore, we perform an extensive
comparative performance analysis of two SYCL compilers, AdaptiveCpp and DPC++,
and the reference CUDA implementation. We highlight the performance bottlenecks
that we encountered, and the methodology used to detect these. Based on our
findings, we provide actionable insights for developers of SYCL applications.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in AI have led to the development of large multimodal
models (LMMs) capable of processing complex tasks involving joint reasoning
over text and visual content in the image (e.g., navigating maps in public
places). This paper introduces ConTextual, a novel benchmark comprising
instructions designed explicitly to evaluate LMMs' ability to perform
context-sensitive text-rich visual reasoning. ConTextual emphasizes diverse
real-world scenarios (e.g., time-reading, navigation, shopping and more)
demanding a deeper understanding of the interactions between textual and visual
elements. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap of 30.8% between
the best-performing LMM, GPT-4V(ision), and human capabilities using human
evaluation indicating substantial room for improvement in context-sensitive
text-rich visual reasoning. Notably, while GPT-4V excelled in abstract
categories like meme and quote interpretation, its overall performance still
lagged behind humans. In addition to human evaluations, we also employed
automatic evaluation metrics using GPT-4, uncovering similar trends in
performance disparities. We also perform a fine-grained evaluation across
diverse visual contexts and provide qualitative analysis which provides a
robust framework for future advancements in the LMM design.

<p class="mathjax">The great expansion in offshore power plants is raising the concern regarding
the cumulative effect of the electromagnetic field emissions caused by
submarine power cables. In this sense, owners are required to predict these
emissions during the permitting and consenting process of new power plants.
This is a challenging task, especially in the case of HVAC three-core armored
cables due to their complex geometry. Customarily, 2D approaches based on the
finite element method (FEM) have been employed for evaluating the magnetic
field emissions caused by these cables. However, inaccurate results are
obtained since the phase conductors and armor twisting is omitted. This work
develops, for the first time in the literature, an in-depth analysis of the
magnetic field caused by this type of cable through an ultra-shortened 3D-FEM
model, which is also faced to experimental measurements taken on an actual 132
kV, 800 mm2 three-core armored cable. Relevant conclusions are derived
regarding the impact of the cable design on the magnetic field emissions,
including material properties, as well as single and double-layer armors,
presenting the proposed model not only as a valuable tool for predicting
purposes, but also for optimizing cable design in terms of magnetic field
emissions.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of completing various visual document understanding
(VDU) tasks, e.g., question answering and information extraction, on real-world
documents through human-written instructions. To this end, we propose
InstructDoc, the first large-scale collection of 30 publicly available VDU
datasets, each with diverse instructions in a unified format, which covers a
wide range of 12 tasks and includes open document types/formats. Furthermore,
to enhance the generalization performance on VDU tasks, we design a new
instruction-based document reading and understanding model, InstructDr, that
connects document images, image encoders, and large language models (LLMs)
through a trainable bridging module. Experiments demonstrate that InstructDr
can effectively adapt to new VDU datasets, tasks, and domains via given
instructions and outperforms existing multimodal LLMs and ChatGPT without

<p class="mathjax">The dark web has become notorious for its association with illicit activities
and there is a growing need for systems to automate the monitoring of this
space. This paper proposes an end-to-end scalable architecture for the early
identification of new Tor sites and the daily analysis of their content. The
solution is built using an Open Source Big Data stack for data serving with
Kubernetes, Kafka, Kubeflow, and MinIO, continuously discovering onion
addresses in different sources (threat intelligence, code repositories, web-Tor
gateways, and Tor repositories), downloading the HTML from Tor and
deduplicating the content using MinHash LSH, and categorizing with the BERTopic
modeling (SBERT embedding, UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN document
clustering and c-TF-IDF topic keywords). In 93 days, the system identified
80,049 onion services and characterized 90% of them, addressing the challenge
of Tor volatility. A disproportionate amount of repeated content is found, with
only 6.1% unique sites. From the HTML files of the dark sites, 31 different
low-topics are extracted, manually labeled, and grouped into 11 high-level
topics. The five most popular included sexual and violent content,
repositories, search engines, carding, cryptocurrencies, and marketplaces.
During the experiments, we identified 14 sites with 13,946 clones that shared a
suspiciously similar mirroring rate per day, suggesting an extensive common
phishing network. Among the related works, this study is the most
representative characterization of onion services based on topics to date.

<p class="mathjax">Explanations of AI systems rarely address the information needs of people
affected by algorithmic decision-making (ADM). This gap between conveyed
information and information that matters to affected stakeholders can impede
understanding and adherence to regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act. To
address this gap, we present the "XAI Novice Question Bank": A catalog of
affected stakeholders' information needs in two ADM use cases (employment
prediction and health monitoring), covering the categories data, system
context, system usage, and system specifications. Information needs were
gathered in an interview study where participants received explanations in
response to their inquiries. Participants further reported their understanding
and decision confidence, showing that while confidence tended to increase after
receiving explanations, participants also met understanding challenges, such as
being unable to tell why their understanding felt incomplete. Explanations
further influenced participants' perceptions of the systems' risks and
benefits, which they confirmed or changed depending on the use case. When risks
were perceived as high, participants expressed particular interest in
explanations about intention, such as why and to what end a system was put in
place. With this work, we aim to support the inclusion of affected stakeholders
into explainability by contributing an overview of information and challenges
relevant to them when deciding on the adoption of ADM systems. We close by
summarizing our findings in a list of six key implications that inform the
design of future explanations for affected stakeholder audiences.

<p class="mathjax">Generalized category discovery (GCD) aims at addressing a more realistic and
challenging setting of semi-supervised learning, where only part of the
category labels are assigned to certain training samples. Previous methods
generally employ naive contrastive learning or unsupervised clustering scheme
for all the samples. Nevertheless, they usually ignore the inherent critical
information within the historical predictions of the model being trained.
Specifically, we empirically reveal that a significant number of salient
unlabeled samples yield consistent historical predictions corresponding to
their ground truth category. From this observation, we propose a Memory
Consistency guided Divide-and-conquer Learning framework (MCDL). In this
framework, we introduce two memory banks to record historical prediction of
unlabeled data, which are exploited to measure the credibility of each sample
in terms of its prediction consistency. With the guidance of credibility, we
can design a divide-and-conquer learning strategy to fully utilize the
discriminative information of unlabeled data while alleviating the negative
influence of noisy labels. Extensive experimental results on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the generality and superiority of our method, where our
method outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large margin on both seen and
unseen classes of the generic image recognition and challenging semantic shift
settings (i.e.,with +8.4% gain on CUB and +8.1% on Standford Cars).

<p class="mathjax">Smartwatch health sensor data is increasingly utilized in smart health
applications and patient monitoring, including stress detection. However, such
medical data often comprises sensitive personal information and is
resource-intensive to acquire for research purposes. In response to this
challenge, we introduce the privacy-aware synthetization of multi-sensor
smartwatch health readings related to moments of stress. Our method involves
the generation of synthetic sequence data through Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), coupled with the implementation of Differential Privacy (DP)
safeguards for protecting patient information during model training. To ensure
the integrity of our synthetic data, we employ a range of quality assessments
and monitor the plausibility between synthetic and original data. To test the
usefulness, we create private machine learning models on a commonly used,
albeit small, stress detection dataset, exploring strategies for enhancing the
existing data foundation with our synthetic data. Through our GAN-based
augmentation methods, we observe improvements in model performance, both in
non-private (0.45% F1) and private (11.90-15.48% F1) training scenarios. We
underline the potential of differentially private synthetic data in optimizing
utility-privacy trade-offs, especially with limited availability of real
training samples.

by looking at how the cut-rank (as introduced by Oum) of subsets is affected
when going from the input structure to the output structure. We consider
transformations in which the underlying sets are the same for both the input
and output, and so the cut-ranks of subsets can be easily compared. The purpose
of this paper is to give a characterisation of logically defined transductions
that is expressed in purely structural terms, without referring to logic:
transformations which decrease the cut-rank, in the asymptotic sense, are
exactly those that can be defined in monadic second-order logic. This
characterisation assumes that the transduction has inputs of bounded treewidth;
we also show that the characterisation fails in the absence of any assumptions.

<p class="mathjax">Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) requires precise modelling of fine-grained
moment-text associations to capture intricate visual-language relationships.
Due to the lack of a diverse and generalisable VMR dataset to facilitate
learning scalable moment-text associations, existing methods resort to joint
training on both source and target domain videos for cross-domain applications.
Meanwhile, recent developments in vision-language multimodal models pre-trained
on large-scale image-text and/or video-text pairs are only based on coarse
associations (weakly labelled). They are inadequate to provide fine-grained
moment-text correlations required for cross-domain VMR. In this work, we solve
the problem of unseen cross-domain VMR, where certain visual and textual
concepts do not overlap across domains, by only utilising target domain
sentences (text prompts) without accessing their videos. To that end, we
explore generative video diffusion for fine-grained editing of source videos
controlled by the target sentences, enabling us to simulate target domain
videos. We address two problems in video editing for optimising unseen domain
VMR: (1) generation of high-quality simulation videos of different moments with
subtle distinctions, (2) selection of simulation videos that complement
existing source training videos without introducing harmful noise or
unnecessary repetitions. On the first problem, we formulate a two-stage video
diffusion generation controlled simultaneously by (1) the original video
structure of a source video, (2) subject specifics, and (3) a target sentence
prompt. This ensures fine-grained variations between video moments. On the
second problem, we introduce a hybrid selection mechanism that combines two
quantitative metrics for noise filtering and one qualitative metric for
leveraging VMR prediction on simulation video selection.

<p class="mathjax">Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN)
with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate
points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved.
This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex
and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including
the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the
EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive
NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully
automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone
and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural
Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks
(NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying
constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC)
operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this
provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible
(i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best
tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the
models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs.
Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel
regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers
of the EENN

collaborative parameter tuning of cyber-physical systems. However, BO's
solutions may deviate from human experts' actual goal due to approximation
errors and simplified objectives, requiring subsequent tuning. The black-box
nature of BO limits the collaborative tuning process because the expert does
not trust the BO recommendations. Current explainable AI (XAI) methods are not
tailored for optimization and thus fall short of addressing this gap. To bridge
this gap, we propose TNTRules (TUNE-NOTUNE Rules), a post-hoc, rule-based
explainability method that produces high quality explanations through
multiobjective optimization. Our evaluation of benchmark optimization problems
and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrates TNTRules'
superiority over state-of-the-art XAI methods in generating high quality
explanations. This work contributes to the intersection of BO and XAI,
providing interpretable optimization techniques for real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">Depth perception in volumetric visualization plays a crucial role in the
understanding and interpretation of volumetric data. Numerous visualization
techniques, many of which rely on physically based optical effects, promise to
improve depth perception but often do so without considering camera movement or
the content of the volume. As a result, the findings from previous studies may
not be directly applicable to crowded volumes, where a large number of
contained structures disrupts spatial perception. Crowded volumes therefore
require special analysis and visualization tools with sparsification
capabilities. Interactivity is an integral part of visualizing and exploring
crowded spaces, but has received little attention in previous studies. To
address this gap, we conducted a study to assess the impact of different
rendering techniques on depth perception in crowded volumes, with a particular
focus on the effects of camera movement. The results show that depth perception
considering camera motion depends much more on the content of the volume than
on the chosen visualization technique. Furthermore, we found that traditional
rendering techniques, which have often performed poorly in previous studies,
showed comparable performance to physically based methods in our study.

<p class="mathjax">Symbolic Computation algorithms and their implementation in computer algebra
systems often contain choices which do not affect the correctness of the output
but can significantly impact the resources required: such choices can benefit
from having them made separately for each problem via a machine learning model.
This study reports lessons on such use of machine learning in symbolic
computation, in particular on the importance of analysing datasets prior to
machine learning and on the different machine learning paradigms that may be
utilised. We present results for a particular case study, the selection of
variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition, but expect that the
lessons learned are applicable to other decisions in symbolic computation.
<br />We utilise an existing dataset of examples derived from applications which
was found to be imbalanced with respect to the variable ordering decision. We
introduce an augmentation technique for polynomial systems problems that allows
us to balance and further augment the dataset, improving the machine learning
results by 28\% and 38\% on average, respectively. We then demonstrate how the
existing machine learning methodology used for the problem $-$ classification
$-$ might be recast into the regression paradigm. While this does not have a
radical change on the performance, it does widen the scope in which the
methodology can be applied to make choices.

incorporating over 200 multi-sensor multi-wireless nodes, 20 collaborative

presented in detail: 1) An automated streetlight monitoring for detecting
issues and triggering maintenance alerts; 2) A Digital twin of building
environments providing enhanced air quality sensing with reduced cost; 3) A
large-scale Federated Learning framework for reducing communication overhead;
and 4) An intrusion detection for containerised applications identifying
malicious activities. Additionally, the potential of UMBRELLA is outlined for
future smart city and multi-robot crowdsensing applications enhanced by
semantic communications and multi-agent planning. Finally, to realise the above
use-cases we discuss the need for a tailored MLOps platform to automate

cases it may also harms it. If we are able to predict and therefore to disable
personalization for those situations, the overall performance will be higher
and users will be more satisfied with personalized systems. We use some
state-of-the-art pre-retrieval query performance predictors and propose some
others including the user profile information for the previous purpose. We
study the correlations among these predictors and the difference between the
personalized and the original queries. We also use classification and

one third of the maximum ideal performance. We think this is a good starting

Networking plays a key role in enabling remoting. However, for efficient
remoting, the network requirements in terms of latency and bandwidth are
unknown. In this paper, we take a GPU-centric approach to derive the minimum
latency and bandwidth requirements for GPU remoting, while ensuring no (or
little) performance degradation for AI applications. Our study including
theoretical model demonstrates that, with careful remoting design, unmodified
AI applications can run on the remoting setup using commodity networking

<p class="mathjax">In conventional finite element simulations, foil windings with a thin foil
and many turns require many mesh elements. This renders models quickly
computationally infeasible. With the use of homogenization approaches, the
finite element mesh does not need to resolve the small-scale structure of the
foil winding domain. Present homogenization approaches take resistive and
inductive effects into account. With an increase of the operation frequency of
foil windings, however, capacitive effects between adjacent turns in the foil
winding become relevant. This paper presents an extension to the standard foil
winding model that covers the capacitive behavior of foil windings.

<p class="mathjax">How to efficiently and accurately handle image matching outliers is a
critical issue in two-view relative estimation. The prevailing RANSAC method
necessitates that the minimal point pairs be inliers. This paper introduces a
linear relative pose estimation algorithm for n $( n \geq 6$) point pairs,
which is founded on the recent pose-only imaging geometry to filter out
outliers by proper reweighting. The proposed algorithm is able to handle planar
degenerate scenes, and enhance robustness and accuracy in the presence of a
substantial ratio of outliers. Specifically, we embed the linear global
translation (LiGT) constraint into the strategies of iteratively reweighted
least-squares (IRLS) and RANSAC so as to realize robust outlier removal.
Simulations and real tests of the Strecha dataset show that the proposed
algorithm achieves relative rotation accuracy improvement of 2 $\sim$ 10 times
in face of as large as 80% outliers.

problem of finding settings for optical switches augmenting a static network so
as to achieve optimal delivery of some given workload. The problem has
previously been studied in various scenarios with both tractable and
NP-hardness results obtained. However, the data center and interconnection
networks to which the problem is most relevant are almost always such that the
static network is highly structured whereas all previous results assume that
the static network can be arbitrary (which makes existing computational
hardness results less technologically relevant and also easier to obtain). In

<p class="mathjax">Learning with noisy labels aims to ensure model generalization given a
label-corrupted training set. The sample selection strategy achieves promising
performance by selecting a label-reliable subset for model training. In this
paper, we empirically reveal that existing sample selection methods suffer from
both data and training bias that are represented as imbalanced selected sets
and accumulation errors in practice, respectively. However, only the training
bias was handled in previous studies. To address this limitation, we propose a
noIse-Tolerant Expert Model (ITEM) for debiased learning in sample selection.
Specifically, to mitigate the training bias, we design a robust network
architecture that integrates with multiple experts. Compared with the
prevailing double-branch network, our network exhibits better performance of
selection and prediction by ensembling these experts while training with fewer
parameters. Meanwhile, to mitigate the data bias, we propose a mixed sampling
strategy based on two weight-based data samplers. By training on the mixture of
two class-discriminative mini-batches, the model mitigates the effect of the
imbalanced training set while avoiding sparse representations that are easily
caused by sampling strategies. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate
the effectiveness of ITEM. Our code is available at this url

<p class="mathjax">In this note we consider the approximation of the Greeks Delta and Gamma of
American-style options through the numerical solution of time-dependent partial
differential complementarity problems (PDCPs). This approach is very attractive
as it can yield accurate approximations to these Greeks at essentially no
additional computational cost during the numerical solution of the PDCP for the
pertinent option value function. For the temporal discretization, the
Crank-Nicolson method is arguably the most popular method in computational
finance. It is well-known, however, that this method can have an undesirable
convergence behaviour in the approximation of the Greeks Delta and Gamma for
American-style options, even when backward Euler damping (Rannacher smoothing)
is employed.
<br />In this note we study for the temporal discretization an interesting family
of diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods together with the two-stage
Lobatto IIIC method. Through ample numerical experiments for one- and two-asset
American-style options, it is shown that these methods can yield a regular
second-order convergence behaviour for the option value as well as for the
Greeks Delta and Gamma. A mutual comparison reveals that the DIRK method with
suitably chosen parameter $\theta$ is preferable.

<p class="mathjax">Approaching robotic cloth manipulation using reinforcement learning based on
visual feedback is appealing as robot perception and control can be learned
simultaneously. However, major challenges result due to the intricate dynamics
of cloth and the high dimensionality of the corresponding states, what shadows
the practicality of the idea. To tackle these issues, we propose TraKDis, a
novel Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation approach that decomposes the
visual reinforcement learning problem into two distinct stages. In the first
stage, a privileged agent is trained, which possesses complete knowledge of the
cloth state information. This privileged agent acts as a teacher, providing
valuable guidance and training signals for subsequent stages. The second stage
involves a knowledge distillation procedure, where the knowledge acquired by
the privileged agent is transferred to a vision-based agent by leveraging
pre-trained state estimation and weight initialization. TraKDis demonstrates
better performance when compared to state-of-the-art RL techniques, showing a
higher performance of 21.9%, 13.8%, and 8.3% in cloth folding tasks in
simulation. Furthermore, to validate robustness, we evaluate the agent in a
noisy environment; the results indicate its ability to handle and adapt to
environmental uncertainties effectively. Real robot experiments are also
conducted to showcase the efficiency of our method in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Human dance generation (HDG) aims to synthesize realistic videos from images
and sequences of driving poses. Despite great success, existing methods are
limited to generating videos of a single person with specific backgrounds,
while the generalizability for real-world scenarios with multiple persons and
complex backgrounds remains unclear. To systematically measure the
generalizability of HDG models, we introduce a new task, dataset, and
evaluation protocol of compositional human dance generation (cHDG). Evaluating
the state-of-the-art methods on cHDG, we empirically find that they fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel
zero-shot framework, dubbed MultiDance-Zero, that can synthesize videos
consistent with arbitrary multiple persons and background while precisely
following the driving poses. Specifically, in contrast to straightforward DDIM
or null-text inversion, we first present a pose-aware inversion method to
obtain the noisy latent code and initialization text embeddings, which can
accurately reconstruct the composed reference image. Since directly generating
videos from them will lead to severe appearance inconsistency, we propose a
compositional augmentation strategy to generate augmented images and utilize
them to optimize a set of generalizable text embeddings. In addition,
consistency-guided sampling is elaborated to encourage the background and
keypoints of the estimated clean image at each reverse step to be close to
those of the reference image, further improving the temporal consistency of
generated videos. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Engineering sciences, such as energy system research, play an important role
in developing solutions to technical, environmental, economic, and social
challenges of our modern society. In this context, the transformation of energy
systems into climate-neutral systems is one of the key strategies for
mitigating climate change. For the transformation of energy systems, engineers
model, simulate and analyze scenarios and transformation pathways to initiate
debates about possible transformation strategies. For these debates and
research in general, all steps of the research process must be traceable to
guarantee the trustworthiness of published results, avoid redundancies, and
ensure their social acceptance. However, the analysis of energy systems is an
interdisciplinary field as the investigations of large, complex energy systems
often require the use of different software applications and large amounts of
heterogeneous data. Engineers must therefore communicate, understand, and
(re)use heterogeneous scientific knowledge and data. Although the importance of
FAIR scientific knowledge and data in the engineering sciences and energy
system research is increasing, little research has been conducted on this
topic. When it comes to publishing scientific knowledge and data from
publications, software, and datasets (such as models, scenarios, and
simulations) openly available and transparent, energy system research lags
behind other research domains. According to Schmitt et al. and Nie{\ss}e et
al., engineers need technical support in the form of infrastructures, services,
and terminologies to improve communication, understanding, and (re)use of
scientific knowledge and data.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) systems face performance challenges in dealing with
heterogeneous devices and non-identically distributed data across clients. We
propose a dynamic global model aggregation method within Asynchronous Federated
Learning (AFL) deployments to address these issues. Our aggregation method
scores and adjusts the weighting of client model updates based on their upload
frequency to accommodate differences in device capabilities. Additionally, we
also immediately provide an updated global model to clients after they upload
their local models to reduce idle time and improve training efficiency. We
evaluate our approach within an AFL deployment consisting of 10 simulated
clients with heterogeneous compute constraints and non-IID data. The simulation
results, using the FashionMNIST dataset, demonstrate over 10% and 19%
improvement in global model accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods
PAPAYA and FedAsync, respectively. Our dynamic aggregation method allows
reliable global model training despite limiting client resources and
statistical data heterogeneity. This improves robustness and scalability for
real-world FL deployments.

<p class="mathjax">Logics for resource-bounded agents have been getting more and more attention
in recent years since they provide us with more realistic tools for modelling
and reasoning about multi-agent systems. While many existing approaches are
based on the idea of agents as imperfect reasoners, who must spend their
resources to perform logical inference, this is not the only way to introduce
resource constraints into logical settings. In this paper we study agents as
perfect reasoners, who may purchase a new piece of information from a
trustworthy source. For this purpose we propose dynamic epistemic logic for
semi-public queries for resource-bounded agents. In this logic (groups of)
agents can perform a query (ask a question) about whether some formula is true
and receive a correct answer. These queries are called semi-public, because the
very fact of the query is public, while the answer is private. We also assume
that every query has a cost and every agent has a budget constraint. Finally,
our framework allows us to reason about group queries, in which agents may
share resources to obtain a new piece of information together. We demonstrate
that our logic is complete, decidable and has an efficient model checking
procedure.

<p class="mathjax">Addressing the limitations of individual attribution scores via the Shapley
value (SV), the field of explainable AI (XAI) has recently explored intricate
interactions of features or data points. In particular,
\mbox{extensions}~of~the SV, such as the Shapley Interaction Index (SII), have
been proposed as a measure to still benefit from the axiomatic basis of the SV.
However, similar to the SV, their exact computation remains computationally
prohibitive. Hence, we propose with SVARM-IQ a sampling-based approach to
efficiently approximate Shapley-based interaction indices of any order.
SVARM-IQ can be applied to a broad class of interaction indices, including the
SII, by leveraging a novel stratified representation. We provide non-asymptotic
theoretical guarantees on its approximation quality and empirically demonstrate
that SVARM-IQ achieves state-of-the-art estimation results in practical XAI
scenarios on different model classes and application domains.

<p class="mathjax">Right-linear (or left-linear) grammars are a well-known class of context-free
grammars computing just the regular languages. They may naturally be written as
expressions with (least) fixed points but with products restricted to letters
as left arguments, giving an alternative to the syntax of regular expressions.
In this work, we investigate the resulting logical theory of this syntax.
Namely, we propose a theory of right-linear algebras (RLA) over of this syntax
and a cyclic proof system CRLA for reasoning about them.
<br />We show that CRLA is sound and complete for the intended model of regular
languages. From here we recover the same completeness result for RLA by
extracting inductive invariants from cyclic proofs, rendering the model of
regular languages the free right-linear algebra.
<br />Finally, we extend system CRLA by greatest fixed points, nuCRLA, naturally
modelled by languages of omega-words thanks to right-linearity. We show a
similar soundness and completeness result of (the guarded fragment of) nuCRLA
for the model of omega-regular languages, employing game theoretic techniques.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the fundamental problem of designing a truthful single-item
auction with the challenging objective of extracting a large fraction of the
highest agent valuation as revenue. Following a recent trend in algorithm
design, we assume that the agent valuations belong to a known interval, and a
(possibly erroneous) prediction for the highest valuation is available. Then,
auction design aims for high consistency and robustness, meaning that, for
appropriate pairs of values $\gamma$ and $\rho$, the extracted revenue should
be at least a $\gamma$- or $\rho$-fraction of the highest valuation when the
prediction is correct for the input instance or not. We characterize all pairs
of parameters $\gamma$ and $\rho$ so that a randomized $\gamma$-consistent and
$\rho$-robust auction exists. Furthermore, for the setting in which robustness
can be a function of the prediction error, we give sufficient and necessary
conditions for the existence of robust auctions and present randomized auctions
that extract a revenue that is only a polylogarithmic (in terms of the
prediction error) factor away from the highest agent valuation.

<p class="mathjax">Face recognition technology has been deployed in various real-life
applications. The most sophisticated deep learning-based face recognition
systems rely on training millions of face images through complex deep neural
networks to achieve high accuracy. It is quite common for clients to upload
face images to the service provider in order to access the model inference.
However, the face image is a type of sensitive biometric attribute tied to the
identity information of each user. Directly exposing the raw face image to the
service provider poses a threat to the user's privacy. Current
privacy-preserving approaches to face recognition focus on either concealing
visual information on model input or protecting model output face embedding.
The noticeable drop in recognition accuracy is a pitfall for most methods. This
paper proposes a hybrid frequency-color fusion approach to reduce the input
dimensionality of face recognition in the frequency domain. Moreover, sparse
color information is also introduced to alleviate significant accuracy
degradation after adding differential privacy noise. Besides, an
identity-specific embedding mapping scheme is applied to protect original face
embedding by enlarging the distance among identities. Lastly, secure multiparty
computation is implemented for safely computing the embedding distance during
model inference. The proposed method performs well on multiple widely used
verification datasets. Moreover, it has around 2.6% to 4.2% higher accuracy
than the state-of-the-art in the 1:N verification scenario.

<p class="mathjax">The year 1948 witnessed the historic moment of the birth of classic
information theory (CIT). Guided by CIT, modern communication techniques have
approached the theoretic limitations, such as, entropy function $H(U)$, channel
capacity $C=\max_{p(x)}I(X;Y)$ and rate-distortion function
$R(D)=\min_{p(\hat{x}|x):\mathbb{E}d(x,\hat{x})\leq D} I(X;\hat{X})$. Semantic
communication paves a new direction for future communication techniques whereas
the guided theory is missed. In this paper, we try to establish a systematic
framework of semantic information theory (SIT). We investigate the behavior of
semantic communication and find that synonym is the basic feature so we define
the synonymous mapping between semantic information and syntactic information.
Stemming from this core concept, synonymous mapping, we introduce the measures
of semantic information, such as semantic entropy $H_s(\tilde{U})$, up/down
semantic mutual information $I^s(\tilde{X};\tilde{Y})$
$(I_s(\tilde{X};\tilde{Y}))$, semantic capacity
$C_s=\max_{p(x)}I^s(\tilde{X};\tilde{Y})$, and semantic rate-distortion
function
$R_s(D)=\min_{p(\hat{x}|x):\mathbb{E}d_s(\tilde{x},\hat{\tilde{x}})\leq
D}I_s(\tilde{X};\hat{\tilde{X}})$. Furthermore, we prove three coding theorems
of SIT by using random coding and (jointly) typical decoding/encoding, that is,
the semantic source coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and
semantic rate-distortion coding theorem. We find that the limits of SIT are
extended by using synonymous mapping, that is, $H_s(\tilde{U})\leq H(U)$,
$C_s\geq C$ and $R_s(D)\leq R(D)$. All these works composite the basis of
semantic information theory. In addition, we discuss the semantic information
measures in the continuous case. Especially, for band-limited Gaussian channel,
we obtain a new channel capacity formula,
$C_s=B\log\left[S^4\left(1+\frac{P}{N_0B}\right)\right]$ with the synonymous
length $S$.

<p class="mathjax">Existing text-to-image diffusion models primarily generate images from text
prompts. However, the inherent conciseness of textual descriptions poses
challenges in faithfully synthesizing images with intricate details, such as
specific entities or scenes. This paper presents \textbf{UNIMO-G}, a simple
multimodal conditional diffusion framework that operates on multimodal prompts
with interleaved textual and visual inputs, which demonstrates a unified
ability for both text-driven and subject-driven image generation. UNIMO-G
comprises two core components: a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for
encoding multimodal prompts, and a conditional denoising diffusion network for
generating images based on the encoded multimodal input. We leverage a
two-stage training strategy to effectively train the framework: firstly
pre-training on large-scale text-image pairs to develop conditional image
generation capabilities, and then instruction tuning with multimodal prompts to
achieve unified image generation proficiency. A well-designed data processing
pipeline involving language grounding and image segmentation is employed to
construct multi-modal prompts. UNIMO-G excels in both text-to-image generation
and zero-shot subject-driven synthesis, and is notably effective in generating
high-fidelity images from complex multimodal prompts involving multiple image
entities.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence (AI) finds widespread applications across various
domains, sparking concerns about fairness in its deployment. While fairness in
AI remains a central concern, the prevailing discourse often emphasizes
outcome-based metrics without a nuanced consideration of the differential
impacts within subgroups. Bias mitigation techniques do not only affect the
ranking of pairs of instances across sensitive groups, but often also
significantly affect the ranking of instances within these groups. Such changes
are hard to explain and raise concerns regarding the validity of the
intervention. Unfortunately, these effects largely remain under the radar in
the accuracy-fairness evaluation framework that is usually applied. This paper
challenges the prevailing metrics for assessing bias mitigation techniques,
arguing that they do not take into account the changes within-groups and that
the resulting prediction labels fall short of reflecting real-world scenarios.
We propose a paradigm shift: initially, we should focus on generating the most
precise ranking for each subgroup. Following this, individuals should be chosen
from these rankings to meet both fairness standards and practical
considerations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the role of text categorization in streamlining
stopword extraction in natural language processing (NLP), specifically focusing
on nine African languages alongside French. By leveraging the MasakhaNEWS,
African Stopwords Project, and MasakhaPOS datasets, our findings emphasize that
text categorization effectively identifies domain-agnostic stopwords with over
80% detection success rate for most examined languages. Nevertheless,
linguistic variances result in lower detection rates for certain languages.
Interestingly, we find that while over 40% of stopwords are common across news
categories, less than 15% are unique to a single category. Uncommon stopwords
add depth to text but their classification as stopwords depends on context.
Therefore combining statistical and linguistic approaches creates comprehensive
stopword lists, highlighting the value of our hybrid method. This research
enhances NLP for African languages and underscores the importance of text
categorization in stopword extraction.

<p class="mathjax">The celebrated Kleene fixed point theorem is crucial in the mathematical
modelling of recursive specifications in Denotational Semantics. In this paper
we discuss whether the hypothesis of the aforementioned result can be weakened.
An affirmative answer to the aforesaid inquiry is provided so that a
characterization of those properties that a self-mapping must satisfy in order
to guarantee that its set of fixed points is non-empty when no notion of
completeness are assumed to be satisfied by the partially ordered set.
Moreover, the case in which the partially ordered set is coming from a
quasi-metric space is treated in depth. Finally, an application of the exposed
theory is obtained. Concretely, a mathematical method to discuss the asymptotic
complexity of those algorithms whose running time of computing fulfills a
recurrence equation is presented. Moreover, the aforesaid method retrieves the
fixed point based methods that appear in the literature for asymptotic
complexity analysis of algorithms. However, our new method improves the
aforesaid methods because it imposes fewer requirements than those that have
been assumed in the literature and, in addition, it allows to state
simultaneously upper and lower asymptotic bounds for the running time
computing.

<p class="mathjax">Object recognition and object pose estimation in robotic grasping continue to
be significant challenges, since building a labelled dataset can be time
consuming and financially costly in terms of data collection and annotation. In
this work, we propose a synthetic data generation method that minimizes human
intervention and makes downstream image segmentation algorithms more robust by
combining a generated synthetic dataset with a smaller real-world dataset
(hybrid dataset). Annotation experiments show that the proposed synthetic scene
generation can diminish labelling time dramatically. RGB image segmentation is
trained with hybrid dataset and combined with depth information to produce
pixel-to-point correspondence of individual segmented objects. The object to
grasp is then determined by the confidence score of the segmentation algorithm.
Pick-and-place experiments demonstrate that segmentation trained on our hybrid
dataset (98.9%, 70%) outperforms the real dataset and a publicly available
dataset by (6.7%, 18.8%) and (2.8%, 10%) in terms of labelling and grasping
success rate, respectively. Supplementary material is available at

<p class="mathjax">Understanding and effectively managing Technical Debt (TD) remains a vital
challenge in software engineering. While many studies on code-level TD have
been published, few illustrate the business impact of low-quality source code.
In this study, we combine two publicly available datasets to study the
association between code quality on the one hand, and defect count and
implementation time on the other hand. We introduce a value-creation model,
derived from regression analyses, to explore relative changes from a baseline.
Our results show that the associations vary across different intervals of code
quality. Furthermore, the value model suggests strong non-linearities at the
extremes of the code quality spectrum. Most importantly, the model suggests
amplified returns on investment in the upper end. We discuss the findings
within the context of the "broken windows" theory and recommend organizations
to diligently prevent the introduction of code smells in files with high churn.
Finally, we argue that the value-creation model can be used to initiate
discussions regarding the return on investment in refactoring efforts.

<p class="mathjax">Perception occurs when two individuals interpret the same information
differently. Despite being a known phenomenon with implications for bias in
decision-making, as individuals' experience determines interpretation,
perception remains largely overlooked in automated decision-making (ADM)
systems. In particular, it can have considerable effects on the fairness or
fair usage of an ADM system, as fairness itself is context-specific and its
interpretation dependent on who is judging. In this work, we formalize
perception under causal reasoning to capture the act of interpretation by an
individual. We also formalize individual experience as additional causal
knowledge that comes with and is used by an individual. Further, we define and
discuss loaded attributes, which are attributes prone to evoke perception.
Sensitive attributes, such as gender and race, are clear examples of loaded
attributes. We define two kinds of causal perception, unfaithful and
inconsistent, based on the causal properties of faithfulness and consistency.
We illustrate our framework through a series of decision-making examples and
discuss relevant fairness applications. The goal of this work is to position
perception as a parameter of interest, useful for extending the standard,
single interpretation ADM problem formulation.

<p class="mathjax">Data protection legislation like the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) establishes the \textit{right to be forgotten}: a user
(client) can request contributions made using their data to be removed from
learned models. In this paper, we study how to remove the contributions made by
a client participating in a Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR) system.
In a FOLTR system, a ranker is learned by aggregating local updates to the
global ranking model. Local updates are learned in an online manner at a
client-level using queries and implicit interactions that have occurred within
that specific client. By doing so, each client's local data is not shared with
other clients or with a centralised search service, while at the same time
clients can benefit from an effective global ranking model learned from
contributions of each client in the federation.
<br />In this paper, we study an effective and efficient unlearning method that can
remove a client's contribution without compromising the overall ranker
effectiveness and without needing to retrain the global ranker from scratch. A
key challenge is how to measure whether the model has unlearned the
contributions from the client $c^*$ that has requested removal. For this, we
instruct $c^*$ to perform a poisoning attack (add noise to this client updates)
and then we measure whether the impact of the attack is lessened when the
unlearning process has taken place. Through experiments on four datasets, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the unlearning strategy under
different combinations of parameter settings.

traditional collection and generation methods, including the constrained range
of action classes, absence of multi-viewpoint recordings, limited diversity,
poor video quality, and labor-intensive manually collection. To address these
challenges, we introduce GTAutoAct, a innovative dataset generation framework
leveraging game engine technology to facilitate advancements in action
recognition. GTAutoAct excels in automatically creating large-scale,
well-annotated datasets with extensive action classes and superior video
quality. Our framework's distinctive contributions encompass: (1) it
innovatively transforms readily available coordinate-based 3D human motion into
rotation-orientated representation with enhanced suitability in multiple
viewpoints; (2) it employs dynamic segmentation and interpolation of rotation
sequences to create smooth and realistic animations of action; (3) it offers
extensively customizable animation scenes; (4) it implements an autonomous
video capture and processing pipeline, featuring a randomly navigating camera,
with auto-trimming and labeling functionalities. Experimental results
underscore the framework's robustness and highlights its potential to
significantly improve action recognition model training.

<p class="mathjax">This paper quantifies an error source that limits the accuracy of lidar scan
matching, particularly for voxel-based methods. Lidar scan matching, which is
used in dead reckoning (also known as lidar odometry) and mapping, computes the
rotation and translation that best align a pair of point clouds. Perspective
errors occur when a scene is viewed from different angles, with different
surfaces becoming visible or occluded from each viewpoint. To explain
perspective anomalies observed in data, this paper models perspective errors
for two objects representative of urban landscapes: a cylindrical column and a
dual-wall corner. For each object, we provide an analytical model of the
perspective error for voxel-based lidar scan matching. We then analyze how
perspective errors accumulate as a lidar-equipped vehicle moves past these
objects.

<p class="mathjax">In Mediterranean countries of Southern Europe, the climatic conditions are
usually favourable to cultivate greenhouse vegetables but not always for
workers. The aim of this study was to design a network of weather stations
capable of gathering data of environmental parameters related to the wellbeing
of workers in greenhouses in south-eastern Spain. The unevenness of the thermal
environment was studied both vertically as well as horizontally following
guideline ISO 7726. The results indicate that the greenhouse should be
considered a heterogeneous environment, implying that, for an evaluation of the
environmental conditions related to thermal stress of the workers inside the
greenhouse, measurements should be taken at different points within the
greenhouse at three heights (ankle, abdomen, and head).

Markov Processes (PDifMPs), particularly when the explicit flow maps are
unavailable. Our approach is based on the thinning method for modelling the
jump mechanism and combines the Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate the
underlying flow dynamics. For the proposed approximation schemes, we study both
the mean-square and weak convergence. Weak convergence of the algorithms is
established by a martingale problem formulation. Moreover, we employ these
results to simulate the migration patterns exhibited by moving glioma cells at
the microscopic level. Further, we develop and implement a splitting method for
this PDifMP model and employ both the Thinned Euler-Maruyama and the splitting
scheme in our simulation example, allowing us to compare both methods.

normal random vectors $\mathsf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and
$\mathsf{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are correlated or not. This is formulated as a
hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, these vectors are
statistically independent, while under the alternative, $\mathsf{X}$ and a
randomly and uniformly permuted version of $\mathsf{Y}$, are correlated with
correlation $\rho$. We analyze the thresholds at which optimal testing is
information-theoretically impossible and possible, as a function of $n$ and
$\rho$. To derive our information-theoretic lower bounds, we develop a novel
technique for evaluating the second moment of the likelihood ratio using an
orthogonal polynomials expansion, which among other things, reveals a
surprising connection to integer partition functions. We also study a
multi-dimensional generalization of the above setting, where rather than two
vectors we observe two databases/matrices, and furthermore allow for partial

<p class="mathjax">Thin-plate spline (TPS) is a principal warp that allows for representing
elastic, nonlinear transformation with control point motions. With the increase
of control points, the warp becomes increasingly flexible but usually
encounters a bottleneck caused by undesired issues, e.g., content distortion.
In this paper, we explore generic applications of TPS in single-image-based
warping tasks, such as rotation correction, rectangling, and portrait
correction. To break this bottleneck, we propose the coupled thin-plate spline
model (CoupledTPS), which iteratively couples multiple TPS with limited control
points into a more flexible and powerful transformation. Concretely, we first
design an iterative search to predict new control points according to the
current latent condition. Then, we present the warping flow as a bridge for the
coupling of different TPS transformations, effectively eliminating
interpolation errors caused by multiple warps. Besides, in light of the
laborious annotation cost, we develop a semi-supervised learning scheme to
improve warping quality by exploiting unlabeled data. It is formulated through
dual transformation between the searched control points of unlabeled data and
its graphic augmentation, yielding an implicit correction consistency
constraint. Finally, we collect massive unlabeled data to exhibit the benefit
of our semi-supervised scheme in rotation correction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and universality of CoupledTPS over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions for rotation correction and beyond. The code
and data will be available at https://github.com/nie-lang/CoupledTPS.

<p class="mathjax">The main objective of an Information Retrieval system is to provide a user
with the most relevant documents to the user's query. To do this, modern IR
systems typically deploy a re-ranking pipeline in which a set of documents is
retrieved by a lightweight first-stage retrieval process and then re-ranked by
a more effective but expensive model. However, the success of a re-ranking
pipeline is heavily dependent on the performance of the first stage retrieval,
since new documents are not usually identified during the re-ranking stage.
Moreover, this can impact the amount of exposure that a particular group of
documents, such as documents from a particular demographic group, can receive
in the final ranking. For example, the fair allocation of exposure becomes more
challenging or impossible if the first stage retrieval returns too few
documents from certain groups, since the number of group documents in the
ranking affects the exposure more than the documents' positions. With this in
mind, it is beneficial to predict the amount of exposure that a group of
documents is likely to receive in the results of the first stage retrieval
process, in order to ensure that there are a sufficient number of documents
included from each of the groups. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of
query exposure prediction (QEP). Specifically, we propose the first approach
for predicting the distribution of exposure that groups of documents will
receive for a given query. Our new approach, called GEP, uses lexical
information from individual groups of documents to estimate the exposure the
groups will receive in a ranking. Our experiments on the TREC 2021 and 2022
Fair Ranking Track test collections show that our proposed GEP approach results
in exposure predictions that are up to 40 % more accurate than the predictions
of adapted existing query performance prediction and resource allocation
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by the octopus and other animals living in water, soft robots should
naturally lend themselves to underwater operations, as supported by encouraging
validations in deep water scenarios. This work deals with equipping soft arms
with the intelligence necessary to move precisely in wave-dominated
environments, such as shallow waters where marine renewable devices are
located. This scenario is substantially more challenging than calm deep water
since, at low operational depths, hydrodynamic wave disturbances can represent
a significant impediment. We propose a control strategy based on Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control that can account for wave disturbances explicitly,
optimising control actions by considering an estimate of oncoming hydrodynamic
loads. The proposed strategy is validated through a set of tasks covering
set-point regulation, trajectory tracking and mechanical failure compensation,
all under a broad range of varying significant wave heights and peak spectral
periods. The proposed control methodology displays positional error reductions
as large as 84% with respect to a baseline controller, proving the
effectiveness of the method. These initial findings present a first step in the
development and deployment of soft manipulators for performing tasks in
hazardous water environments.

<p class="mathjax">Integrating Brain-Machine Interfaces into non-clinical applications like
robot motion control remains difficult - despite remarkable advancements in
clinical settings. Specifically, EEG-based motor imagery systems are still
error-prone, posing safety risks when rigid robots operate near humans. This
work presents an alternative pathway towards safe and effective operation by
combining wearable EEG with physically embodied safety in soft robots. We
introduce and test a pipeline that allows a user to move a soft robot's end
effector in real time via brain waves that are measured by as few as three EEG
channels. A robust motor imagery algorithm interprets the user's intentions to
move the position of a virtual attractor to which the end effector is
attracted, thanks to a new Cartesian impedance controller. We specifically
focus here on planar soft robot-based architected metamaterials, which require
the development of a novel control architecture to deal with the peculiar
nonlinearities - e.g., non-affinity in control. We preliminarily but
quantitatively evaluate the approach on the task of setpoint regulation. We
observe that the user reaches the proximity of the setpoint in 66% of steps and
that for successful steps, the average response time is 21.5s. We also
demonstrate the execution of simple real-world tasks involving interaction with
the environment, which would be extremely hard to perform if it were not for
the robot's softness.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient implementation of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
transceivers is essential for the next-generation wireless networks. To reduce
the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this
paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision
arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower
bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using
maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems
using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then,
considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of
zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal
equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum
rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon
insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision
architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to
finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and
computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds
and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to
the conventional structure.

<p class="mathjax">In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable
capabilities. However, updating their knowledge poses challenges, potentially
leading to inaccuracies when confronted with unfamiliar queries. While
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs has been explored, existing approaches
treat LLMs as primary decision-makers, imposing high demands on their
capabilities. This is particularly unsuitable for LLMs with lower computational
costs and relatively poorer performance. In this paper, we introduce a
Clue-Guided Path Exploration framework (CGPE) that efficiently merges a
knowledge base with an LLM, placing less stringent requirements on the model's
capabilities. Inspired by the method humans use to manually retrieve knowledge,
CGPE employs information from the question as clues to systematically explore
the required knowledge path within the knowledge base. Experiments on
open-source datasets reveal that CGPE outperforms previous methods and is
highly applicable to LLMs with fewer parameters. In some instances, even
ChatGLM3, with its 6 billion parameters, can rival the performance of GPT-4.
Furthermore, the results indicate a minimal invocation frequency of CGPE on
LLMs, suggesting reduced computational overhead. For organizations and
individuals facing constraints in computational resources, our research offers
significant practical value.

<p class="mathjax">Machine-learning methods are gradually being adopted in a great variety of
social, economic, and scientific contexts, yet they are notorious for
struggling with exact mathematics. A typical example is computer algebra, which
includes tasks like simplifying mathematical terms, calculating formal
derivatives, or finding exact solutions of algebraic equations. Traditional
software packages for these purposes are commonly based on a huge database of
rules for how a specific operation (e.g., differentiation) transforms a certain
term (e.g., sine function) into another one (e.g., cosine function). Thus far,
these rules have usually needed to be discovered and subsequently programmed by
humans. Focusing on the paradigmatic example of solving linear equations in
symbolic form, we demonstrate how the process of finding elementary
transformation rules and step-by-step solutions can be automated using
reinforcement learning with deep neural networks.

helps users discover interesting places. There is a trend to move from the
cloud-based model to on-device recommendations for privacy protection and
reduced server reliance. Due to the scarcity of local user-item interactions on
individual devices, solely relying on local instances is not adequate.
Collaborative Learning (CL) emerges to promote model sharing among users, where
reference data is an intermediary that allows users to exchange their soft
decisions without directly sharing their private data or parameters, ensuring
privacy and benefiting from collaboration. However, existing CL-based
recommendations typically use a single reference for all users. Reference data
valuable for one user might be harmful to another, given diverse user
preferences. Users may not offer meaningful soft decisions on items outside
their interest scope. Consequently, using the same reference data for all
collaborations can impede knowledge exchange and lead to sub-optimal
performance. To address this gap, we introduce the Decentralized Collaborative
Learning with Adaptive Reference Data (DARD) framework, which crafts adaptive
reference data for effective user collaboration. It first generates a
desensitized public reference data pool with transformation and probability
data generation methods. For each user, the selection of adaptive reference
data is executed in parallel by training loss tracking and influence function.
Local models are trained with individual private data and collaboratively with
the geographical and semantic neighbors. During the collaboration between two
users, they exchange soft decisions based on a combined set of their adaptive
reference data. Our evaluations across two real-world datasets highlight DARD's
superiority in recommendation performance and addressing the scarcity of
available reference data.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, large offshore wind power plants have been installed far from the
shore, using long HVAC three-core armored cables to export power. Its high
capacitance may contribute to the appearance of unwanted phenomena, such as
overvoltages or resonances at low frequencies. To adequately assess these
problems, detailed and reliable cable models are required to develop
time-domain/frequency-domain analyses on this type of cables. This paper
presents, for the first time in the literature, an assessment on the
performance of 3D finite element method-based (3D-FEM) models for developing
frequency-domain analyses on three-core armored cables, confronting simulation
results with experimental measurements found in the literature for three real
cables. To this aim, a simplified ultra-shortened 3D-FEM model is proposed to
reduce the simulation time during frequency sweeps, through which relevant
aspects never analyzed before with frequency-domain 3D-FEM simulations are
addressed, such as total losses, induced sheath current, magnetic field around
the power cable, positive and zero sequence harmonic impedances, as well as
resonant frequencies. Also, a time-domain example derived from the
frequency-domain analysis is provided. Remarkable results are obtained when
comparing computed values and measurements, presenting the simplified
ultra-shortened 3DFEM model as a valuable tool for the frequency-domain
analysis of these cables.

<p class="mathjax">In the rapidly advancing field of multi-agent systems, ensuring robustness in
unfamiliar and adversarial settings is crucial. Notwithstanding their
outstanding performance in familiar environments, these systems often falter in
new situations due to overfitting during the training phase. This is especially
pronounced in settings where both cooperative and competitive behaviours are
present, encapsulating a dual nature of overfitting and generalisation
challenges. To address this issue, we present Multi-Agent Diagnostics for
Robustness via Illuminated Diversity (MADRID), a novel approach for generating
diverse adversarial scenarios that expose strategic vulnerabilities in
pre-trained multi-agent policies. Leveraging the concepts from open-ended
learning, MADRID navigates the vast space of adversarial settings, employing a
target policy's regret to gauge the vulnerabilities of these settings. We
evaluate the effectiveness of MADRID on the 11vs11 version of Google Research
Football, one of the most complex environments for multi-agent reinforcement
learning. Specifically, we employ MADRID for generating a diverse array of
adversarial settings for TiZero, the state-of-the-art approach which "masters"
the game through 45 days of training on a large-scale distributed
infrastructure. We expose key shortcomings in TiZero's tactical
decision-making, underlining the crucial importance of rigorous evaluation in
multi-agent systems.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent robot is the ultimate goal in the robotics field. Existing works
leverage learning-based or optimization-based methods to accomplish
human-defined tasks. However, the challenge of enabling robots to explore
various environments autonomously remains unresolved. In this work, we propose
a framework named GExp, which enables robots to explore and learn autonomously
without human intervention. To achieve this goal, we devise modules including
self-exploration, knowledge-base-building, and close-loop feedback based on
foundation models. Inspired by the way that infants interact with the world,
GExp encourages robots to understand and explore the environment with a series
of self-generated tasks. During the process of exploration, the robot will
acquire skills from beneficial experiences that are useful in the future. GExp
provides robots with the ability to solve complex tasks through
self-exploration. GExp work is independent of prior interactive knowledge and
human intervention, allowing it to adapt directly to different scenarios,
unlike previous studies that provided in-context examples as few-shot learning.
In addition, we propose a workflow of deploying the real-world robot system
with self-learned skills as an embodied assistant.

<p class="mathjax">Spoken Question Answering (SQA) is essential for machines to reply to user's
question by finding the answer span within a given spoken passage. SQA has been
previously achieved without ASR to avoid recognition errors and
Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. However, the real-world problem of
Open-domain SQA (openSQA), in which the machine needs to first retrieve
passages that possibly contain the answer from a spoken archive in addition,
was never considered. This paper proposes the first known end-to-end framework,
Speech Dense Passage Retriever (SpeechDPR), for the retrieval component of the
openSQA problem. SpeechDPR learns a sentence-level semantic representation by
distilling knowledge from the cascading model of unsupervised ASR (UASR) and
text dense retriever (TDR). No manually transcribed speech data is needed.
Initial experiments showed performance comparable to the cascading model of
UASR and TDR, and significantly better when UASR was poor, verifying this
approach is more robust to speech recognition errors.

<p class="mathjax">The mismatching phenomenon is one of the main issues in photovoltaic (PV)
applications. It could reduce the generated power of a string when a PV panel
has different performances from the other PV panels connected to the same
string. Distributed Maximum Power Point Tracking (DMPPT) architectures are one
of the most promising solutions to overcome the drawbacks associated with
mismatching phenomena in PV applications. In this kind of architectures, a
DC-DC module integrated converter (MIC) manages each PV panel, isolating it
from the rest of the PV panels, for harvesting the maximum available power from
the Sun. Due to the high number of DCDC converters used in a grid-tied PV
installation, the most desired MIC requirements are high efficiency, low cost
and the capability of voltage step-up and step-down. This paper proposes the
Buck-Boost Modified Forward (BBMSF) converter as a good candidate to be applied
in DMPPT architectures. A complete analysis of the BBMSF converter is carried
out, including the steady-state analysis as well as the small signal analysis
in continuous conduction mode. The main advantages of the BBMSF converter are
its step-up and step-down voltage transfer function; a higher simplicity, since
it only includes a single controlled switch; the soft switching characteristics
in all the diodes and MOSFET, reaching in some cases ZVS and ZCS, and yielding
high efficiencies; the use of an autotransformer, with better performances than
a typical Forward transformer; and the good dynamic performance, like the
Forward converter ones. The theoretical analyses are validated through the
experimental results in a 225 W BBMSF prototype designed and built under the
requirements of a 100 kW grid-tied PV installation, achieving an efficiency up
to 93.6%.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) is a rapidly evolving field, where
significant progress, particularly in image-text pairing, has been made through
advanced representation learning and cross-modality alignment research.
However, current benchmarks for evaluating MMIR performance in image-text
pairing within the scientific domain show a notable gap, where chart and table
images described in scholarly language usually do not play a significant role.
To bridge this gap, we develop a specialised scientific MMIR (SciMMIR)
benchmark by leveraging open-access paper collections to extract data relevant
to the scientific domain. This benchmark comprises 530K meticulously curated
image-text pairs, extracted from figures and tables with detailed captions in
scientific documents. We further annotate the image-text pairs with two-level
subset-subcategory hierarchy annotations to facilitate a more comprehensive
evaluation of the baselines. We conducted zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations
on prominent multi-modal image-captioning and visual language models, such as
CLIP and BLIP. Our analysis offers critical insights for MMIR in the scientific
domain, including the impact of pre-training and fine-tuning settings and the
influence of the visual and textual encoders. All our data and checkpoints are
publicly available at https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/SciMMIR.

<p class="mathjax">Many studies explore how people 'come into' misinformation exposure. But much
less is known about how people 'come out of' misinformation exposure. Do people
organically sever ties to misinformation spreaders? And what predicts doing so?
Over six months, we tracked the frequency and predictors of ~1M followers
unfollowing ~5K health misinformation spreaders on Twitter. We found that
misinformation ties are persistent. Monthly unfollowing rates are just 0.52%.
Users are also 31% more likely to unfollow non-misinformation spreaders than
they are to unfollow misinformation spreaders. Although generally infrequent,
the factors most associated with unfollowing misinformation spreaders are (1)
redundancy and (2) ideology. First, users initially following many spreaders,
or who follow spreaders that tweet often, are most likely to unfollow later.
Second, liberals are more likely to unfollow than conservatives. Overall, we
observe strong persistence of misinformation ties. The fact that users rarely
unfollow misinformation spreaders suggests a need for external nudges and the
importance of preventing exposure from arising in the first place.

<p class="mathjax">Exposure to large language model output is rapidly increasing. How will
seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+
participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were
from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own
idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high
exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic
experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition
are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition
-- mimics the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are
built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having
LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI
exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase
the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made
ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also
found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an
idea was from AI, and that participants were more likely to knowingly adopt AI
ideas when the task was difficult. Our findings suggest that introducing AI
ideas into society may increase collective diversity but not individual
creativity.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the scalar anisotropic wave equation. Recently a convergence
analysis for radial perfectly matched layers (PML) in the frequency domain was
reported and in the present article we continue this approach into the time
domain. First we explain why there is a good hope that radial complex scalings
can overcome the instabilities of PML methods caused by anisotropic materials.
Next we discuss some sensitive details, which seem like a paradox at the first
glance: if the absorbing layer and the inhomogeneities are sufficiently
separated, then the solution is indeed stable. However, for more general data
the problem becomes unstable. In numerical computations we observe
instabilities regardless of the position of the inhomogeneities, although the
instabilities arise only for fine enough discretizations. As a remedy we
propose a complex frequency shifted scaling and discretizations by Hardy space
infinite elements or truncation-free PMLs. We show numerical experiments which
confirm the stability and convergence of these methods.

presented. Numerical experiments have been carried out for a number of problems
showing that this method has a significantly higher convergence rate and
accuracy than the vanilla physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and even
SPINN based on a system of partial differential equations (PDEs). In addition,
using the SPINN in the framework of DEM approach it is possible to solve
problems of the linear theory of elasticity on complex geometries, which is
unachievable with the help of PINNs in frames of partial differential
equations. Considered problems are very close to the industrial problems in
terms of geometry, loading, and material parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Data plane verification (DPV) analyzes routing tables and detects routing
abnormalities and policy violations during network operation and planning.
Thus, it has become an important tool to harden the networking infrastructure
and the computing systems building on top. Substantial advancements have been
made in the last decade and state-of-the-art DPV systems can achieve sub-us
verification for an update of a single forwarding rule.
<br />In this paper, we introduce fast inverse model transformation (FIMT), the
first theoretical framework to systematically model and analyze centralized DPV
systems. FIMT reveals the algebraic structure in the model update process, a
key step in fast DPV systems. Thus, it can systematically analyze the
correctness of several DPV systems, using algebraic properties. The theory also
guides the design and implementation of NeoFlash, a refactored version of Flash
with new optimization techniques. Evaluations show that NeoFlash outperforms
existing state-of-the-art centralized DPV systems in various datasets and
reveal insights to key techniques towards fast DPV.

<p class="mathjax">University rankings, despite facing criticism, continue to maintain their
popularity. In the 2023 Scopus Ranking of Ukrainian Universities, certain
institutions stood out due to their high h-index, despite modest publication
and citation numbers. This phenomenon can be attributed to influential research
topics or involvement in international collaborative research. However, these
results may also be due to the authors' own efforts to increase the number of
citations of their publications in order to improve their h-index. To
investigate this, the publications from the top 30 universities in the ranking
were analysed, revealing humpback rank-citation curves for two universities.
These humpbacks indicate unusual trends in the citation data, especially
considering the high percentage of self-citations and FWCI of analysed papers.
While quantitative analysis has limitations, the combination of humped
rank-citation curves, self-citations, FWCI, and previous research findings
raises concerns about the possible causes of these anomalies in the citation
data of the analysed universities. The method presented in this paper can aid
ranking compilers and citation databases managers in identifying potential
instances of citation data anomalies, emphasizing the importance of expert
assessment for accurate conclusions.

and application of an autonomous, self-driving compost turner. The aim is to
overcome challenges in the composting industry, such as adverse working
conditions, by automating the composting process. The preprint provides a
comprehensive overview of the overall concept of the self-driving compost
turner, including the hardware architecture with sensors, navigation module and
control module. In addition, the methodical development of the architecture of
concepts, models and their subsequent software integration in ROS using
model-based systems engineering is described. The validation and verification
of the overall system is carried out in an industrial environment using three
scenarios. The capabilities of the compost turner are demonstrated by
autonomously following predefined trajectories in the composting plant and
performing the required composting tasks. The results show that the autonomous
compost turner is capable of performing the required activities. In addition,
the compost turner has intelligent processing capabilities for compost data as
well as its transmission, visualization and storage in a cloud server. It is
important to note that this work is a preprint that represents the current
state of research. The authors aim to publish the full paper in a peer-reviewed

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose Neumann Series Neural Operator (NSNO) to learn the
solution operator of Helmholtz equation from inhomogeneity coefficients and
source terms to solutions. Helmholtz equation is a crucial partial differential
equation (PDE) with applications in various scientific and engineering fields.
However, efficient solver of Helmholtz equation is still a big challenge
especially in the case of high wavenumber. Recently, deep learning has shown
great potential in solving PDEs especially in learning solution operators.
Inspired by Neumann series in Helmholtz equation, we design a novel network
architecture in which U-Net is embedded inside to capture the multiscale
feature. Extensive experiments show that the proposed NSNO significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art FNO with at least 60\% lower relative
$L^2$-error, especially in the large wavenumber case, and has 50\% lower
computational cost and less data requirement. Moreover, NSNO can be used as the
surrogate model in inverse scattering problems. Numerical tests show that NSNO
is able to give comparable results with traditional finite difference forward
solver while the computational cost is reduced tremendously.

harmonic balance based adjoint sensitivity analysis. TFHA provides
sensitivities of quantities of interest from time-periodic problems w.r.t. many

The TFHA shows advantages in applications where the harmonic balance based

<p class="mathjax">Synthesizing performing guitar sound is a highly challenging task due to the
polyphony and high variability in expression. Recently, deep generative models
have shown promising results in synthesizing expressive polyphonic instrument
sounds from music scores, often using a generic MIDI input. In this work, we
propose an expressive acoustic guitar sound synthesis model with a customized
input representation to the instrument, which we call guitarroll. We implement
the proposed approach using diffusion-based outpainting which can generate
audio with long-term consistency. To overcome the lack of MIDI/audio-paired
datasets, we used not only an existing guitar dataset but also collected data
from a high quality sample-based guitar synthesizer. Through quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, we show that our proposed model has higher audio
quality than the baseline model and generates more realistic timbre sounds than
the previous leading work.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot image classification has emerged as a key challenge in the field of
computer vision, highlighting the capability to rapidly adapt to new tasks with
minimal labeled data. Existing methods predominantly rely on image-level
features or local descriptors, often overlooking the holistic context
surrounding these descriptors. In this work, we introduce a novel approach
termed "Local Descriptor with Contextual Augmentation (LDCA)". Specifically,
this method bridges the gap between local and global understanding uniquely by
leveraging an adaptive global contextual enhancement module. This module
incorporates a visual transformer, endowing local descriptors with contextual
awareness capabilities, ranging from broad global perspectives to intricate
surrounding nuances. By doing so, LDCA transcends traditional descriptor-based
approaches, ensuring each local feature is interpreted within its larger visual
narrative. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of our method, showing
a maximal absolute improvement of 20\% over the next-best on fine-grained
classification datasets, thus demonstrating significant advancements in
few-shot classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting if a graph contains a $k$-Clique is one of the most fundamental
problems in computer science. The asymptotically fastest algorithm runs in time
$O(n^{\omega k/3})$, where $\omega$ is the exponent of Boolean matrix
multiplication. To date, this is the only technique capable of beating the
trivial $O(n^k)$ bound by a polynomial factor. Due to this technique's various
limitations, much effort has gone into designing "combinatorial" algorithms
that improve over exhaustive search via other techniques.
<br />The first contribution of this work is a faster combinatorial algorithm for
$k$-Clique, improving Vassilevska's bound of $O(n^{k}/\log^{k-1}{n})$ by two
log factors. Technically, our main result is a new reduction from $k$-Clique to
Triangle detection that exploits the same divide-and-conquer at the core of
recent combinatorial algorithms by Chan (SODA'15) and Yu (ICALP'15).
<br />Our second contribution is exploiting combinatorial techniques to improve the
state-of-the-art (even of non-combinatorial algorithms) for generalizations of
the $k$-Clique problem. In particular, we give the first $o(n^k)$ algorithm for
$k$-clique in hypergraphs and an $O(n^3/\log^{2.25}{n} + t)$ algorithm for
listing $t$ triangles in a graph.

module for training the auto-encoder via masked image reconstruction, the PICD
module for employing two levels of contrastive learning, and the CLI module for
mutual interaction between the instance-level and cluster-level subspaces.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on six real-world image datasets,

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, particularly since the early 2020s, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have emerged as the most powerful AI tools in addressing a diverse range
of challenges, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving in
various domains. In the field of tamper detection, LLMs are capable of
identifying basic tampering activities.To assess the capabilities of LLMs in
more specialized domains, we have collected five different LLMs developed by
various companies: GPT-4, LLaMA, Bard, ERNIE Bot 4.0, and Tongyi Qianwen. This
diverse range of models allows for a comprehensive evaluation of their
performance in detecting sophisticated tampering instances.We devised two
domains of detection: AI-Generated Content (AIGC) detection and manipulation
detection. AIGC detection aims to test the ability to distinguish whether an
image is real or AI-generated. Manipulation detection, on the other hand,
focuses on identifying tampered images. According to our experiments, most LLMs
can identify composite pictures that are inconsistent with logic, and only more
powerful LLMs can distinguish logical, but visible signs of tampering to the
human eye. All of the LLMs can't identify carefully forged images and very
realistic images generated by AI. In the area of tamper detection, LLMs still
have a long way to go, particularly in reliably identifying highly
sophisticated forgeries and AI-generated images that closely mimic reality.

<p class="mathjax">Human motion stylization aims to revise the style of an input motion while
keeping its content unaltered. Unlike existing works that operate directly in
pose space, we leverage the latent space of pretrained autoencoders as a more
expressive and robust representation for motion extraction and infusion.
Building upon this, we present a novel generative model that produces diverse
stylization results of a single motion (latent) code. During training, a motion
code is decomposed into two coding components: a deterministic content code,
and a probabilistic style code adhering to a prior distribution; then a
generator massages the random combination of content and style codes to
reconstruct the corresponding motion codes. Our approach is versatile, allowing
the learning of probabilistic style space from either style labeled or
unlabeled motions, providing notable flexibility in stylization as well. In
inference, users can opt to stylize a motion using style cues from a reference
motion or a label. Even in the absence of explicit style input, our model
facilitates novel re-stylization by sampling from the unconditional style prior
distribution. Experimental results show that our proposed stylization models,
despite their lightweight design, outperform the state-of-the-arts in style
reeanactment, content preservation, and generalization across various
applications and settings. Project Page: https://yxmu.foo/GenMoStyle

retrievers in a resource constrained environment such as that of cheap cloud
instances or embedded systems (e.g., smartphones and smartwatches), where
memory and CPU are limited and GPUs are not present. For this, we propose a
transformer-based PRF method (TPRF), which has a much smaller memory footprint
and faster inference time compared to other deep language models that employ
PRF mechanisms, with a marginal effectiveness loss. TPRF learns how to
effectively combine the relevance feedback signals from dense passage
representations. Specifically, TPRF provides a mechanism for modelling
relationships and weights between the query and the relevance feedback signals.
The method is agnostic to the specific dense representation used and thus can
be generally applied to any dense retriever.

<p class="mathjax">Objective: To investigate GPT-3.5 in generating and coding medical documents
with ICD-10 codes for data augmentation on low-resources labels.
<br />Materials and Methods: Employing GPT-3.5 we generated and coded 9,606
discharge summaries based on lists of ICD-10 code descriptions of patients with
infrequent (generation) codes within the MIMIC-IV dataset. Combined with the
baseline training set, this formed an augmented training set. Neural coding
models were trained on baseline and augmented data and evaluated on a MIMIC-IV
test set. We report micro- and macro-F1 scores on the full codeset, generation
codes, and their families. Weak Hierarchical Confusion Matrices were employed
to determine within-family and outside-of-family coding errors in the latter
codesets. The coding performance of GPT-3.5 was evaluated both on prompt-guided
self-generated data and real MIMIC-IV data. Clinical professionals evaluated
the clinical acceptability of the generated documents.
<br />Results: Augmentation slightly hinders the overall performance of the models
but improves performance for the generation candidate codes and their families,
including one unseen in the baseline training data. Augmented models display
lower out-of-family error rates. GPT-3.5 can identify ICD-10 codes by the
prompted descriptions, but performs poorly on real data. Evaluators note the
correctness of generated concepts while suffering in variety, supporting
information, and narrative.
<br />Discussion and Conclusion: GPT-3.5 alone is unsuitable for ICD-10 coding.
Augmentation positively affects generation code families but mainly benefits
codes with existing examples. Augmentation reduces out-of-family errors.
Discharge summaries generated by GPT-3.5 state prompted concepts correctly but
lack variety, and authenticity in narratives. They are unsuitable for clinical
practice.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfake videos are becoming increasingly realistic, showing subtle tampering
traces on facial areasthat vary between frames. Consequently, many existing
Deepfake detection methods struggle to detect unknown domain Deepfake videos
while accurately locating the tampered region. To address thislimitation, we
propose Delocate, a novel Deepfake detection model that can both recognize
andlocalize unknown domain Deepfake videos. Ourmethod consists of two stages
named recoveringand localization. In the recovering stage, the modelrandomly
masks regions of interest (ROIs) and reconstructs real faces without tampering
traces, resulting in a relatively good recovery effect for realfaces and a poor
recovery effect for fake faces. Inthe localization stage, the output of the
recoveryphase and the forgery ground truth mask serve assupervision to guide
the forgery localization process. This process strategically emphasizes the
recovery phase of fake faces with poor recovery, facilitating the localization
of tampered regions. Ourextensive experiments on four widely used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that Delocate not onlyexcels in localizing tampered areas
but also enhances cross-domain detection performance.

<p class="mathjax">Chronic disease management and follow-up are vital for realizing sustained
patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Recent advancements in wearable
sensing technologies, particularly wrist-worn devices, offer promising
solutions for longitudinal patient follow-up by shifting from subjective,
intermittent self-reporting to objective, continuous monitoring. However,
collecting and analyzing wearable data presents unique challenges, such as data
entry errors, non-wear periods, missing wearable data, and wearable artifacts.
We therefore present an in-depth exploration of data analysis challenges tied
to wrist-worn wearables and ambulatory label acquisition, using two real-world
datasets (i.e., mBrain21 and ETRI lifelog2020). We introduce novel practical
countermeasures, including participant compliance visualizations,
interaction-triggered questionnaires to assess personal bias, and an optimized
wearable non-wear detection pipeline. Further, we propose a visual analytics
approach to validate processing pipelines using scalable tools such as tsflex
and Plotly-Resampler. Lastly, we investigate the impact of missing wearable
data on "window-of-interest" analysis methodologies. Prioritizing transparency
and reproducibility, we offer open access to our detailed code examples,
facilitating adaptation in future wearable research. In conclusion, our
contributions provide actionable approaches for wearable data collection and
analysis in chronic disease management.

<p class="mathjax">Benefiting from effective speech modeling, current Speech Large Language
Models (SLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in in-context speech
generation and efficient generalization to unseen speakers. However, the
prevailing information modeling process is encumbered by certain redundancies,
leading to inefficiencies in speech generation. We propose Chain-of-Information
Generation (CoIG), a method for decoupling semantic and perceptual information
in large-scale speech generation. Building on this, we develop SpeechGPT-Gen,
an 8-billion-parameter SLLM efficient in semantic and perceptual information
modeling. It comprises an autoregressive model based on LLM for semantic
information modeling and a non-autoregressive model employing flow matching for
perceptual information modeling. Additionally, we introduce the novel approach
of infusing semantic information into the prior distribution to enhance the
efficiency of flow matching. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
SpeechGPT-Gen markedly excels in zero-shot text-to-speech, zero-shot voice
conversion, and speech-to-speech dialogue, underscoring CoIG's remarkable
proficiency in capturing and modeling speech's semantic and perceptual
dimensions. Code and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">Recently, optimization on the Riemannian manifold has provided new insights
to the optimization community. In this regard, the manifold taken as the
probability measure metric space equipped with the second-order Wasserstein
distance is of particular interest, since optimization on it can be linked to
practical sampling processes. In general, the oracle (continuous) optimization
method on Wasserstein space is Riemannian gradient flow (i.e., Langevin
dynamics when minimizing KL divergence). In this paper, we aim to enrich the
continuous optimization methods in the Wasserstein space by extending the
gradient flow into the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) flow and stochastic
variance reduction gradient (SVRG) flow. The two flows on Euclidean space are
standard stochastic optimization methods, while their Riemannian counterparts
are not explored yet. By leveraging the structures in Wasserstein space, we
construct a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to approximate the discrete
dynamics of desired stochastic methods in the corresponded random vector space.
Then, the flows of probability measures are naturally obtained by applying
Fokker-Planck equation to such SDE. Furthermore, the convergence rates of the
proposed Riemannian stochastic flows are proven, and they match the results in
Euclidean space.

<p class="mathjax">Gait recognition is a promising biometric method that aims to identify
pedestrians from their unique walking patterns. Silhouette modality, renowned
for its easy acquisition, simple structure, sparse representation, and
convenient modeling, has been widely employed in controlled in-the-lab
research. However, as gait recognition rapidly advances from in-the-lab to
in-the-wild scenarios, various conditions raise significant challenges for
silhouette modality, including 1) unidentifiable low-quality silhouettes
(abnormal segmentation, severe occlusion, or even non-human shape), and 2)
identifiable but challenging silhouettes (background noise, non-standard
posture, slight occlusion). To address these challenges, we revisit gait
recognition pipeline and approach gait recognition from a quality perspective,
namely QAGait. Specifically, we propose a series of cost-effective quality
assessment strategies, including Maxmial Connect Area and Template Match to
eliminate background noises and unidentifiable silhouettes, Alignment strategy
to handle non-standard postures. We also propose two quality-aware loss
functions to integrate silhouette quality into optimization within the
embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate our QAGait can guarantee
both gait reliability and performance enhancement. Furthermore, our quality
assessment strategies can seamlessly integrate with existing gait datasets,
showcasing our superiority. Code is available at
https://github.com/wzb-bupt/QAGait.

<p class="mathjax">The flow game with public arcs is a cooperative revenue game derived from a
flow network. In this game, each player possesses an arc, while certain arcs,
known as public arcs, are not owned by any specific player and are accessible
to any coalition. The aim of this game is to maximize the flow that can be
routed in the network through strategic coalition formation. By exploring its
connection to the maximum partially disjoint path problem, we investigate the
approximate core and nucleon of the flow game with public arcs. The approximate
core is an extension of the core that allows for some deviation in group
rationality, while the nucleon is a multiplicative analogue of the nucleolus.
In this paper, we provide two complete characterizations for the optimal
approximate core and show that the nucleon can be computed in polynomial time.

significant improvements of existing ones in numerous different application
domains. A major trait of upcoming CPS is an increasing degree of automation up
to the point of autonomy, as there is a huge potential for economic success as
well as for ecologic and societal improvements. However, to unlock the full
potential of such (cooperative and automated) CPS, we first need to overcome
several significant engineering challenges, where safety assurance is a
particularly important one. Unfortunately, established safety assurance methods
and standards do not live up to this task, as they have been designed with
closed and less complex systems in mind. This paper structures safety assurance

<p class="mathjax">In contrast to conventional robots, accurately modeling the kinematics and
statics of continuum robots is challenging due to partially unknown material
properties, parasitic effects, or unknown forces acting on the continuous body.
Consequentially, state estimation approaches that utilize additional sensor
information to predict the shape of continuum robots have garnered significant
interest. This paper presents a novel approach to state estimation for systems
with multiple coupled continuum robots, which allows estimating the shape and
strain variables of multiple continuum robots in an arbitrary coupled topology.
Simulations and experiments demonstrate the capabilities and versatility of the
proposed method, while achieving accurate and continuous estimates for the
state of such systems, resulting in average end-effector errors of 3.3 mm and
5.02{\deg} depending on the sensor setup. It is further shown, that the
approach offers fast computation times of below 10 ms, enabling its utilization
in quasi-static real-time scenarios with average update rates of 100-200 Hz. An
open-source C++ implementation of the proposed state estimation method is made
publicly available to the community.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, interpretable machine learning has re-explored concept bottleneck
models (CBM), comprising step-by-step prediction of the high-level concepts
from the raw features and the target variable from the predicted concepts. A
compelling advantage of this model class is the user's ability to intervene on
the predicted concept values, affecting the model's downstream output. In this
work, we introduce a method to perform such concept-based interventions on
already-trained neural networks, which are not interpretable by design, given
an annotated validation set. Furthermore, we formalise the model's
intervenability as a measure of the effectiveness of concept-based
interventions and leverage this definition to fine-tune black-box models.
Empirically, we explore the intervenability of black-box classifiers on
synthetic tabular and natural image benchmarks. We demonstrate that fine-tuning
improves intervention effectiveness and often yields better-calibrated
predictions. To showcase the practical utility of the proposed techniques, we
apply them to deep chest X-ray classifiers and show that fine-tuned black boxes
can be as intervenable and more performant than CBMs.

Language Models (LLMs) in information extraction tasks like Named Entity
Recognition (NER), using prompts or instructions, still falls short of
supervised baselines. The reason for this performance gap can be attributed to
the fundamental disparity between NER and LLMs. NER is inherently a sequence
labeling task, where the model must assign entity-type labels to individual
tokens within a sentence. In contrast, LLMs are designed as a text generation
task. This distinction between semantic labeling and text generation leads to
subpar performance. In this paper, we transform the NER task into a
text-generation task that can be readily adapted by LLMs. This involves
enhancing source sentences with task-specific instructions and answer choices,
allowing for the identification of entities and their types within natural
language. We harness the strength of LLMs by integrating supervised learning
within them. The goal of this combined strategy is to boost the performance of
LLMs in extraction tasks like NER while simultaneously addressing hallucination
issues often observed in LLM-generated content. A novel corpus Contract NER
comprising seven frequently observed contract categories, encompassing named
entities associated with 18 distinct legal entity types is released along with
our baseline models. Our models and dataset are available to the community for
future research * .

<p class="mathjax">Grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) installations with Distributed Maximum Power
Point Tracking (DMPPT) architectures include a DC-DC Module Integrated
Converter (MIC) for managing each PV panel, isolating it from the others,
reducing the mismatching effect and maximizing the harvested power. In this
paper, the Autotransformer Forward converter with type-Zeta resonant reset
(AFZ) is proposed as a DMPPT architecture MIC candidate. The main
characteristics of the AFZ converter are the high versatility due to its
voltage step-up and step-down capability; the use of an optimized
autotransformer with only two windings, reducing the complexity and power
losses of this component; the good dynamic performances, like the Forward
converter ones; the low number of components and the simplicity and high
feasibility associated to the use of just one active switch. Besides, soft
switching transitions are achieved thanks to the autotransformer type-Zeta
resonant reset. The steady-state theoretical analysis, considering the effect
of the autotransformer leakage inductance, is presented. The converter is also
studied in the frequency domain, obtaining the small-signal transfer functions.
A design procedure based on the requirements of a 100 kW grid-tied photovoltaic
installation is described, yielding in a 225 W prototype with efficiencies up
to 95.6 %. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">In the intricate acoustic landscapes where speech intelligibility is
challenged by noise and reverberation, multichannel speech enhancement emerges
as a promising solution for individuals with hearing loss. Such algorithms are
commonly evaluated at the utterance level. However, this approach overlooks the
granular acoustic nuances revealed by phoneme-specific analysis, potentially
obscuring key insights into their performance. This paper presents an in-depth
phoneme-scale evaluation of 3 state-of-the-art multichannel speech enhancement
algorithms. These algorithms -- FasNet, MVDR, and Tango -- are extensively
evaluated across different noise conditions and spatial setups, employing
realistic acoustic simulations with measured room impulse responses, and
leveraging diversity offered by multiple microphones in a binaural hearing
setup. The study emphasizes the fine-grained phoneme-level analysis, revealing
that while some phonemes like plosives are heavily impacted by environmental
acoustics and challenging to deal with by the algorithms, others like nasals
and sibilants see substantial improvements after enhancement. These
investigations demonstrate important improvements in phoneme clarity in noisy
conditions, with insights that could drive the development of more personalized
and phoneme-aware hearing aid technologies.

<p class="mathjax">Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection
(UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each
other. In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other,
and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their
training framework significantly. Second, previous work usually adopts fixed
thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is
not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process. To
alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that
alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a
Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD. The OCC or WS models in our method can
be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to
upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields. For handling the
fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive
boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal
and abnormal data. We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically
finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The main objective of the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon
control problem is to regulate CAVs' position while ensuring stability and
accounting for vehicle dynamics. Although this problem has been studied in the
literature, existing research has some limitations. This paper presents two new
theoretical results that address these limitations: (i) the synthesis of
unrealistic high-gain control parameters due to the lack of a systematic way to
incorporate the lower and upper bounds on the control parameters, and (ii) the
performance sensitivity to the communication delay due to inaccurate Taylor
series approximation. To be more precise, taking advantage of the wellknown
Pade approximation, this paper proposes a constrained CAV platoon controller
synthesis that (i) systematically incorporates the lower and upper bounds on
the control parameters, and (ii) significantly improves the performance
sensitivity to the communication delay. The effectiveness of the presented
results is verified through conducting extensive numerical simulations. The
proposed controller effectively attenuates the stop-and-go disturbance -- a
single cycle of deceleration followed by acceleration -- amplification
throughout the mixed platoon (consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles).
Modern transportation systems will benefit from the proposed CAV controls in
terms of effective disturbance attenuation as it will potentially reduce
collisions.

<p class="mathjax">We present the PanAf20K dataset, the largest and most diverse open-access
annotated video dataset of great apes in their natural environment. It
comprises more than 7 million frames across ~20,000 camera trap videos of
chimpanzees and gorillas collected at 18 field sites in tropical Africa as part
of the Pan African Programme: The Cultured Chimpanzee. The footage is
accompanied by a rich set of annotations and benchmarks making it suitable for
training and testing a variety of challenging and ecologically important
computer vision tasks including ape detection and behaviour recognition.
Furthering AI analysis of camera trap information is critical given the
International Union for Conservation of Nature now lists all species in the
great ape family as either Endangered or Critically Endangered. We hope the
dataset can form a solid basis for engagement of the AI community to improve
performance, efficiency, and result interpretation in order to support
assessments of great ape presence, abundance, distribution, and behaviour and
thereby aid conservation efforts.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of deep generative models for
creating synthetic media, such as images and videos. While the practical
applications of these models in everyday tasks are enticing, it is crucial to
assess the inherent risks regarding their fairness. In this work, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for benchmarking the performance and fairness of
conditional generative models. We develop a set of
metrics$\unicode{x2013}$inspired by their supervised fairness
counterparts$\unicode{x2013}$to evaluate the models on their fairness and
diversity. Focusing on the specific application of image upsampling, we create
a benchmark covering a wide variety of modern upsampling methods. As part of
the benchmark, we introduce UnfairFace, a subset of FairFace that replicates
the racial distribution of common large-scale face datasets. Our empirical
study highlights the importance of using an unbiased training set and reveals
variations in how the algorithms respond to dataset imbalances. Alarmingly, we
find that none of the considered methods produces statistically fair and
diverse results.

<p class="mathjax">In railway applications, it is common to use an LC filter connected between
the catenary and the input port of the main converter of the auxiliary and
traction systems. In addition, in the auxiliary systems, there is a converter
operating as a battery charger, which requires a very low ripple in the output
current and output voltage, so a postfilter may be placed at the output port of
the converter. This article proposes a step-by-step methodology to extend the
injected-absorbed-current (IAC) method in order to obtain transfer functions
that consider the effects of the input filter, output postfilter, and some
feedforward compensations. The proposed methodology allows reusing the
characteristic coefficients of the DC-DC converter model derived from the
existing IAC method. One of the advantages of the proposed methodology is that
the transfer functions obtained in this article are valid for cases where both,
one or none of the filters, are implemented. Finally, for the experimental
validation of the proposed methodology, the phase-shifted full-bridge converter
was selected as a convenient example. Furthermore, the experimental
measurements have been performed on two prototypes.

<p class="mathjax">The utility of a learned neural representation depends on how well its
geometry supports performance in downstream tasks. This geometry depends on the
structure of the inputs, the structure of the target outputs, and the
architecture of the network. By studying the learning dynamics of networks with
one hidden layer, we discovered that the network's activation function has an
unexpectedly strong impact on the representational geometry: Tanh networks tend
to learn representations that reflect the structure of the target outputs,
while ReLU networks retain more information about the structure of the raw
inputs. This difference is consistently observed across a broad class of
parameterized tasks in which we modulated the degree of alignment between the
geometry of the task inputs and that of the task labels. We analyzed the
learning dynamics in weight space and show how the differences between the
networks with Tanh and ReLU nonlinearities arise from the asymmetric asymptotic
behavior of ReLU, which leads feature neurons to specialize for different
regions of input space. By contrast, feature neurons in Tanh networks tend to
inherit the task label structure. Consequently, when the target outputs are low
dimensional, Tanh networks generate neural representations that are more
disentangled than those obtained with a ReLU nonlinearity. Our findings shed
light on the interplay between input-output geometry, nonlinearity, and learned
representations in neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">The Transformer architecture has shown a remarkable ability in modeling
global relationships. However, it poses a significant computational challenge
when processing high-dimensional medical images. This hinders its development
and widespread adoption in this task. Mamba, as a State Space Model (SSM),
recently emerged as a notable manner for long-range dependencies in sequential
modeling, excelling in natural language processing filed with its remarkable
memory efficiency and computational speed. Inspired by its success, we
introduce SegMamba, a novel 3D medical image \textbf{Seg}mentation
\textbf{Mamba} model, designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies
within whole volume features at every scale. Our SegMamba, in contrast to
Transformer-based methods, excels in whole volume feature modeling from a state
space model standpoint, maintaining superior processing speed, even with volume
features at a resolution of {$64\times 64\times 64$}. Comprehensive experiments
on the BraTS2023 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
SegMamba. The code for SegMamba is available at:

<p class="mathjax">With the growing penetration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in power
systems, stability service markets have emerged to incentivize technologies
that ensure power system stability and reliability. Among the various
challenges faced in power system operation and stability, a prominent issue
raised from the increasing integration of large-scale IBRs is the significant
reduction of the Short-Circuit Current (SCC) level in the system, which poses a
considerable threat to system voltage stability and protection. Thus, a proper
market mechanism to incentivize the provision of SCC as a stability service is
desired. However, the pricing of this service within the future stability
market has not yet been fully developed, due to the nonconvex nature of SCC
constraints and the locational property of SCC. To address these problems, this
work aims to explore, for the first time, a pricing model for SCC service by
incorporating a linearized SCC constraint into the Unit Commitment (UC)
problem, to achieve the desired SCC level and extract the shadow price for SCC
through different pricing methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies an extremely large-scale reconfigurable intelligent
surface (XL-RIS) empowered covert communication system in the near-field
region. Alice covertly transmits messages to Bob with the assistance of the
XL-RIS, while evading detection by Willie. To enhance the covert communication
performance, we maximize the achievable covert rate by jointly optimizing the
hybrid analog and digital beamformers at Alice, as well as the reflection
coefficient matrix at the XL-RIS. An alternating optimization algorithm is
proposed to solve the joint beamforming design problem. For the hybrid
beamformer design, a semi-closed-form solution for fully digital beamformer is
first obtained by a weighted minimum mean-square error based algorithm, then
the baseband digital and analog beamformers at Alice are designed by
approximating the fully digital beamformer via manifold optimization. For the
XL-RIS's reflection coefficient matrix design, a low-complexity alternating
direction method of multipliers based algorithm is proposed to address the
challenge of large-scale variables and unit-modulus constraints. Numerical
results unveil that i) the near-field communications can achieve a higher
covert rate than the far-field covert communications in general, and still
realize covert transmission even if Willie is located at the same direction as
Bob and closer to the XL-RIS; ii) the proposed algorithm can enhance the covert
rate significantly compared to the benchmark schemes; iii) the proposed
algorithm leads to a beam diffraction pattern that can bypass Willie and
achieve high-rate covert transmission to Bob.

<p class="mathjax">When devising recommendation services, it is important to account for the
interests of all content providers, encompassing not only newcomers but also
minority demographic groups. In various instances, certain provider groups find
themselves underrepresented in the item catalog, a situation that can influence
recommendation results. Hence, platform owners often seek to regulate the
exposure of these provider groups in the recommended lists. In this paper, we
propose a novel cost-sensitive approach designed to guarantee these target
exposure levels in pairwise recommendation models. This approach quantifies,
and consequently mitigate, the discrepancies between the volume of
recommendations allocated to groups and their contribution in the item catalog,
under the principle of equity. Our results show that this approach, while
aligning groups exposure with their assigned levels, does not compromise to the
original recommendation utility. Source code and pre-processed data can be

<p class="mathjax">Biped robots usually adopt feet with a rigid structure that simplifies
walking on flat grounds and yet hinders ground adaptation in unstructured
environments, thus jeopardizing stability. We recently explored in the SoftFoot
the idea of adapting a robotic foot to ground irregularities along the sagittal
plane. Building on the previous results, we propose in this paper a novel
robotic foot able to adapt both in the sagittal and frontal planes, similarly
to the human foot. It features five parallel modules with intrinsic
longitudinal adaptability that can be combined in many possible designs through
optional rigid or elastic connections. By following a methodological design
approach, we narrow down the design space to five candidate foot designs and
implement them on a modular system. Prototypes are tested experimentally via
controlled application of force, through a robotic arm, onto a sensorized plate
endowed with different obstacles. Their performance is compared, using also a
rigid foot and the previous SoftFoot as a baseline. Analysis of footprint
stability shows that the introduction of the transverse arch, by elastically
connecting the five parallel modules, is advantageous for obstacle negotiation,
especially when obstacles are located under the forefoot. In addition to biped
robots' locomotion, this finding might also benefit lower-limb prostheses
design.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of cloud and edge computing, Internet of Things
(IoT) applications have been deployed in various aspects of human life. In this
paper, we design and implement a holistic LoRa-based IoT system with LoRa
communication capabilities, named SPARC-LoRa, which consists of field sensor
nodes and a gateway connected to the Internet. SPARC-LoRa has the following
important features. First, the proposed wireless network of SPARC-LoRa is
even-driven and using off-the-shelf microcontroller and LoRa communication
modules with a customized PCB design to integrate all the hardware. This
enables SPARC-LoRa to achieve low power consumption, long range communication,
and low cost. With a new connection-based upper layer protocol design, the
scalability and communication reliability of SPARC-loRa can be achieved.
Second, an open source software including sensor nodes and servers is designed
based on Docker container with cloud storage, computing, and LTE
functionalities. In order to achieve reliable wireless communication under
extreme conditions, a relay module is designed and applied to SPARC-LoRa to
forward the data from sensor nodes to the gateway node. The system design and
implementation is completely open source and hosted on the DigitalOcean Droplet
Cloud. Hence, the proposed system enables further research and applications in
both academia and industry. The proposed system has been tested in real fields
under different and extreme environmental conditions in Salt Lake City, Utah
and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The experimental results validate the
features of SPARC-LoRa including low power, reliability, and cloud services
provided by SPARC-LoRa.

<p class="mathjax">Mechanical metamaterial is a synthetic material that can possess
extraordinary physical characteristics, such as abnormal elasticity, stiffness,
and stability, by carefully designing its internal structure. To make
metamaterials contain delicate local structures with unique mechanical
properties, it is a potential method to represent them through high-resolution
voxels. However, it brings a substantial computational burden. To this end,
this paper proposes a fast inverse design method, whose core is an advanced
deep generative AI algorithm, to generate voxel-based mechanical metamaterials.
Specifically, we use the self-conditioned diffusion model, capable of
generating a microstructure with a resolution of $128^3$ to approach the
specified homogenized tensor matrix in just 3 seconds. Accordingly, this rapid
reverse design tool facilitates the exploration of extreme metamaterials, the
sequence interpolation in metamaterials, and the generation of diverse
microstructures for multi-scale design. This flexible and adaptive generative
tool is of great value in structural engineering or other mechanical systems
and can stimulate more subsequent research.

<p class="mathjax">This work explores an emerging security threat against deep neural networks
(DNNs) based image classification, i.e., backdoor attack. In this scenario, the
attacker aims to inject a backdoor into the model by manipulating training
data, such that the backdoor could be activated by a particular trigger and
bootstraps the model to make a target prediction at inference. Currently, most
existing data poisoning-based attacks struggle to achieve success at low
poisoning ratios, increasing the risk of being defended by defense methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel frequency-based backdoor attack via Wavelet
Packet Decomposition (WPD), WPD decomposes the original image signal to a
spectrogram that contains frequency information with different semantic
meanings. We leverage WPD to statistically analyze the frequency distribution
of the dataset to infer the key frequency regions the DNNs would focus on, and
the trigger information is only injected into the key frequency regions. Our
method mainly includes three parts: 1) the selection of the poisoning frequency
regions in spectrogram; 2) trigger generation; 3) the generation of the
poisoned dataset. Our method is stealthy and precise, evidenced by the 98.12%
Attack Success Rate (ASR) on CIFAR-10 with the extremely low poisoning ratio
0.004% (i.e., only 2 poisoned samples among 50,000 training samples) and can
bypass most existing defense methods. Besides, we also provide visualization
analyses to explain why our method works.

<p class="mathjax">Previous contrastive deep clustering methods mostly focus on instance-level
information while overlooking the member relationship within groups/clusters,
which may significantly undermine their representation learning and clustering
capability. Recently, some group-contrastive methods have been developed,
which, however, typically rely on the samples of the entire dataset to obtain
pseudo labels and lack the ability to efficiently update the group assignments
in a batch-wise manner. To tackle these critical issues, we present a novel
end-to-end deep clustering framework with dynamic grouping and prototype
aggregation, termed as DigPro. Specifically, the proposed dynamic grouping
extends contrastive learning from instance-level to group-level, which is
effective and efficient for timely updating groups. Meanwhile, we perform
contrastive learning on prototypes in a spherical feature space, termed as
prototype aggregation, which aims to maximize the inter-cluster distance.
Notably, with an expectation-maximization framework, DigPro simultaneously
takes advantage of compact intra-cluster connections, well-separated clusters,
and efficient group updating during the self-supervised training. Extensive
experiments on six image benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach over the state-of-the-art. Code is available at
https://github.com/Regan-Zhang/DigPro.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents an in-depth analysis of the security landscape in
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tracking systems, with a particular emphasis on
Apple AirTags and Samsung SmartTags, including their cryptographic frameworks.
Our investigation traverses a wide spectrum of attack vectors such as physical
tampering, firmware exploitation, signal spoofing, eavesdropping, jamming, app
security flaws, Bluetooth security weaknesses, location spoofing, threats to
owner devices, and cloud-related vulnerabilities. Moreover, we delve into the
security implications of the cryptographic methods utilized in these systems.
Our findings reveal that while BLE trackers like AirTags and SmartTags offer
substantial utility, they also pose significant security risks. Notably,
Apple's approach, which prioritizes user privacy by removing intermediaries,
inadvertently leads to device authentication challenges, evidenced by
successful AirTag spoofing instances. Conversely, Samsung SmartTags, designed
to thwart beacon spoofing, raise critical concerns about cloud security and
user privacy. Our analysis also highlights the constraints faced by these
devices due to their design focus on battery life conservation, particularly
the absence of secure boot processes, which leaves them susceptible to OS
modification and a range of potential attacks. The paper concludes with
insights into the anticipated evolution of these tracking systems. We predict
that future enhancements will likely focus on bolstering security features,
especially as these devices become increasingly integrated into the broader IoT
ecosystem and face evolving privacy regulations. This shift is imperative to
address the intricate balance between functionality and security in
next-generation BLE tracking systems.

<p class="mathjax">In robotic systems, perception latency is a term that refers to the computing
time measured from the data acquisition to the moment in which perception
output is ready to be used to compute control commands. There is a compromise
between perception latency, precision for the overall robotic system, and
computational resource usage referred to here as the latency-precision
trade-off. In this work, we analyze a robot model given by a linear system, a
zero-order hold controller, and measurements taken by several perception mode
possibilities with different noise levels. We show that the analysis of this
system is reduced to studying an equivalent switching system. Our goal is to
schedule perception modes such that stability is attained while optimizing a
cost function that models the latency-precision trade-off. Our solution
framework comprises three main tools: the construction of perception scheduling
policy candidates, admissibility verification for policy candidates, and
optimal strategies based on admissible policies.

<p class="mathjax">The challenging propagation environment, combined with the hardware
limitations of mmWave systems, gives rise to the need for accurate initial
access beam alignment strategies with low latency and high achievable
beamforming gain. Much of the recent work in this area either focuses on
one-sided beam alignment, or, joint beam alignment methods where both sides of
the link perform a sequence of fixed channel probing steps. Codebook-based
non-adaptive beam alignment schemes have the potential to allow multiple user
equipment (UE) to perform initial access beam alignment in parallel whereas
adaptive schemes are favourable in achievable beamforming gain. This work
introduces a novel deep learning based joint beam alignment scheme that aims to
combine the benefits of adaptive, codebook-free beam alignment at the UE side
with the advantages of a codebook-sweep based scheme at the base station. The
proposed end-to-end trainable scheme is compatible with current cellular
standard signaling and can be readily integrated into the standard without
requiring significant changes to it. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior
performance of the proposed approach over purely codebook-based ones.

<p class="mathjax">The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large
Language Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance. However, their
performance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored. Traditional
evaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced
contexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical
assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult
critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods,
including clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the
performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world
clinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and
then labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by
identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different
prompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior
performance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and
text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting
strategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable
efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.
Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for
LLMs is developed and operationalized. This framework goes beyond singular
performance aspects. With expert annotations, this methodology not only
validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also
establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we focus on task-specific question answering (QA). To this
end, we introduce a method for generating exhaustive and high-quality training
data, which allows us to train compact (e.g., run on a mobile device),
task-specific QA models that are competitive against GPT variants. The key
technological enabler is a novel mechanism for automatic question-answer
generation from procedural text which can ingest large amounts of textual
instructions and produce exhaustive in-domain QA training data. While current
QA data generation methods can produce well-formed and varied data, their
non-exhaustive nature is sub-optimal for training a QA model. In contrast, we
leverage the highly structured aspect of procedural text and represent each
step and the overall flow of the procedure as graphs. We then condition on
graph nodes to automatically generate QA pairs in an exhaustive and
controllable manner. Comprehensive evaluations of our method show that: 1)
small models trained with our data achieve excellent performance on the target
QA task, even exceeding that of GPT3 and ChatGPT despite being several orders
of magnitude smaller. 2) semantic coverage is the key indicator for downstream
QA performance. Crucially, while large language models excel at syntactic
diversity, this does not necessarily result in improvements on the end QA
model. In contrast, the higher semantic coverage provided by our method is
critical for QA performance.

<p class="mathjax">Target tracking is a popular problem with many potential applications. There
has been a lot of effort on improving the quality of the detection of targets
using cameras through different techniques. In general, with higher
computational effort applied, i.e., a longer perception-latency, a better
detection accuracy is obtained. However, it is not always useful to apply the
longest perception-latency allowed, particularly when the environment doesn't
require to and when the computational resources are shared between other tasks.
In this work, we propose a new Perception-LATency aware Estimator (PLATE),
which uses different perception configurations in different moments of time in
order to optimize a certain performance measure. This measure takes into
account a perception-latency and accuracy trade-off aiming for a good
compromise between quality and resource usage. Compared to other heuristic
frame-skipping techniques, PLATE comes with a formal complexity and optimality
analysis. The advantages of PLATE are verified by several experiments including
an evaluation over a standard benchmark with real data and using state of the
art deep learning object detection methods for the perception stage.

<p class="mathjax">Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE) is a fundamental task in
information systems that aims to simultaneously extract entities with semantic
relations from a document. Existing methods heavily rely on a substantial
amount of fully labeled data. However, collecting and annotating data for newly
emerging relations is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advanced Large
Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, exhibit impressive long-text
generation capabilities, inspiring us to explore an alternative approach for
obtaining auto-labeled documents with new relations. In this paper, we propose
a Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroDocRTE) framework,
which generates labeled data by retrieval and denoising knowledge from LLMs,
called GenRDK. Specifically, we propose a chain-of-retrieval prompt to guide
ChatGPT to generate labeled long-text data step by step. To improve the quality
of synthetic data, we propose a denoising strategy based on the consistency of
cross-document knowledge. Leveraging our denoised synthetic data, we proceed to
fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B-Chat for extracting document-level relation triplets.
We perform experiments for both zero-shot document-level relation and triplet
extraction on two public datasets. The experimental results illustrate that our
GenRDK framework outperforms strong baselines.

<p class="mathjax">In the past year, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have undergone
substantial advancements, augmenting off-the-shelf LLMs to support MM inputs or
outputs via cost-effective training strategies. The resulting models not only
preserve the inherent reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs but
also empower a diverse range of MM tasks. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive survey aimed at facilitating further research of MM-LLMs.
Specifically, we first outline general design formulations for model
architecture and training pipeline. Subsequently, we provide brief
introductions of $26$ existing MM-LLMs, each characterized by its specific
formulations. Additionally, we review the performance of MM-LLMs on mainstream
benchmarks and summarize key training recipes to enhance the potency of
MM-LLMs. Lastly, we explore promising directions for MM-LLMs while concurrently
maintaining a real-time tracking website for the latest developments in the
field. We hope that this survey contributes to the ongoing advancement of the
MM-LLMs domain.

<p class="mathjax">This work is devoted to the problem of distributed target tracking when a
team of robots detect the target through a variable perception-latency
mechanism. A reference for the robots to track is constructed in terms of a
desired formation around the estimation of the target position. However, it is
noted that due to the perception-latency, classical estimation techniques have
smoothness issues which prevent asymptotic stability for the formation control.
We propose a near-optimal smooth-output estimator which circumvents this issue.
Moreover, local estimations are fused using novel dynamic consensus techniques.
The advantages of the proposal as well as a comparison with a non-smooth
optimal alternative are discussed through simulation examples.

<p class="mathjax">Cognitive agent abstractions can help to engineer intelligent systems across
mobile devices. On smartphones, the data obtained from onboard sensors can give
valuable insights into the user's current situation. Unfortunately, today's
cognitive agent frameworks cannot cope well with the challenging
characteristics of sensor data. Sensor data is located on a low abstraction
level and the individual data elements are not meaningful when observed in
isolation. In contrast, cognitive agents operate on high-level percepts and
lack the means to effectively detect complex spatio-temporal patterns in
sequences of multiple percepts. In this paper, we present a stream-based
perception approach that enables the agents to perceive meaningful situations
in low-level sensor data streams. We present a crowdshipping case study where
autonomous, self-interested agents collaborate to deliver parcels to their
destinations. We show how situations derived from smartphone sensor data can
trigger and guide auctions, which the agents use to reach agreements.
Experiments with real smartphone data demonstrate the benefits of stream-based
agent perception.

<p class="mathjax">AI is increasingly being used in the public sector, including public
security. In this context, the use of AI-powered remote biometric
identification (RBI) systems is a much-discussed technology. RBI systems are
used to identify criminal activity in public spaces, but are criticised for
inheriting biases and violating fundamental human rights. It is therefore
important to ensure that such systems are developed in the public interest,
which means that any technology that is deployed for public use needs to be
scrutinised. While there is a consensus among business leaders, policymakers
and scientists that AI must be developed in an ethical and trustworthy manner,
scholars have argued that ethical guidelines do not guarantee ethical AI, but
rather prevent stronger regulation of AI. As a possible counterweight, public
opinion can have a decisive influence on policymakers to establish boundaries
and conditions under which AI systems should be used -- if at all. However, we
know little about the conditions that lead to regulatory demand for AI systems.
In this study, we focus on the role of trust in AI as well as trust in law
enforcement as potential factors that may lead to demands for regulation of AI
technology. In addition, we explore the mediating effects of discrimination
perceptions regarding RBI. We test the effects on four different use cases of
RBI varying the temporal aspect (real-time vs. post hoc analysis) and purpose
of use (persecution of criminals vs. safeguarding public events) in a survey
among German citizens. We found that German citizens do not differentiate
between the different modes of application in terms of their demand for RBI
regulation. Furthermore, we show that perceptions of discrimination lead to a
demand for stronger regulation, while trust in AI and trust in law enforcement
lead to opposite effects in terms of demand for a ban on RBI systems.

<p class="mathjax">There is great interest in minimizing the impact forces of reluctance
actuators during commutations, in order to reduce contact bouncing, acoustic
noise and mechanical wear. In this regard, a run-to-run control algorithm is
proposed to decrease the contact velocity, by exploiting the repetitive
operations of these devices. The complete control is presented, with special
focus on the optimization method and the input definition. The search method is
based on Bayesian optimization, and several additions are introduced for its
application in run-to-run control, e.g. the removal of stored points and the
definition of a new acquisition function. Additionally, methods for the input
parametrization and dimension reduction are presented. For analysis, Monte
Carlo simulations are performed using a dynamic model of a commercial solenoid
valve, comparing the proposed search method with two alternatives. Furthermore,
the control strategy is validated through experimental testing, using several
devices from the same ensemble of solenoid valves.

<p class="mathjax">Modelling learning objects (LO) within their context enables the learner to
advance from a basic, remembering-level, learning objective to a higher-order
one, i.e., a level with an application- and analysis objective. While
hierarchical data models are commonly used in digital learning platforms, using
graph-based models enables representing the context of LOs in those platforms.
This leads to a foundation for personalized recommendations of learning paths.
In this paper, the transformation of hierarchical data models into knowledge
graph (KG) models of LOs using text mining is introduced and evaluated. We
utilize custom text mining pipelines to mine semantic relations between
elements of an expert-curated hierarchical model. We evaluate the KG structure
and relation extraction using graph quality-control metrics and the comparison
of algorithmic semantic-similarities to expert-defined ones. The results show
that the relations in the KG are semantically comparable to those defined by
domain experts, and that the proposed KG improves representing and linking the
contexts of LOs through increasing graph communities and betweenness
centrality.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel vision-based control method to make a group of ground
mobile robots achieve a specified formation shape with unspecified size. Our
approach uses multiple aerial control units equipped with downward-facing
cameras, each observing a partial subset of the multirobot team. The units
compute the control commands from the ground robots' image projections, using
neither calibration nor scene scale information, and transmit them to the
robots. The control strategy relies on the calculation of image similarity
transformations, and we show it to be asymptotically stable if the overlaps
between the subsets of controlled robots satisfy certain conditions. The
presence of the supervisory units, which coordinate their motions to guarantee
a correct control performance, gives rise to a hybrid system topology. All in
all, the proposed system provides relevant practical advantages in simplicity
and flexibility. Within the problem of controlling a team shape, our
contribution lies in addressing several simultaneous challenges: the controller
needs only partial information of the robotic group, does not use distance
measurements or global reference frames, is designed for unicycle agents, and
can accommodate topology changes. We present illustrative simulation results.

intelligibility prediction. Recently, the use of feature representations
sourced from intermediate layers of pre-trained self-supervised and
weakly-supervised models has been found to be particularly useful for this
task. This work combines the use of Whisper ASR decoder layer representations
as neural network input features with an exemplar-based, psychologically
motivated model of human memory to predict human intelligibility ratings for
hearing-aid users. Substantial performance improvement over an established
intrusive HASPI baseline system is found, including on enhancement systems and

charge of keeping the network intermittently connected. We abstract the task
locations into a $1D$ cycle graph that is traversed by the communicating

location is periodically visited, with a worst--case revisiting time. Robots
move forward and backward along the cycle graph, exchanging data with their
previous and next neighbors when they meet, and updating their region
boundaries. Asymptotically, each robot is in charge of a region of the cycle
graph, depending on its capabilities. The method is distributed, and robots

<p class="mathjax">Photo search, the task of retrieving images based on textual queries, has
witnessed significant advancements with the introduction of CLIP (Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining) model. CLIP leverages a vision-language pre
training approach, wherein it learns a shared representation space for images
and text, enabling cross-modal understanding. This model demonstrates the
capability to understand the semantic relationships between diverse image and
text pairs, allowing for efficient and accurate retrieval of images based on
natural language queries. By training on a large-scale dataset containing
images and their associated textual descriptions, CLIP achieves remarkable
generalization, providing a powerful tool for tasks such as zero-shot learning
and few-shot classification. This abstract summarizes the foundational
principles of CLIP and highlights its potential impact on advancing the field
of photo search, fostering a seamless integration of natural language
understanding and computer vision for improved information retrieval in

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we tackle the problem of persistently covering a complex
non-convex environment with a team of robots. We consider scenarios where the
coverage quality of the environment deteriorates with time, requiring to
constantly revisit every point. As a first step, our solution finds a partition
of the environment where the amount of work for each robot, weighted by the
importance of each point, is equal. This is achieved using a power diagram and
finding an equitable partition through a provably correct distributed control
law on the power weights. Compared to other existing partitioning methods, our
solution considers a continuous environment formulation with non-convex
obstacles. In the second step, each robot computes a graph that gathers
sweep-like paths and covers its entire partition. At each planning time, the
coverage error at the graph vertices is assigned as weights of the
corresponding edges. Then, our solution is capable of efficiently finding the
optimal open coverage path through the graph with respect to the coverage error
per distance traversed. Simulation and experimental results are presented to
support our proposal.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive-learning-based methods have dominated sentence representation
learning. These methods regularize the representation space by pulling similar
sentence representations closer and pushing away the dissimilar ones and have
been proven effective in various NLP tasks, e.g., semantic textual similarity
(STS) tasks. However, it is challenging for these methods to learn fine-grained
semantics as they only learn from the inter-sentence perspective, i.e., their
supervision signal comes from the relationship between data samples. In this
work, we propose a novel denoising objective that inherits from another
perspective, i.e., the intra-sentence perspective. By introducing both discrete
and continuous noise, we generate noisy sentences and then train our model to
restore them to their original form. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
this approach delivers competitive results on both semantic textual similarity
(STS) and a wide range of transfer tasks, standing up well in comparison to
contrastive-learning-based methods. Notably, the proposed intra-sentence
denoising objective complements existing inter-sentence contrastive
methodologies and can be integrated with them to further enhance performance.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we propose a periodic solution to the problem of persistently
covering a finite set of interest points with a group of autonomous mobile
agents. These agents visit periodically the points and spend some time carrying
out the coverage task, which we call coverage time. Since this periodic
persistent coverage problem is NP-hard, we split it into three subproblems to
counteract its complexity. In the first place, we plan individual closed paths
for the agents to cover all the points. Second, we formulate a quadratically
constrained linear program to find the optimal coverage times and actions that
satisfy the coverage objective. Finally, we join together the individual plans
of the agents in a periodic team plan by obtaining a schedule that guarantees
collision avoidance. To this end, we solve a mixed integer linear program that
minimizes the time in which two or more agents move at the same time.
Eventually, we apply the proposed solution to an induction hob with mobile
inductors for a domestic heating application and show its performance with
experiments on a real prototype.

<p class="mathjax">Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineers are responsible for assessing a
product during every phase of the software development process to ensure that
the outcomes of each phase and the final product possess the desired qualities.
In general, a great SQA engineer needs to have a different set of abilities
from development engineers to effectively oversee the entire product
development process from beginning to end. Recent empirical studies identified
important attributes of software engineers and managers, but the quality
assurance role is overlooked. As software quality aspects have become more of a
priority in the life cycle of software development, employers seek
professionals that best suit the company's objectives and new graduates desire
to make a valuable contribution through their job as an SQA engineer, but what
makes them great? We addressed this knowledge gap by conducting 25
semi-structured interviews and 363 survey respondents with software quality
assurance engineers from different companies around the world. We use the data
collected from these activities to derive a comprehensive set of attributes
that are considered important. As a result of the interviews, twenty-five
attributes were identified and grouped into five main categories: personal,
social, technical, management, and decision-making attributes. Through a rating
survey, we confirmed that the distinguishing characteristics of great SQA
engineers are curiosity, the ability to communicate effectively, and critical
thinking skills. This work will guide further studies with SQA practitioners,
by considering contextual factors and providing some implications for research
and practice.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce SUPIR (Scaling-UP Image Restoration), a groundbreaking image
restoration method that harnesses generative prior and the power of model
scaling up. Leveraging multi-modal techniques and advanced generative prior,
SUPIR marks a significant advance in intelligent and realistic image
restoration. As a pivotal catalyst within SUPIR, model scaling dramatically
enhances its capabilities and demonstrates new potential for image restoration.
We collect a dataset comprising 20 million high-resolution, high-quality images
for model training, each enriched with descriptive text annotations. SUPIR
provides the capability to restore images guided by textual prompts, broadening
its application scope and potential. Moreover, we introduce negative-quality
prompts to further improve perceptual quality. We also develop a
restoration-guided sampling method to suppress the fidelity issue encountered
in generative-based restoration. Experiments demonstrate SUPIR's exceptional
restoration effects and its novel capacity to manipulate restoration through
textual prompts.

<p class="mathjax">Cooperative driving is an emerging paradigm to enhance the safety and
efficiency of autonomous vehicles. To ensure successful cooperation, road users
must reach a consensus for making collective decisions, while recording
vehicular data to analyze and address failures related to such agreements. This
data has the potential to provide valuable insights into various vehicular
events, while also potentially improving accountability measures. Furthermore,
vehicles may benefit from the ability to negotiate and trade services among
themselves, adding value to the cooperative driving framework. However, the
majority of proposed systems aiming to ensure data security, consensus, or
service trading, lack efficient and thoroughly validated mechanisms that
consider the distinctive characteristics of vehicular networks. These
limitations are amplified by a dependency on the centralized support provided
by the infrastructure. Furthermore, corresponding mechanisms must diligently
address security concerns, especially regarding potential malicious or
misbehaving nodes, while also considering inherent constraints of the wireless
medium. We introduce the Verifiable Event Extension (VEE), an applicational
extension designed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) messages. The
VEE operates seamlessly with any existing standardized vehicular communications
protocol, addressing crucial aspects of data security, consensus, and trading
with minimal overhead. To achieve this, we employ blockchain techniques,
Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols, and cryptocurrency-based
mechanics. To assess our proposal's feasibility and lightweight nature, we
employed a hardware-in-the-loop setup for analysis. Experimental results
demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the VEE extension in overcoming the
challenges posed by the distributed and opportunistic nature of wireless
vehicular communications.

<p class="mathjax">Different scheduling mechanisms in Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) can be
integrated together to design and support complex architectures with enhanced
capabilities for mixed critical networks. Integrating Frame Preemption (FP)
with Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) and Gate Control List (GCL) opens up different
modes and configuration choices resulting in a complex evaluation of several
possibilities and their impact on the Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper,
we implement and quantify the integration of preemptive CBS with GCL by
incorporating FP into the architecture. Our experiments show that the
end-to-end delay of Audio Video Bridging (AVB) flows shaped by CBS reduces
significantly (up to 40\%) when AVB flows are set to preemptable class. We
further show that the jitter of Time Triggered (TT) traffic remains unaffected
in "with Hold/Release" mode. Furthermore, we propose to introduce Guardband
(GB) in the "without Hold/Release" to reduce the jitter of the TT flow. We
compare all the different integration modes, starting with CBS with GCL,
extending it further to FP. We evaluate all feasible combinations in both
synthetic and realistic scenarios and offer recommendations for practical
configuration methods.

<p class="mathjax">We propose to explore the properties of raw point clouds through the
\emph{winding clearness}, a concept we first introduce for assessing the
clarity of the interior/exterior relationships represented by the winding
number field of the point cloud. In geometric modeling, the winding number is a
powerful tool for distinguishing the interior and exterior of a given surface
$\partial \Omega$, and it has been previously used for point normal orientation
and surface reconstruction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to
assess and optimize the quality of point clouds based on the winding clearness.
We observe that point clouds with reduced noise tend to exhibit improved
winding clearness. Accordingly, we propose an objective function that
quantifies the error in winding clearness, solely utilizing the positions of
the point clouds. Moreover, we demonstrate that the winding clearness error is
differentiable and can serve as a loss function in optimization-based and
learning-based point cloud processing. In the optimization-based method, the
loss function is directly back-propagated to update the point positions,
resulting in an overall improvement of the point cloud. In the learning-based
method, we incorporate the winding clearness as a geometric constraint in the
diffusion-based 3D generative model. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of optimizing the winding clearness in enhancing the quality of
the point clouds. Our method exhibits superior performance in handling noisy
point clouds with thin structures, highlighting the benefits of the global
perspective enabled by the winding number.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT developed by OpenAI, have already
shown astonishing results, introducing quick changes in our society. This has
been intensified by the release of ChatGPT which allows anyone to interact in a
simple conversational way with LLMs, without any experience in the field
needed. As a result, ChatGPT has been rapidly applied to many different tasks
such as code- and song-writer, education, virtual assistants, etc., showing
impressive results for tasks for which it was not trained (zero-shot learning).
<br />The present study aims to explore the ability of ChatGPT, based on the recent
GPT-4 multimodal LLM, for the task of face biometrics. In particular, we
analyze the ability of ChatGPT to perform tasks such as face verification,
soft-biometrics estimation, and explainability of the results. ChatGPT could be
very valuable to further increase the explainability and transparency of the
automatic decisions in human scenarios. Experiments are carried out in order to
evaluate the performance and robustness of ChatGPT, using popular public
benchmarks and comparing the results with state-of-the-art methods in the
field. The results achieved in this study show the potential of LLMs such as
ChatGPT for face biometrics, especially to enhance explainability. For
reproducibility reasons, we release all the code in GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">It is well known that to accelerate stencil codes on CPUs or GPUs and to
exploit hardware caches and their lines optimizers must find spatial and
temporal locality of array accesses to harvest data-reuse opportunities. On
FPGAs there is the burden that there are no built-in caches (or only pre-built
hardware descriptions for cache blocks that are inefficient for stencil codes).
But this paper demonstrates that this lack is also a chance as polyhedral
methods can be used to generate stencil-specific cache-structures of the right
sizes on the FPGA and to fill and flush them efficiently with wide bursts
during stencil execution. The paper shows how to derive the appropriate
directives and code restructurings from stencil codes so that the FPGA compiler
generates fast stencil hardware. Switching on our optimization improves the
runtime of a set of 10 stencils by between 43x and 156x.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and executing actions on
the web offer a promising avenue for automating computer tasks. However, the
majority of existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-based agents,
neglecting many natural tasks that require visual information to effectively
solve. Given that most computer interfaces cater to human perception, visual
information often augments textual data in ways that text-only models struggle
to harness effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualWebArena, a
benchmark designed to assess the performance of multimodal web agents on
realistic \textit{visually grounded tasks}. VisualWebArena comprises of a set
of diverse and complex web-based tasks that evaluate various capabilities of
autonomous multimodal agents. To perform on this benchmark, agents need to
accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions,
and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based autonomous
agents, including several multimodal models. Through extensive quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we identify several limitations of text-only LLM agents,
and reveal gaps in the capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal language
agents. VisualWebArena provides a framework for evaluating multimodal
autonomous language agents, and offers insights towards building stronger
autonomous agents for the web. Our code, baseline models, and data is publicly
available at https://jykoh.com/vwa.

<p class="mathjax">Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases
is fundamental to an attribute-based authentication system. In such systems,
either a single (central) authority verifies all attributes, or multiple
independent authorities verify individual attributes distributedly to allow a
user to access records stored on the servers. While a \emph{central} setup is
more communication cost efficient, it causes privacy breach of \emph{all} user
attributes to a central authority. Recently, Jafarpisheh et al. studied an
information theoretic formulation of the \emph{distributed} multi-authority
setup with $N$ non-colluding authorities, $N$ attributes and $K$ possible
values for each attribute, called an $(N,K)$ distributed attribute-based
private access control (DAPAC) system, where each server learns only one
attribute value that it verifies, and remains oblivious to the remaining $N-1$
attributes. We show that off-loading a subset of attributes to a central server

<p class="mathjax">The prevalent perspective in quantitative research on opinion dynamics
flattens the landscape of the online political discourse into a traditional
left--right dichotomy. While this approach helps simplify the analysis and
modeling effort, it also neglects the intrinsic multidimensional richness of
ideologies. In this study, we analyze social interactions on Reddit, under the
lens of a multi-dimensional ideological framework: the political compass. We
examine over 8 million comments posted on the subreddits /r/PoliticalCompass
and /r/PoliticalCompassMemes during 2020--2022. By leveraging their
self-declarations, we disentangle the ideological dimensions of users into
economic (left--right) and social (libertarian--authoritarian) axes. In
addition, we characterize users by their demographic attributes (age, gender,
and affluence).
<br />We find significant homophily for interactions along the social axis of the
political compass and demographic attributes. Compared to a null model,
interactions among individuals of similar ideology surpass expectations by 6%.
In contrast, we uncover a significant heterophily along the economic axis:
left/right interactions exceed expectations by 10%. Furthermore, heterophilic
interactions are characterized by a higher language toxicity than homophilic
interactions, which hints at a conflictual discourse between every opposite
ideology. Our results help reconcile apparent contradictions in recent
literature, which found a superposition of homophilic and heterophilic
interactions in online political discussions. By disentangling such
interactions into the economic and social axes we pave the way for a deeper
understanding of opinion dynamics on social media.

<p class="mathjax">Widespread adoption of AI for medical decision making is still hindered due
to ethical and safety-related concerns. For AI-based decision support systems
in healthcare settings it is paramount to be reliable and trustworthy. Common
deep learning approaches, however, have the tendency towards overconfidence
under data shift. Such inappropriate extrapolation beyond evidence-based
scenarios may have dire consequences. This highlights the importance of
reliable estimation of local uncertainty and its communication to the end user.
While stochastic neural networks have been heralded as a potential solution to
these issues, this study investigates their actual reliability in clinical
applications. We centered our analysis on the exemplary use case of mortality
prediction for ICU hospitalizations using EHR from MIMIC3 study. For
predictions on the EHR time series, Encoder-Only Transformer models were
employed. Stochasticity of model functions was achieved by incorporating common
methods such as Bayesian neural network layers and model ensembles. Our models
achieve state of the art performance in terms of discrimination performance
(AUC ROC: 0.868+-0.011, AUC PR: 0.554+-0.034) and calibration on the mortality
prediction benchmark. However, epistemic uncertainty is critically
underestimated by the selected stochastic deep learning methods. A heuristic
proof for the responsible collapse of the posterior distribution is provided.
Our findings reveal the inadequacy of commonly used stochastic deep learning
approaches to reliably recognize OoD samples. In both methods, unsubstantiated
model confidence is not prevented due to strongly biased functional posteriors,
rendering them inappropriate for reliable clinical decision support. This
highlights the need for approaches with more strictly enforced or inherent
distance-awareness to known data points, e.g., using kernel-based techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the bias
of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in significantly
longer sequences, and standard autoregressive Transformers scale poorly in such
settings. We experiment with MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba
state space model, trained autoregressively on byte sequences. Our experiments
indicate the computational efficiency of MambaByte compared to other byte-level
models. We also find MambaByte to be competitive with and even outperform
state-of-the-art subword Transformers. Furthermore, owing to linear scaling in
length, MambaByte benefits from fast inference compared to Transformers. Our

<p class="mathjax">Enabling passive sensing of the environment using cellular base stations
(BSs) will be one of the disruptive features of the sixth-generation (6G)
networks. However, accurate localization and positioning of objects are
challenging to achieve as multipath significantly degrades the reflected echos.
Existing localization techniques perform well under the assumption of large
bandwidth available but perform poorly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. To
alleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce a 5G New Radio (NR)-based
cooperative multi-monostatic sensing framework for passive target localization
that operates in the Frequency Range 1 (FR1) band. We propose a novel
fusion-based estimation process that can mitigate the effect of multipath by
assigning appropriate weight to the range estimation of each BS. Extensive
simulation results using ray-tracing demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
multi-sensing framework in bandwidth-limited scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Molecular docking is an important tool for structure-based drug design,
accelerating the efficiency of drug development. Complex and dynamic binding
processes between proteins and small molecules require searching and sampling
over a wide spatial range. Traditional docking by searching for possible
binding sites and conformations is computationally complex and results poorly
under blind docking. Quantum-inspired algorithms combining quantum properties
and annealing show great advantages in solving combinatorial optimization
problems. Inspired by this, we achieve an improved in blind docking by using
quantum-inspired combined with gradients learned by deep learning in the
encoded molecular space. Numerical simulation shows that our method outperforms
traditional docking algorithms and deep learning-based algorithms over 10\%.
Compared to the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based docking algorithm
DiffDock, the success rate of Top-1 (RMSD&lt;2) achieves an improvement from 33\%

programs using the QUBO solver. Quantum(-inspired) algorithms are recognized
for their potential efficiency in handling quadratic unconstrained binary

expressed using QUBO, it stands out as an exemplary case to demonstrate the
effectiveness of quantum(-inspired) QUBO approaches. Here, the non-zero count
in the QUBO matrix corresponds to the graph's edge count. Given that many
quantum(-inspired) solvers operate through cloud services, transmitting data
for dense graphs can be costly. By introducing the graph sparsification method,
we aim to mitigate these communication costs. Experimental results on
classical, quantum-inspired, and quantum solvers indicate that this approach
substantially reduces communication overheads and yields an objective value

<p class="mathjax">Over the past decade, the intricacies of sports-related concussions among
female athletes have become readily apparent. Traditional clinical methods for
diagnosing concussions suffer limitations when applied to female athletes,
often failing to capture subtle changes in brain structure and function.
Advanced neuroinformatics techniques and machine learning models have become
invaluable assets in this endeavor. While these technologies have been
extensively employed in understanding concussion in male athletes, there
remains a significant gap in our comprehension of their effectiveness for
female athletes. With its remarkable data analysis capacity, machine learning
offers a promising avenue to bridge this deficit. By harnessing the power of
machine learning, researchers can link observed phenotypic neuroimaging data to
sex-specific biological mechanisms, unraveling the mysteries of concussions in
female athletes. Furthermore, embedding methods within machine learning enable
examining brain architecture and its alterations beyond the conventional
anatomical reference frame. In turn, allows researchers to gain deeper insights
into the dynamics of concussions, treatment responses, and recovery processes.
To guarantee that female athletes receive the optimal care they deserve,
researchers must employ advanced neuroimaging techniques and sophisticated
machine-learning models. These tools enable an in-depth investigation of the
underlying mechanisms responsible for concussion symptoms stemming from
neuronal dysfunction in female athletes. This paper endeavors to address the
crucial issue of sex differences in multimodal neuroimaging experimental design
and machine learning approaches within female athlete populations, ultimately
ensuring that they receive the tailored care they require when facing the
challenges of concussions.

<p class="mathjax">Advancements in medical imaging and endovascular grafting have facilitated
minimally invasive treatments for aortic diseases. Accurate 3D segmentation of
the aorta and its branches is crucial for interventions, as inaccurate
segmentation can lead to erroneous surgical planning and endograft
construction. Previous methods simplified aortic segmentation as a binary image
segmentation problem, overlooking the necessity of distinguishing between
individual aortic branches. In this paper, we introduce Context Infused
Swin-UNet (CIS-UNet), a deep learning model designed for multi-class
segmentation of the aorta and thirteen aortic branches. Combining the strengths
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin transformers, CIS-UNet adopts
a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure comprising a CNN encoder, symmetric
decoder, skip connections, and a novel Context-aware Shifted Window
Self-Attention (CSW-SA) as the bottleneck block. Notably, CSW-SA introduces a
unique utilization of the patch merging layer, distinct from conventional Swin
transformers. It efficiently condenses the feature map, providing a global
spatial context and enhancing performance when applied at the bottleneck layer,
offering superior computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared
to the Swin transformers. We trained our model on computed tomography (CT)
scans from 44 patients and tested it on 15 patients. CIS-UNet outperformed the
state-of-the-art SwinUNetR segmentation model, which is solely based on Swin
transformers, by achieving a superior mean Dice coefficient of 0.713 compared
to 0.697, and a mean surface distance of 2.78 mm compared to 3.39 mm.
CIS-UNet's superior 3D aortic segmentation offers improved precision and
optimization for planning endovascular treatments. Our dataset and code will be
publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">We present a tensor train (TT) based algorithm designed for sampling from a
target distribution and employ TT approximation to capture the high-dimensional
probability density evolution of overdamped Langevin dynamics. This involves
utilizing the regularized Wasserstein proximal operator, which exhibits a
simple kernel integration formulation, i.e., the softmax formula of the
traditional proximal operator. The integration, performed in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
poses a challenge in practical scenarios, making the algorithm practically
implementable only with the aid of TT approximation. In the specific context of
Gaussian distributions, we rigorously establish the unbiasedness and linear
convergence of our sampling algorithm towards the target distribution. To
assess the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we apply them to various
scenarios, including Gaussian families, Gaussian mixtures, bimodal
distributions, and Bayesian inverse problems in numerical examples. The
sampling algorithm exhibits superior accuracy and faster convergence when
compared to classical Langevin dynamics-type sampling algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is widely applied for the
diagnosis of coronary artery diseases. Low-dose (LD) SPECT aims to minimize
radiation exposure but leads to increased image noise. Limited-view (LV) SPECT,
such as the latest GE MyoSPECT ES system, enables accelerated scanning and
reduces hardware expenses but degrades reconstruction accuracy. Additionally,
Computed Tomography (CT) is commonly used to derive attenuation maps
($\mu$-maps) for attenuation correction (AC) of cardiac SPECT, but it will
introduce additional radiation exposure and SPECT-CT misalignments. Although
various methods have been developed to solely focus on LD denoising, LV
reconstruction, or CT-free AC in SPECT, the solution for simultaneously
addressing these tasks remains challenging and under-explored. Furthermore, it
is essential to explore the potential of fusing cross-domain and cross-modality
information across these interrelated tasks to further enhance the accuracy of
each task. Thus, we propose a Dual-Domain Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Network
(DuDoCFNet), a multi-task learning method for simultaneous LD denoising, LV
reconstruction, and CT-free $\mu$-map generation of cardiac SPECT. Paired
dual-domain networks in DuDoCFNet are cascaded using a multi-layer fusion
mechanism for cross-domain and cross-modality feature fusion. Two-stage
progressive learning strategies are applied in both projection and image
domains to achieve coarse-to-fine estimations of SPECT projections and
CT-derived $\mu$-maps. Our experiments demonstrate DuDoCFNet's superior
accuracy in estimating projections, generating $\mu$-maps, and AC
reconstructions compared to existing single- or multi-task learning methods,
under various iterations and LD levels. The source code of this work is
available at https://github.com/XiongchaoChen/DuDoCFNet-MultiTask.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) still face challenges when recognizing
time-variant rare-phrases. Contextual biasing (CB) modules bias ASR model
towards such contextually-relevant phrases. During training, a list of biasing
phrases are selected from a large pool of phrases following a sampling
strategy. In this work we firstly analyse different sampling strategies to
provide insights into the training of CB for ASR with correlation plots between
the bias embeddings among various training stages. Secondly, we introduce a
neighbourhood attention (NA) that localizes self attention (SA) to the nearest
neighbouring frames to further refine the CB output. The results show that this

LibriSpeech sets and rare-word evaluation compared to the baseline.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a deep convolutional auto-encoder network for filtering
reverberation artifacts, from transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) image
sequences. Given the spatiotemporal nature of these artifacts, the filtering
network was built using 3D convolutional layers to suppress the clutter
patterns throughout the cardiac cycle. The network was designed by taking
advantage of: i) an attention mechanism to focus primarily on cluttered regions
and ii) residual learning to preserve fine structures of the image frames. To
train the deep network, a diverse set of artifact patterns was simulated and
the simulated patterns were superimposed onto artifact-free ultra-realistic
synthetic TTE sequences of six ultrasound vendors to generate input of the
filtering network. The artifact-free sequences served as ground-truth.
Performance of the filtering network was evaluated using unseen synthetic as
well as in-vivo artifactual sequences. Satisfactory results obtained using the
latter dataset confirmed the good generalization performance of the proposed
network which was trained using the synthetic sequences and simulated artifact
patterns. Suitability of the clutter-filtered sequences for further processing
was assessed by computing segmental strain curves from them. The results showed
that the large discrepancy between the strain profiles computed from the
cluttered segments and their corresponding segments in the clutter-free images
was significantly reduced after filtering the sequences using the proposed
network. The trained deep network could process an artifactual TTE sequence in
a fraction of a second and can be used for real-time clutter filtering.
Moreover, it can improve the precision of the clinical indexes that are
computed from the TTE sequences. The source code of the proposed method is
available at:

<p class="mathjax">The fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fDNLS) is studied
on a periodic lattice from the analytic and dynamic perspective by varying the
mesh size $h&gt;0$ and the nonlocal L\'evy index $\alpha \in (0,2]$. We show that
the discrete system converges to the fractional NLS as $h \rightarrow 0$ below
the energy space by directly estimating the difference between the discrete and
continuum solutions in $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ using the periodic Strichartz
estimates. The sharp convergence rate via the finite-difference method is shown
to be $O(h^{\frac{\alpha}{2+\alpha}})$ in the energy space. On the other hand
for a fixed $h &gt; 0$, the linear stability analysis on a family of continuous
wave (CW) solutions reveals a rich dynamical structure of CW waves due to the
interplay between nonlinearity, nonlocal dispersion, and discreteness. The gain
spectrum is derived to understand the role of $h$ and $\alpha$ in triggering
higher mode excitations. The transition from the quadratic dependence of
maximum gain on the amplitude of CW solutions to the linear dependence, due to
the lattice structure, is shown analytically and numerically.

utilized for the treatment of mitral valve disorders. However, predicting the
outcome of the procedure poses a significant challenge. This paper makes the
first attempt to harness classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
techniques for predicting mitral valve mTEER surgery outcomes. To achieve this,
we compiled a dataset from 467 patients, encompassing labeled echocardiogram
videos and patient reports containing Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)
measurements detailing Mitral Valve Repair (MVR) treatment outcomes. Leveraging
this dataset, we conducted a benchmark evaluation of six ML algorithms and two

<p class="mathjax">A species' genetic code or genome encodes valuable evolutionary, biological,
and phylogenetic information that aids in species recognition, taxonomic
classification, and understanding genetic predispositions like drug resistance
and virulence. However, the vast number of potential species poses significant
challenges in developing a general-purpose whole genome classification tool.
Traditional bioinformatics tools have made notable progress but lack
scalability and are computationally expensive. Machine learning-based
frameworks show promise but must address the issue of large classification
vocabularies with long-tail distributions. In this study, we propose addressing
this problem through zero-shot learning using TEPI, Taxonomy-aware Embedding
and Pseudo-Imaging. We represent each genome as pseudo-images and map them to a
taxonomy-aware embedding space for reasoning and classification. This embedding
space captures compositional and phylogenetic relationships of species,
enabling predictions in extensive search spaces. We evaluate TEPI using two
rigorous zero-shot settings and demonstrate its generalization capabilities
qualitatively on curated, large-scale, publicly sourced data.

pretrain-prompting models such as ChatGPT and Segmentation Anything Model (SAM)
has further revolutionized image segmentation. However, their applications in
specialized areas, particularly in nuclei segmentation within medical imaging,
reveal a key challenge: the generation of high-quality, informative prompts is
as crucial as applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) fine-tuning techniques on
foundation models. To address this, we introduce Segment Any Cell (SAC), an
innovative framework that enhances SAM specifically for nuclei segmentation.
SAC integrates a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) within the attention layer of the
Transformer to improve the fine-tuning process, outperforming existing SOTA
methods. It also introduces an innovative auto-prompt generator that produces
effective prompts to guide segmentation, a critical factor in handling the
complexities of nuclei segmentation in biomedical imaging. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of SAC in nuclei segmentation tasks,
proving its effectiveness as a tool for pathologists and researchers. Our
contributions include a novel prompt generation strategy, automated

Low-Rank Attention Adaptation in SAM, and a versatile framework for semantic

<p class="mathjax">Natural gradient (NG) is an information-geometric optimization method that
plays a crucial role, especially in the estimation of parameters for machine
learning models like neural networks. To apply NG to quantum systems, the
quantum natural gradient (QNG) was introduced and utilized for noisy
intermediate-scale devices. Additionally, a mathematically equivalent approach
to QNG, known as the stochastic reconfiguration method, has been implemented to
enhance the performance of quantum Monte Carlo methods. It is worth noting that
these methods are based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric,
which is one of the monotone metrics. So far, monotonicity has been believed to
be a guiding principle to construct a geometry in physics. In this paper, we
propose generalized QNG by removing the condition of monotonicity. Initially,
we demonstrate that monotonicity is a crucial condition for conventional QNG to
be optimal. Subsequently, we provide analytical and numerical evidence showing
that non-monotone QNG outperforms conventional QNG based on the SLD metric in
terms of convergence speed.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the equations of cross valuation adjustments (XVAs) in the
realistic case where capital is deemed fungible as a source of funding for
variation margin, we introduce a simulation/regression scheme for a class of
anticipated BSDEs, where the coefficient entails a conditional expected
shortfall of the martingale part of the solution. The scheme is explicit in
time and uses neural network least-squares and quantile regressions for the
embedded conditional expectations and expected shortfall computations. An a
posteriori Monte Carlo validation procedure allows assessing the regression
error of the scheme at each time step. The superiority of this scheme with
respect to Picard iterations is illustrated in a high-dimensional and hybrid
market/default risks XVA use-case.

<p class="mathjax">To cope with the growing prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC), screening
programs for polyp detection and removal have proven their usefulness.
Colonoscopy is considered the best-performing procedure for CRC screening. To
ease the examination, deep learning based methods for automatic polyp detection
have been developed for conventional white-light imaging (WLI). Compared with
WLI, narrow-band imaging (NBI) can improve polyp classification during
colonoscopy but requires special equipment. We propose a CycleGAN-based
framework to convert images captured with regular WLI to synthetic NBI (SNBI)
as a pre-processing method for improving object detection on WLI when NBI is
unavailable. This paper first shows that better results for polyp detection can
be achieved on NBI compared to a relatively similar dataset of WLI. Secondly,
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed modality translation can
achieve improved polyp detection on SNBI images generated from WLI compared to
the original WLI. This is because our WLI-to-SNBI translation model can enhance
the observation of polyp surface patterns in the generated SNBI images.

<p class="mathjax">Significance testing aims to determine whether a proposition about the
population distribution is the truth or not given observations. However,
traditional significance testing often needs to derive the distribution of the
testing statistic, failing to deal with complex nonlinear relationships. In
this paper, we propose to conduct Full Bayesian Significance Testing for neural
networks, called \textit{n}FBST, to overcome the limitation in relationship
characterization of traditional approaches. A Bayesian neural network is
utilized to fit the nonlinear and multi-dimensional relationships with small
errors and avoid hard theoretical derivation by computing the evidence value.
Besides, \textit{n}FBST can test not only global significance but also local
and instance-wise significance, which previous testing methods don't focus on.
Moreover, \textit{n}FBST is a general framework that can be extended based on
the measures selected, such as Grad-\textit{n}FBST, LRP-\textit{n}FBST,
DeepLIFT-\textit{n}FBST, LIME-\textit{n}FBST. A range of experiments on both
simulated and real data are conducted to show the advantages of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Stablecoins have turned out to be the "killer" use case of the growing
digital asset space. However, risk management frameworks, including regulatory
ones, have been largely absent. In this paper, we address the critical question
of measuring and managing risk in stablecoin protocols, which operate on public
blockchain infrastructure. The on-chain environment makes it possible to
monitor risk and automate its management via transparent smart-contracts in
real-time. We propose two risk metrics covering capitalization and liquidity of
stablecoin protocols. We then explore in a case-study type analysis how our
risk management framework can be applied to DAI, the biggest decentralized
stablecoin by market capitalisation to-date, governed by MakerDAO. Based on our
findings, we recommend that the protocol explores implementing automatic
capital buffer adjustments and dynamic maturity gap matching. Our analysis
demonstrates the practical benefits for scalable (prudential) risk management
stemming from real-time availability of high-quality, granular,
tamper-resistant on-chain data in the digital asset space. We name this
approach Crypto Asset-Liability Management (CALM).

<p class="mathjax">Despite the advancement in computational modeling towards brain tumor
segmentation, of which several models have been developed, it is evident from
the computational complexity of existing models which are still at an all-time
high, that performance and efficiency under clinical application scenarios are
limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a shallow encoder and decoder network
named SEDNet for brain tumor segmentation. The proposed network is adapted from
the U-Net structure. Though brain tumors do not assume complex structures like
the task the traditional U-Net was designed for, their variance in appearance,
shape, and ambiguity of boundaries makes it a compelling complex task to solve.
SEDNet architecture design is inspired by the localized nature of brain tumors
in brain images, thus consists of sufficient hierarchical convolutional blocks
in the encoding pathway capable of learning the intrinsic features of brain
tumors in brain slices, and a decoding pathway with selective skip path
sufficient for capturing miniature local-level spatial features alongside the
global-level features of brain tumor. SEDNet with the integration of the
proposed preprocessing algorithm and optimization function on the BraTS2020 set
reserved for testing achieves impressive dice and Hausdorff scores of 0.9308,
0.9451, 0.9026, and 0.7040, 1.2866, 0.7762 for non-enhancing tumor core (NTC),
peritumoral edema (ED), and enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. Furthermore,
through transfer learning with initialized SEDNet pre-trained weights, termed
SEDNetX, a performance increase is observed. The dice and Hausdorff scores
recorded are 0.9336, 0.9478, 0.9061, 0.6983, 1.2691, and 0.7711 for NTC, ED,
and ET, respectively. With about 1.3 million parameters and impressive
performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art, SEDNet(X) is shown to be
computationally efficient for real-time clinical diagnosis.

<p class="mathjax">The privacy in classical federated learning can be breached through the use
of local gradient results by using engineered queries from the clients.
However, quantum communication channels are considered more secure because the
use of measurements in the data causes some loss of information, which can be
detected. Therefore, the quantum version of federated learning can be used to
provide more privacy. Additionally, sending an $N$ dimensional data vector
through a quantum channel requires sending $\log N$ entangled qubits, which can
provide exponential efficiency if the data vector is obtained as quantum
states.
<br />In this paper, we propose a quantum federated learning model where fixed
design quantum chips are operated based on the quantum states sent by a
centralized server. Based on the coming superposition states, the clients
compute and then send their local gradients as quantum states to the server,
where they are aggregated to update parameters. Since the server does not send
model parameters, but instead sends the operator as a quantum state, the
clients are not required to share the model. This allows for the creation of
asynchronous learning models. In addition, the model as a quantum state is fed
into client-side chips directly; therefore, it does not require measurements on
the upcoming quantum state to obtain model parameters in order to compute
gradients. This can provide efficiency over the models where parameter vector
is sent via classical or quantum channels and local gradients are obtained
through the obtained values of these parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Z-disks are complex structures that delineate repeating sarcomeres in
striated muscle. They play significant roles in cardiomyocytes such as
providing mechanical stability for the contracting sarcomere, cell signalling
and autophagy. Changes in Z-disk architecture have been associated with
impaired cardiac function. Hence, there is a strong need to create tools to
segment Z-disks from microscopy images, that overcome traditional limitations
such as variability in image brightness and staining technique. In this study,
we apply deep learning based segmentation models to extract Z-disks in images
of striated muscle tissue. We leverage a novel Airyscan confocal dataset, which
comprises high resolution images of Z-disks of healthy heart tissue, stained
with Affimers for specific Z-disk proteins. We employed an interactive
labelling tool, Ilastik to obtain ground truth segmentation masks and use the
resulting data set to train and evaluate the performance of several
state-of-the-art segmentation networks. On the test set, UNet++ achieves best
segmentation performance for Z-disks in cardiomyocytes, with an average Dice
score of 0.91 and outperforms other established segmentation methods including
UNet, FPN, DeepLabv3+ and pix2pix. However, pix2pix demonstrates improved
generalisation, when tested on an additional dataset of cardiomyocytes with a
titin mutation. This is the first study to demonstrate that automated machine
learning-based segmentation approaches may be used effectively to segment
Z-disks in confocal microscopy images. Automated segmentation approaches and
predicted segmentation masks could be used to derive morphological features of
Z-disks (e.g. width and orientation), and subsequently, to quantify
disease-related changes to cardiac microstructure.

<p class="mathjax">Tissue segmentation is a routine preprocessing step to reduce the
computational cost of whole slide image (WSI) analysis by excluding background
regions. Traditional image processing techniques are commonly used for tissue
segmentation, but often require manual adjustments to parameter values for
atypical cases, fail to exclude all slide and scanning artifacts from the
background, and are unable to segment adipose tissue. Pen marking artifacts in
particular can be a potential source of bias for subsequent analyses if not
removed. In addition, several applications require the separation of individual
cross-sections, which can be challenging due to tissue fragmentation and
adjacent positioning. To address these problems, we develop a convolutional
neural network for tissue and pen marking segmentation using a dataset of 200
H&amp;E stained WSIs. For separating tissue cross-sections, we propose a novel
post-processing method based on clustering predicted centroid locations of the
cross-sections in a 2D histogram. On an independent test set, the model
achieved a mean Dice score of 0.981$\pm$0.033 for tissue segmentation and a
mean Dice score of 0.912$\pm$0.090 for pen marking segmentation. The mean
absolute difference between the number of annotated and separated
cross-sections was 0.075$\pm$0.350. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
model can accurately segment H&amp;E stained tissue cross-sections and pen markings
in WSIs while being robust to many common slide and scanning artifacts. The
model with trained model parameters and post-processing method are made
publicly available as a Python package called SlideSegmenter.

<p class="mathjax">Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic
combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view
that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary
and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they
play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet
and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of
integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$,
i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some
language strictly included in the set of all words on the alphabet $\{0, 1,
\dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend
results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En
route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $q$-automatic sequences or
$q$-regular sequences.

<p class="mathjax">We propose \textit{masked particle modeling} (MPM) as a self-supervised
method for learning generic, transferable, and reusable representations on
unordered sets of inputs for use in high energy physics (HEP) scientific data.
This work provides a novel scheme to perform masked modeling based pre-training
to learn permutation invariant functions on sets. More generally, this work
provides a step towards building large foundation models for HEP that can be
generically pre-trained with self-supervised learning and later fine-tuned for
a variety of down-stream tasks. In MPM, particles in a set are masked and the
training objective is to recover their identity, as defined by a discretized
token representation of a pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoder.
We study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider
physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization,
permutation invariance, and ordering. We also study the fine-tuning capability
of the model, showing that it can be adapted to tasks such as supervised and
weakly supervised jet classification, and that the model can transfer
efficiently with small fine-tuning data sets to new classes and new data
domains.

<p class="mathjax">In proof-theoretic semantics, meaning is based on inference. It may seen as
the mathematical expression of the inferentialist interpretation of logic. Much
recent work has focused on base-extension semantics, in which the validity of
formulas is given by an inductive definition generated by provability in a
`base' of atomic rules. Base-extension semantics for classical and
intuitionistic propositional logic have been explored by several authors. In
this paper, we develop base-extension semantics for the classical propositional
modal systems K, KT , K4, and S4, with $\square$ as the primary modal operator.
We establish appropriate soundness and completeness theorems and establish the
duality between $\square$ and a natural presentation of $\lozenge$. We also
show that our semantics is in its current form not complete with respect to
euclidean modal logics. Our formulation makes essential use of relational
structures on bases.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, DNN models for lossless image coding have surpassed their
traditional counterparts in compression performance, reducing the bit rate by
about ten percent for natural color images. But even with these advances,
mathematically lossless image compression (MLLIC) ratios for natural images
still fall short of the bandwidth and cost-effectiveness requirements of most
practical imaging and vision systems at present and beyond. To break the
bottleneck of MLLIC in compression performance, we question the necessity of
MLLIC, as almost all digital sensors inherently introduce acquisition noises,
making mathematically lossless compression counterproductive. Therefore, in
contrast to MLLIC, we propose a new paradigm of joint denoising and compression
called functionally lossless image compression (FLLIC), which performs lossless
compression of optimally denoised images (the optimality may be task-specific).
Although not literally lossless with respect to the noisy input, FLLIC aims to
achieve the best possible reconstruction of the latent noise-free original
image. Extensive experiments show that FLLIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance in joint denoising and compression of noisy images and does so at a
lower computational cost.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial training is a widely used method to improve the robustness of
deep neural networks (DNNs) over adversarial perturbations. However, it is
empirically observed that adversarial training on over-parameterized networks
often suffers from the \textit{robust overfitting}: it can achieve almost zero
adversarial training error while the robust generalization performance is not
promising. In this paper, we provide a theoretical understanding of the
question of whether overfitted DNNs in adversarial training can generalize from
an approximation viewpoint. Specifically, our main results are summarized into
three folds: i) For classification, we prove by construction the existence of
infinitely many adversarial training classifiers on over-parameterized DNNs
that obtain arbitrarily small adversarial training error (overfitting), whereas
achieving good robust generalization error under certain conditions concerning
the data quality, well separated, and perturbation level. ii) Linear
over-parameterization (meaning that the number of parameters is only slightly
larger than the sample size) is enough to ensure such existence if the target
function is smooth enough. iii) For regression, our results demonstrate that
there also exist infinitely many overfitted DNNs with linear
over-parameterization in adversarial training that can achieve almost optimal
rates of convergence for the standard generalization error. Overall, our
analysis points out that robust overfitting can be avoided but the required
model capacity will depend on the smoothness of the target function, while a
robust generalization gap is inevitable. We hope our analysis will give a
better understanding of the mathematical foundations of robustness in DNNs from
an approximation view.

<p class="mathjax">Existing learning-based solutions to medical image segmentation have two
important shortcomings. First, for most new segmentation task, a new model has
to be trained or fine-tuned. This requires extensive resources and machine
learning expertise, and is therefore often infeasible for medical researchers
and clinicians. Second, most existing segmentation methods produce a single
deterministic segmentation mask for a given image. In practice however, there
is often considerable uncertainty about what constitutes the correct
segmentation, and different expert annotators will often segment the same image
differently. We tackle both of these problems with Tyche, a model that uses a
context set to generate stochastic predictions for previously unseen tasks
without the need to retrain. Tyche differs from other in-context segmentation
methods in two important ways. (1) We introduce a novel convolution block
architecture that enables interactions among predictions. (2) We introduce
in-context test-time augmentation, a new mechanism to provide prediction
stochasticity. When combined with appropriate model design and loss functions,
Tyche can predict a set of plausible diverse segmentation candidates for new or
unseen medical images and segmentation tasks without the need to retrain.
