<p class="mathjax">Primary care professionals struggle to keep up to date with the latest
scientific literature critical in guiding evidence-based practice related to
their daily work. To help solve the above-mentioned problem, we employed
generative artificial intelligence techniques based on large-scale language
models to summarize abstracts of scientific papers. Our objective is to
investigate the potential of generative artificial intelligence in diminishing
the cognitive load experienced by practitioners, thus exploring its ability to
alleviate mental effort and burden. The study participants were provided with
two use cases related to preventive care and behavior change, simulating a
search for new scientific literature. The study included 113 university
students from Slovenia and the United States randomized into three distinct
study groups. The first group was assigned to the full abstracts. The second
group was assigned to the short abstracts generated by AI. The third group had
the option to select a full abstract in addition to the AI-generated short
summary. Each use case study included ten retrieved abstracts. Our research
demonstrates that the use of generative AI for literature review is efficient
and effective. The time needed to answer questions related to the content of
abstracts was significantly lower in groups two and three compared to the first
group using full abstracts. The results, however, also show significantly lower
accuracy in extracted knowledge in cases where full abstract was not available.
Such a disruptive technology could significantly reduce the time required for
healthcare professionals to keep up with the most recent scientific literature;
nevertheless, further developments are needed to help them comprehend the
knowledge accurately.

<p class="mathjax">The drug development process necessitates that pharmacologists undertake
various tasks, such as reviewing literature, formulating hypotheses, designing
experiments, and interpreting results. Each stage requires accessing and
querying vast amounts of information. In this abstract, we introduce a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Interface designed to interact with
structured information stored in databases. Our experiments demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. This framework can
generalize to query a wide range of pharmaceutical data and knowledge bases.

<p class="mathjax">Initial hours of hospital admission impact clinical trajectory, but early
clinical decisions often suffer due to data paucity. With clustering analysis
for vital signs within six hours of admission, patient phenotypes with distinct
pathophysiological signatures and outcomes may support early clinical
decisions. We created a single-center, longitudinal EHR dataset for 75,762
adults admitted to a tertiary care center for 6+ hours. We proposed a deep
temporal interpolation and clustering network to extract latent representations
from sparse, irregularly sampled vital sign data and derived distinct patient
phenotypes in a training cohort (n=41,502). Model and hyper-parameters were
chosen based on a validation cohort (n=17,415). Test cohort (n=16,845) was used
to analyze reproducibility and correlation with biomarkers. The training,
validation, and testing cohorts had similar distributions of age (54-55 yrs),
sex (55% female), race, comorbidities, and illness severity. Four clusters were
identified. Phenotype A (18%) had most comorbid disease with higher rate of
prolonged respiratory insufficiency, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and
three-year mortality. Phenotypes B (33%) and C (31%) had diffuse patterns of
mild organ dysfunction. Phenotype B had favorable short-term outcomes but
second-highest three-year mortality. Phenotype C had favorable clinical
outcomes. Phenotype D (17%) had early/persistent hypotension, high rate of
early surgery, and substantial biomarker rate of inflammation but second-lowest
three-year mortality. After comparing phenotypes' SOFA scores, clustering
results did not simply repeat other acuity assessments. In a heterogeneous
cohort, four phenotypes with distinct categories of disease and outcomes were
identified by a deep temporal interpolation and clustering network. This tool
may impact triage decisions and clinical decision-support under time
constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Compartmental epidemiological models categorize individuals based on their
disease status, such as the SEIRD model
(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead). These models determine the
parameters that influence the magnitude of an outbreak, such as contagion and
recovery rates. However, they don't account for individual characteristics or
population actions, which are crucial for assessing mitigation strategies like
mask usage in COVID-19 or condom distribution in HIV. Additionally, studies
highlight the role of citizen solidarity, interpersonal trust, and government
credibility in explaining differences in contagion rates between countries.
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) offers a valuable approach to study complex systems
by simulating individual components, their actions, and interactions within an
environment. ABM provides a useful tool for analyzing social phenomena. In this
study, we propose an ABM architecture that combines an adapted SEIRD model with
a decision-making model for citizens. In this paper, we propose an ABM
architecture that allows us to analyze the evolution of virus infections in a
society based on two components: 1) an adaptation of the SEIRD model and 2) a
decision-making model for citizens. In this way, the evolution of infections is
affected, in addition to the spread of the virus itself, by individual behavior
when accepting or rejecting public health measures. We illustrate the designed
model by examining the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections in A Coru\~na,
Spain. This approach makes it possible to analyze the effect of the individual
actions of citizens during an epidemic on the spread of the virus.

<p class="mathjax">Curiosity is one of the main motives in many of the natural creatures with
measurable levels of intelligence for exploration and, as a result, more
efficient learning. It makes it possible for humans and many animals to explore
efficiently by searching for being in states that make them surprised with the
goal of learning more about what they do not know. As a result, while being
curious, they learn better. In the machine learning literature, curiosity is
mostly combined with reinforcement learning-based algorithms as an intrinsic
reward. This work proposes an algorithm based on the drive of curiosity for
autonomous learning to control by generating proper motor speeds from odometry
data. The quadcopter controlled by our proposed algorithm can pass through
obstacles while controlling the Yaw direction of the quad-copter toward the
desired location. To achieve that, we also propose a new curiosity approach
based on prediction error. We ran tests using on-policy, off-policy, on-policy
plus curiosity, and the proposed algorithm and visualized the effect of
curiosity in evolving exploration patterns. Results show the capability of the
proposed algorithm to learn optimal policy and maximize reward where other
algorithms fail to do so.

forecasting towards one of anticipatory action: assessing not just what the
climate will be, but how it will impact specific populations, thereby enabling
proactive response and resource allocation. Machine learning models are
becoming exceptionally powerful at climate forecasting, but methodological gaps
remain in terms of facilitating anticipatory action. Here we provide an
overview of anticipatory action, review relevant applications of machine
learning, identify common challenges, and highlight areas where machine
learning can uniquely contribute to advancing disaster response for populations
most vulnerable to climate change.

<p class="mathjax">What neural networks learn depends fundamentally on the geometry of the
underlying loss function. We study how different regularizers affect the
geometry of this function. One of the most basic geometric properties of a
smooth function is whether it is Morse or not. For nonlinear deep neural
networks, the unregularized loss function $L$ is typically not Morse. We
consider several different regularizers, including weight decay, and study for
which regularizers the regularized function $L_\epsilon$ becomes Morse.

<p class="mathjax">Visual question answering (VQA) has the potential to make the Internet more
accessible in an interactive way, allowing people who cannot see images to ask
questions about them. However, multiple studies have shown that people who are
blind or have low-vision prefer image explanations that incorporate the context
in which an image appears, yet current VQA datasets focus on images in
isolation. We argue that VQA models will not fully succeed at meeting people's
needs unless they take context into account. To further motivate and analyze
the distinction between different contexts, we introduce Context-VQA, a VQA
dataset that pairs images with contexts, specifically types of websites (e.g.,
a shopping website). We find that the types of questions vary systematically
across contexts. For example, images presented in a travel context garner 2
times more "Where?" questions, and images on social media and news garner 2.8
and 1.8 times more "Who?" questions than the average. We also find that context
effects are especially important when participants can't see the image. These
results demonstrate that context affects the types of questions asked and that
VQA models should be context-sensitive to better meet people's needs,
especially in accessibility settings.

<p class="mathjax">Since the inception of SQL, nulls have frustrated database users and builders
alike. Those writing SQL must painstakingly guard their queries against
surprising results caused by nulls, while those building database engines
constantly struggle to implement the subtle semantics of 3-valued logic. Given
that the relational model already provides a way to represent missing
information, namely, with the absence of a tuple in a relation, one may step
back and ask:"Are nulls really necessary?" We answer:"No!" by proposing a new
semantics for SQL that completely eliminates nulls. Our semantics, called
Columnar Semantics, is as expressive as the standard 3-valued logic semantics,
and behaves the same when the data and query are null-free. Where the two
semantics differ, Columnar Semantics results in simpler queries. To evaluate
Columnar Semantics and any other alternative semantics or query languages, we
propose MIA (Missing Information Artifacts), a collection of queries and data
sets for handling missing information, and invite contributions from the
community.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a method for resume rating using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) and entity detection with SpaCy. The proposed method first
extracts relevant entities such as education, experience, and skills from the
resume using SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER). The LDA model then uses
these entities to rate the resume by assigning topic probabilities to each
entity. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the entity detection
using SpaCy's NER and report its evaluation metrics. Using LDA, our proposed
system breaks down resumes into latent topics and extracts meaningful semantic

<p class="mathjax">We introduce an efficient scheme for the construction of quadrature rules for
bandlimited functions. While the scheme is predominantly based on well-known
facts about prolate spheroidal wave functions of order zero, it has the
asymptotic CPU time estimate $O(n log n)$ to construct an n-point quadrature
rule. Moreover, the size of the ``$n log n$'' term in the CPU time estimate is
small, so for all practical purposes the CPU time cost is proportional to $n$.
The performance of the algorithm is illustrated by several numerical examples.

<p class="mathjax">This research focuses on the evolving dynamics of the power grid, where
traditional synchronous generators are being replaced by non-synchronous power
electronic converter (PEC)-interfaced renewable energy sources. The non-linear
dynamics must be accurately modeled to ensure the stability of future
converter-dominated power systems (CDPS). However, obtaining comprehensive
dynamic models becomes more complex and computationally intensive as the system
grows. This study proposes a scalable and automated data-driven partitioned
modeling framework for CDPS dynamics. The method constructs reduced-ordered
dynamic linear transfer function models using input-output measurements from a
PEC switching model. Validation experiments were conducted on single-house and
multi-house scenarios, demonstrating high accuracy (over 97%) and significant
computational speed improvements (6.5 times faster) compared to comprehensive
models. This framework and modeling approach offers valuable insights for
efficient analysis of power system dynamics, aiding in planning, operation, and
dispatch.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce DARSAN, a decentralized review system designed for Non-Fungible
Token (NFT) marketplaces, to address the challenge of verifying the quality of
highly resalable products with few verified buyers by incentivizing unbiased
reviews. DARSAN works by iteratively selecting a group of reviewers (called
``experts'') who are likely to both accurately predict the objective popularity
and assess some subjective quality of the assets uniquely associated with NFTs.
The system consists of a two-phased review process: a ``pre-listing'' phase
where only experts can review the product, and a ``pre-sale'' phase where any
reviewer on the system can review the product. Upon completion of the sale,
DARSAN distributes incentives to the participants and selects the next
generation of experts based on the performance of both experts and non-expert
reviewers. We evaluate DARSAN through simulation and show that, once
bootstrapped with an initial set of appropriately chosen experts, DARSAN favors
honest reviewers and improves the quality of the expert pool over time without
any external intervention even in the presence of potentially malicious
participants.

<p class="mathjax">In the face of climate change, are companies really taking substantial steps
toward more sustainable operations? A comprehensive answer lies in the dense,
information-rich landscape of corporate sustainability reports. However, the
sheer volume and complexity of these reports make human analysis very costly.
Therefore, only a few entities worldwide have the resources to analyze these
reports at scale, which leads to a lack of transparency in sustainability
reporting. Empowering stakeholders with LLM-based automatic analysis tools can
be a promising way to democratize sustainability report analysis. However,
developing such tools is challenging due to (1) the hallucination of LLMs and
(2) the inefficiency of bringing domain experts into the AI development loop.
In this paper, we ChatReport, a novel LLM-based system to automate the analysis
of corporate sustainability reports, addressing existing challenges by (1)
making the answers traceable to reduce the harm of hallucination and (2)
actively involving domain experts in the development loop. We make our
methodology, annotated datasets, and generated analyses of 1015 reports
publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the internal structure of language model computations using
causal analysis and demonstrate two motifs: (1) a form of adaptive computation
where ablations of one attention layer of a language model cause another layer
to compensate (which we term the Hydra effect) and (2) a counterbalancing
function of late MLP layers that act to downregulate the maximum-likelihood
token. Our ablation studies demonstrate that language model layers are
typically relatively loosely coupled (ablations to one layer only affect a
small number of downstream layers). Surprisingly, these effects occur even in
language models trained without any form of dropout. We analyse these effects
in the context of factual recall and consider their implications for
circuit-level attribution in language models.

<p class="mathjax">Being able to efficiently obtain an accurate estimate of the failure
probability of SRAM components has become a central issue as model circuits
shrink their scale to submicrometer with advanced technology nodes. In this
work, we revisit the classic norm minimization method. We then generalize it
with infinite components and derive the novel optimal manifold concept, which
bridges the surrogate-based and importance sampling (IS) yield estimation
methods. We then derive a sub-optimal manifold, optimal hypersphere, which
leads to an efficient sampling method being aware of the failure boundary
called onion sampling. Finally, we use a neural coupling flow (which learns
from samples like a surrogate model) as the IS proposal distribution. These
combinations give rise to a novel yield estimation method, named Optimal
Manifold Important Sampling (OPTIMIS), which keeps the advantages of the
surrogate and IS methods to deliver state-of-the-art performance with
robustness and consistency, with up to 3.5x in efficiency and 3x in accuracy
over the best of SOTA methods in High-dimensional SRAM evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Injecting textual information into knowledge graph (KG) entity
representations has been a worthwhile expedition in terms of improving
performance in KG oriented tasks within the NLP community. External knowledge
often adopted to enhance KG embeddings ranges from semantically rich lexical
dependency parsed features to a set of relevant key words to entire text
descriptions supplied from an external corpus such as wikipedia and many more.
Despite the gains this innovation (Text-enhanced KG embeddings) has made, the
proposal in this work suggests that it can be improved even further. Instead of
using a single text description (which would not sufficiently represent an
entity because of the inherent lexical ambiguity of text), we propose a
multi-task framework that jointly selects a set of text descriptions relevant
to KG entities as well as align or augment KG embeddings with text
descriptions. Different from prior work that plugs formal entity descriptions
declared in knowledge bases, this framework leverages a retriever model to
selectively identify richer or highly relevant text descriptions to use in
augmenting entities. Furthermore, the framework treats the number of
descriptions to use in augmentation process as a parameter, which allows the
flexibility of enumerating across several numbers before identifying an
appropriate number. Experiment results for Link Prediction demonstrate a 5.5%
and 3.5% percentage increase in the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@10
scores respectively, in comparison to text-enhanced knowledge graph
augmentation methods using traditional CNNs.

<p class="mathjax">We describe a new concrete approach to giving predictable error locations for
sequential (flow-sensitive) effect systems. Prior implementations of sequential
effect systems rely on either computing a bottom-up effect and comparing it to
a declaration (e.g., method annotation) or leaning on constraint-based type
inference. These approaches do not necessarily report program locations that
precisely indicate where a program may "go wrong" at runtime.
<br />Instead of relying on constraint solving, we draw on the notion of a residual
from literature on ordered algebraic structures. Applying these to effect
quantales (a large class of sequential effect systems) yields an implementation
approach which accepts exactly the same program as an original effect quantale,
but for effect-incorrect programs is guaranteed to fail type-checking with
predictable error locations tied to evaluation order. We have implemented this
idea in a generic effect system implementation framework for Java, and report
on experiences applying effect systems from the literature and novel effect
systems to Java programs. We find that the reported error locations with our
technique are significantly closer to the program points that lead to failed
effect checks.

<p class="mathjax">The paper introduces the application of information geometry to describe the
ground states of Ising models. This is achieved by utilizing parity-check
matrices of cyclic and quasi-cyclic codes on toric and spherical topologies.
The approach establishes a connection between machine learning and
error-correcting coding, specifically in terms of automorphism and the size of
the circulant of the quasi-cyclic code. This proposed approach has implications
for the development of new embedding methods based on trapping sets.
Statistical physics and number geometry are utilized to optimize
error-correcting codes, leading to these embedding and sparse factorization
methods. The paper establishes a direct connection between DNN architecture and
error-correcting coding by demonstrating how state-of-the-art DNN architectures
(ChordMixer, Mega, Mega-chunk, CDIL, ...) from the long-range arena can be
equivalent to specific types (Cage-graph, Repeat Accumulate) of block and
convolutional LDPC codes. QC codes correspond to certain types of chemical
elements, with the carbon element being represented by the mixed automorphism
Shu-Lin-Fossorier QC-LDPC code. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA) used in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model can be seen as analogous
to the back-propagation loss function landscape in training DNNs. This
similarity creates a comparable problem with TS pseudo-codeword, resembling the
belief propagation method. Additionally, the layer depth in QAOA correlates to
the number of decoding belief propagation iterations in the Wiberg decoding
tree. Overall, this work has the potential to advance multiple fields, from
Information Theory, DNN architecture design (sparse and structured prior graph
topology), efficient hardware design for Quantum and Classical DPU/TPU (graph,
quantize and shift register architect.) to Materials Science and beyond.

distinct prompting strategies: (1) basic prompting, (2) recommendation-driven
prompting, (3) engagement-guided prompting, and (4) recommendation-driven +

original content description with the augmented input text generated by LLM
using these prompting strategies leads to improved recommendation performance.
This finding highlights the importance of incorporating diverse prompts and

<p class="mathjax">We propose an unconditionally energy-stable, orthonormality-preserving,
component-wise splitting iterative scheme for the Kohn-Sham gradient flow based
model in the electronic structure calculation. We first study the scheme
discretized in time but still continuous in space. The component-wise splitting
iterative scheme changes one wave function at a time, similar to the
Gauss-Seidel iteration for solving a linear equation system. Rigorous
mathematical derivations are presented to show our proposed scheme indeed
satisfies the desired properties. We then study the fully-discretized scheme,
where the space is further approximated by a conforming finite element
subspace. For the fully-discretized scheme, not only the preservation of
orthogonality and normalization (together we called orthonormalization) can be
quickly shown using the same idea as for the semi-discretized scheme, but also
the highlight property of the scheme, i.e., the unconditional energy stability
can be rigorously proven. The scheme allows us to use large time step sizes and
deal with small systems involving only a single wave function during each
iteration step. Several numerical experiments are performed to verify the
theoretical analysis, where the number of iterations is indeed greatly reduced
as compared to similar examples solved by the Kohn-Sham gradient flow based
model in the literature.

<p class="mathjax">In societal-scale infrastructures, such as electric grids or transportation
networks, pricing mechanisms are often used as a way to shape users' demand in
order to lower operating costs and improve reliability. Existing approaches to
pricing design for safety-critical networks often require that users are
queried beforehand to negotiate prices, which has proven to be challenging to
implement in the real-world. To offer a more practical alternative, we develop
learning-based pricing mechanisms that require no input from the users. These
pricing mechanisms aim to maximize the utility of the users' consumption by
gradually estimating the users' price response over a span of $T$ time steps
(e.g., days) while ensuring that the infrastructure network's safety
constraints that limit the users' demand are satisfied at all time steps. We
propose two different algorithms for the two different scenarios when, 1) the
utility function is chosen by the central coordinator to achieve a social
objective and 2) the utility function is defined by the price response under
the assumption that the users are self-interested agents. We prove that both
algorithms enjoy $\tilde{O} (T^{2/3})$ regret with high probability. We then
apply these algorithms to demand response pricing for the smart grid and
numerically demonstrate their effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">A CF explainer identifies the minimum modifications in the input that would
alter the model's output to its complement. In other words, a CF explainer
computes the minimum modifications required to cross the model's decision
boundary. Current deep generative CF models often work with user-selected
features rather than focusing on the discriminative features of the black-box
model. Consequently, such CF examples may not necessarily lie near the decision
boundary, thereby contradicting the definition of CFs. To address this issue,
we propose in this paper a novel approach that leverages saliency maps to
generate more informative CF explanations. Source codes are available at:

<p class="mathjax">Popular accounts have characterized tech worker organizing as occupational
activism, a type of employee activism motivated by a social-mission oriented
professional identity. However, tech workers are increasingly participating in
traditional labor organizing relying on worker identity. Our article shows the
transformation from the former to the latter between 2017-2022. We find that
this shift was not the result of the recent economic downturn in the technology
industry which allowed employers to reset labor relations. Rather we suggest it
was the active and creative performance of labor organizing by workers, namely
the increase in organizing networks and expertise among tech workers.

<p class="mathjax">Meetings play a critical infrastructural role in the coordination of work. In
recent years, due to shift to hybrid and remote work, more meetings are moving
to online Computer Mediated Spaces. This has led to new problems (e.g. more
time spent in less engaging meetings) and new opportunities (e.g. automated
transcription/captioning and recap support). Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) for dialog summarization have the potential to improve the
experience of meetings by reducing individuals' meeting load and increasing the
clarity and alignment of meeting outputs. Despite this potential, they face
technological limitation due to long transcripts and inability to capture
diverse recap needs based on user's context. To address these gaps, we design,
implement and evaluate in-context a meeting recap system. We first
conceptualize two salient recap representations -- important highlights, and a
structured, hierarchical minutes view. We develop a system to operationalize
the representations with dialogue summarization as its building blocks.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the system with seven users in the
context of their work meetings. Our findings show promise in using LLM-based
dialogue summarization for meeting recap and the need for both representations
in different contexts. However, we find that LLM-based recap still lacks an
understanding of whats personally relevant to participants, can miss important
details, and mis-attributions can be detrimental to group dynamics. We identify
collaboration opportunities such as a shared recap document that a high quality
recap enables. We report on implications for designing AI systems to partner
with users to learn and improve from natural interactions to overcome the
limitations related to personal relevance and summarization quality.

<p class="mathjax">Biological agents, such as humans and animals, are capable of making
decisions out of a very large number of choices in a limited time. They can do
so because they use their prior knowledge to find a solution that is not
necessarily optimal but good enough for the given task. In this work, we study
the motion coordination of multiple drones under the above-mentioned paradigm,
Bounded Rationality (BR), to achieve cooperative motion planning tasks.
Specifically, we design a prior policy that provides useful goal-directed
navigation heuristics in familiar environments and is adaptive in unfamiliar
ones via Reinforcement Learning augmented with an environment-dependent
exploration noise. Integrating this prior policy in the game-theoretic bounded
rationality framework allows agents to quickly make decisions in a group
considering other agents' computational constraints. Our investigation assures
that agents with a well-informed prior policy increase the efficiency of the
collective decision-making capability of the group. We have conducted rigorous
experiments in simulation and in the real world to demonstrate that the ability
of informed agents to navigate to the goal safely can guide the group to
coordinate efficiently under the BR framework.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms face significant challenges when
dealing with long-horizon robot manipulation tasks in real-world environments
due to sample inefficiency and safety issues. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel framework, SEED, which leverages two approaches: reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) and primitive skill-based reinforcement
learning. Both approaches are particularly effective in addressing sparse
reward issues and the complexities involved in long-horizon tasks. By combining
them, SEED reduces the human effort required in RLHF and increases safety in
training robot manipulation with RL in real-world settings. Additionally,
parameterized skills provide a clear view of the agent's high-level intentions,
allowing humans to evaluate skill choices before they are executed. This
feature makes the training process even safer and more efficient. To evaluate
the performance of SEED, we conducted extensive experiments on five
manipulation tasks with varying levels of complexity. Our results show that
\algoName significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL algorithms in sample
efficiency and safety. In addition, SEED also exhibits a substantial reduction
of human effort compared to other RLHF methods. Further details and video
results can be found at https://seediros23.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse high-dimensional functions have arisen as a rich framework to study
the behavior of gradient-descent methods using shallow neural networks,
showcasing their ability to perform feature learning beyond linear models.
Amongst those functions, the simplest are single-index models $f(x) = \phi( x
\cdot \theta^*)$, where the labels are generated by an arbitrary non-linear
scalar link function $\phi$ applied to an unknown one-dimensional projection
$\theta^*$ of the input data. By focusing on Gaussian data, several recent
works have built a remarkable picture, where the so-called information exponent
(related to the regularity of the link function) controls the required sample
complexity. In essence, these tools exploit the stability and spherical
symmetry of Gaussian distributions. In this work, building from the framework
of \cite{arous2020online}, we explore extensions of this picture beyond the
Gaussian setting, where both stability or symmetry might be violated. Focusing
on the planted setting where $\phi$ is known, our main results establish that
Stochastic Gradient Descent can efficiently recover the unknown direction
$\theta^*$ in the high-dimensional regime, under assumptions that extend
previous works ~\cite{yehudai2020learning,wu2022learning}.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection is critical in the smart industry for preventing equipment
failure, reducing downtime, and improving safety. Internet of Things (IoT) has
enabled the collection of large volumes of data from industrial machinery,
providing a rich source of information for Anomaly Detection. However, the
volume and complexity of data generated by the Internet of Things ecosystems
make it difficult for humans to detect anomalies manually. Machine learning
(ML) algorithms can automate anomaly detection in industrial machinery by
analyzing generated data. Besides, each technique has specific strengths and
weaknesses based on the data nature and its corresponding systems. However, the
current systematic mapping studies on Anomaly Detection primarily focus on
addressing network and cybersecurity-related problems, with limited attention
given to the industrial sector. Additionally, these studies do not cover the
challenges involved in using ML for Anomaly Detection in industrial machinery
within the context of the IoT ecosystems. This paper presents a systematic
mapping study on Anomaly Detection for industrial machinery using IoT devices
and ML algorithms to address this gap. The study comprehensively evaluates 84
relevant studies spanning from 2016 to 2023, providing an extensive review of
Anomaly Detection research. Our findings identify the most commonly used
algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and sensor types. Additionally, this
review identifies application areas and points to future challenges and
research opportunities.

placed at the origin of an infinite line. The autonomous robots can travel with
maximum speed $1$. When a robot rides the bike its speed increases to $v&gt;1$,
however only exactly one robot at a time can ride the bike and the bike is
non-autonomous in that it cannot move on its own. An Exit is placed on the line
at an unknown location and at distance $d$ from the origin. The robots have
limited communication behavior; one robot is a sender (denoted by S) in that it
can send information wirelessly at any distance and receive messages only in
F2F (Face-to-Face), while the other robot is a receiver (denoted by R) in that
it can receive information wirelessly but can send information only F2F. The
bike has no communication capabilities of its own. We refer to the resulting
communication model of the ensemble of the two autonomous robots and the bike
as S/R.
<br />Our general goal is to understand the impact of the non-autonomous robot in
assisting the evacuation of the two autonomous faulty robots. Our main
contribution is to provide a new evacuation algorithm that enables both robots
to evacuate from the unknown Exit in the S/R model. We also analyze the
resulting evacuation time as a function of the bike's speed $v$ and give upper
and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of the resulting algorithm for the
entire range of possible values of $v$.

<p class="mathjax">Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLM) have
increasingly been utilized in the realm of mental well-being support. However,
the implications and outcomes associated with their usage in such a critical
field remain somewhat ambiguous and unexplored. We conducted a qualitative
analysis of 120 posts, encompassing 2917 user comments, drawn from the most
popular subreddit focused on mental health support applications powered by
large language models (u/Replika). This exploration aimed to shed light on the
advantages and potential pitfalls associated with the integration of these
sophisticated models in conversational agents intended for mental health
support. We found the app (Replika) beneficial in offering on-demand,
non-judgmental support, boosting user confidence, and aiding self-discovery.
Yet, it faced challenges in filtering harmful content, sustaining consistent
communication, remembering new information, and mitigating users'
overdependence. The stigma attached further risked isolating users socially. We
strongly assert that future researchers and designers must thoroughly evaluate
the appropriateness of employing LLMs for mental well-being support, ensuring
their responsible and effective application.

<p class="mathjax">Many advanced, image-based precision agricultural technologies for plant
breeding, field crop research, and site-specific crop management hinge on the
reliable detection and phenotyping of plants across highly variable
morphological growth stages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown
promise for image-based plant phenotyping and weed recognition, but their
ability to recognize growth stages, often with stark differences in appearance,
is uncertain. Amaranthus palmeri (Palmer amaranth) is a particularly
challenging weed plant in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) production, exhibiting
highly variable plant morphology both across growth stages over a growing
season, as well as between plants at a given growth stage due to high genetic
diversity. In this paper, we investigate eight-class growth stage recognition
of A. palmeri in cotton as a challenging model for You Only Look Once (YOLO)
architectures. We compare 26 different architecture variants from YOLO v3, v5,
v6, v6 3.0, v7, and v8 on an eight-class growth stage dataset of A. palmeri.
The highest mAP@[0.5:0.95] for recognition of all growth stage classes was
47.34% achieved by v8-X, with inter-class confusion across visually similar
growth stages. With all growth stages grouped as a single class, performance
increased, with a maximum mean average precision (mAP@[0.5:0.95]) of 67.05%
achieved by v7-Original. Single class recall of up to 81.42% was achieved by
v5-X, and precision of up to 89.72% was achieved by v8-X. Class activation maps
(CAM) were used to understand model attention on the complex dataset. Fewer
classes, grouped by visual or size features improved performance over the
ground-truth eight-class dataset. Successful growth stage detection highlights
the substantial opportunity for improving plant phenotyping and weed
recognition technologies with open-source object detection architectures.

<p class="mathjax">We study how vision-language models trained on Internet-scale data can be
incorporated directly into end-to-end robotic control to boost generalization
and enable emergent semantic reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single
end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and
enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language
data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art
vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale
vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other
approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order
to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same
format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly
into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens.
We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and
instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive
evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant
robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities
from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved
generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present
in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number
or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user
commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest
to another object). We further show that incorporating chain of thought
reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, for example
figuring out which object to pick up for use as an improvised hammer (a rock),
or which type of drink is best suited for someone who is tired (an energy
drink).

<p class="mathjax">Model checking has found a role in the engineering of reactive systems.
However, model checkers are still strongly limited by the size of the system
description they can check. Here we present a technique in which a system is
simplified prior to model checking by the application of abstraction rules. The
rules can greatly reduce the state space of a system description and help in
understanding why a system satisfies a property. We illustrate the use of the
technique on examples, including Dekker's mutual exclusion algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Unwanted camera occlusions, such as debris, dust, rain-drops, and snow, can
severely degrade the performance of computer-vision systems. Dynamic occlusions
are particularly challenging because of the continuously changing pattern.
Existing occlusion-removal methods currently use synthetic aperture imaging or
image inpainting. However, they face issues with dynamic occlusions as these
require multiple viewpoints or user-generated masks to hallucinate the
background intensity. We propose a novel approach to reconstruct the background
from a single viewpoint in the presence of dynamic occlusions. Our solution
relies for the first time on the combination of a traditional camera with an
event camera. When an occlusion moves across a background image, it causes
intensity changes that trigger events. These events provide additional
information on the relative intensity changes between foreground and background
at a high temporal resolution, enabling a truer reconstruction of the
background content. We present the first large-scale dataset consisting of
synchronized images and event sequences to evaluate our approach. We show that
our method outperforms image inpainting methods by 3dB in terms of PSNR on our
dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Time series forecasting has received a lot of attention with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) being one of the widely used models due to their ability to
handle sequential data. Prior studies of RNNs for time series forecasting yield
inconsistent results with limited insights as to why the performance varies for
different datasets. In this paper, we provide an approach to link the
characteristics of time series with the components of RNNs via the versatile
metric of distance correlation. This metric allows us to examine the
information flow through the RNN activation layers to be able to interpret and
explain their performance. We empirically show that the RNN activation layers
learn the lag structures of time series well. However, they gradually lose this
information over a span of a few consecutive layers, thereby worsening the
forecast quality for series with large lag structures. We also show that the
activation layers cannot adequately model moving average and heteroskedastic
time series processes. Last, we generate heatmaps for visual comparisons of the
activation layers for different choices of the network hyperparameters to
identify which of them affect the forecast performance. Our findings can,
therefore, aid practitioners in assessing the effectiveness of RNNs for given
time series data without actually training and evaluating the networks.

<p class="mathjax">One major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is the large amount of
steps for the RL agent needs to converge in the training process and learn the
optimal policy, especially in text-based game environments where the action
space is extensive. However, non-player characters (NPCs) sometimes hold some
key information about the game, which can potentially help to train RL agents
faster. Thus, this paper explores how to interact and converse with NPC agents
to get the key information using large language models (LLMs), as well as
incorporate this information to speed up RL agent's training using knowledge
graphs (KGs) and Story Shaping.

<p class="mathjax">A key challenge in many modern data analysis tasks is that user data are
heterogeneous. Different users may possess vastly different numbers of data
points. More importantly, it cannot be assumed that all users sample from the
same underlying distribution. This is true, for example in language data, where
different speech styles result in data heterogeneity. In this work we propose a
simple model of heterogeneous user data that allows user data to differ in both
distribution and quantity of data, and provide a method for estimating the
population-level mean while preserving user-level differential privacy. We
demonstrate asymptotic optimality of our estimator and also prove general lower
bounds on the error achievable in the setting we introduce.

<p class="mathjax">Privacy and fairness are two crucial pillars of responsible Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and trustworthy Machine Learning (ML). Each objective has
been independently studied in the literature with the aim of reducing utility
loss in achieving them. Despite the significant interest attracted from both
academia and industry, there remains an immediate demand for more in-depth
research to unravel how these two objectives can be simultaneously integrated
into ML models. As opposed to well-accepted trade-offs, i.e., privacy-utility
and fairness-utility, the interrelation between privacy and fairness is not
well-understood. While some works suggest a trade-off between the two objective
functions, there are others that demonstrate the alignment of these functions
in certain scenarios. To fill this research gap, we provide a thorough review
of privacy and fairness in ML, including supervised, unsupervised,
semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. After examining and consolidating
the literature on both objectives, we present a holistic survey on the impact
of privacy on fairness, the impact of fairness on privacy, existing
architectures, their interaction in application domains, and algorithms that
aim to achieve both objectives while minimizing the utility sacrificed.
Finally, we identify research challenges in achieving privacy and fairness
concurrently in ML, particularly focusing on large language models.

<p class="mathjax">We explore task tolerances, i.e., allowable position or rotation inaccuracy,
as an important resource to facilitate smooth and effective telemanipulation.
Task tolerances provide a robot flexibility to generate smooth and feasible
motions; however, in teleoperation, this flexibility may make the user's
control less direct. In this work, we implemented a telemanipulation system
that allows a robot to autonomously adjust its configuration within task
tolerances. We conducted a user study comparing a telemanipulation paradigm
that exploits task tolerances (functional mimicry) to a paradigm that requires
the robot to exactly mimic its human operator (exact mimicry), and assess how
the choice in paradigm shapes user experience and task performance. Our results
show that autonomous adjustments within task tolerances can lead to performance
improvements without sacrificing perceived control of the robot. Additionally,
we find that users perceive the robot to be more under control, predictable,
fluent, and trustworthy in functional mimicry than in exact mimicry.

tree with a given joint distribution, we give a new proof of an explicit
characterization of shared information. The Markov chain on a tree is shown to
possess a global Markov property based on graph separation; this property plays
a key role in our proofs. When the underlying joint distribution is not known,
we exploit the special form of this characterization to provide a multiarmed

potential impact of these technologies on the future of education, including
their ability to improve personalization, increase engagement, and provide
greater access to education. Additionally, we examine the challenges and
ethical considerations associated with Education 5.0 and propose strategies for
addressing these issues. Finally, we offer insights into future directions for
the development of Education 5.0, including the need for ongoing research,
collaboration, and innovation in the field. Overall, this paper provides a
comprehensive overview of Education 5.0, its requirements, enabling
technologies, and future directions, and highlights the potential of this new
paradigm to transform education and improve learning outcomes for students.

<p class="mathjax">Compute-in-Memory (CiM), built upon non-volatile memory (NVM) devices, is
promising for accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) owing to its in-situ
data processing capability and superior energy efficiency. Unfortunately, the
well-trained model parameters, after being mapped to NVM devices, can often
exhibit large deviations from their intended values due to device variations,
resulting in notable performance degradation in these CiM-based DNN
accelerators. There exists a long list of solutions to address this issue.
However, they mainly focus on improving the mean performance of CiM DNN
accelerators. How to guarantee the worst-case performance under the impact of
device variations, which is crucial for many safety-critical applications such
as self-driving cars, has been far less explored. In this work, we propose to
use the k-th percentile performance (KPP) to capture the realistic worst-case
performance of DNN models executing on CiM accelerators. Through a formal
analysis of the properties of KPP and the noise injection-based DNN training,
we demonstrate that injecting a novel right-censored Gaussian noise, as opposed
to the conventional Gaussian noise, significantly improves the KPP of DNNs. We
further propose an automated method to determine the optimal hyperparameters
for injecting this right-censored Gaussian noise during the training process.
Our method achieves up to a 26% improvement in KPP compared to the
state-of-the-art methods employed to enhance DNN robustness under the impact of
device variations.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we revisit the problem of product item classification for
large-scale e-commerce catalogs. The taxonomy of e-commerce catalogs consists
of thousands of genres to which are assigned items that are uploaded by
merchants on a continuous basis. The genre assignments by merchants are often
wrong but treated as ground truth labels in automatically generated training
sets, thus creating a feedback loop that leads to poorer model quality over
time. This problem of taxonomy classification becomes highly pronounced due to
the unavailability of sizable curated training sets.
<br />Under such a scenario it is common to combine multiple classifiers to combat
poor generalization performance from a single classifier. We propose an
extensible deep learning based classification model framework that benefits
from the simplicity and robustness of averaging ensembles and fusion based
classifiers. We are also able to use metadata features and low-level feature
engineering to boost classification performance. We show these improvements
against robust industry standard baseline models that employ hyperparameter
optimization.
<br />Additionally, due to continuous insertion, deletion and updates to real-world
high-volume e-commerce catalogs, assessing model performance for deployment
using A/B testing and/or manual annotation becomes a bottleneck. To this end,
we also propose a novel way to evaluate model performance using user sessions
that provides better insights in addition to traditional measures of precision
and recall.

<p class="mathjax">In recent decades, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants have
achieved unprecedented success in image synthesis. However, well-trained GANs
are under the threat of illegal steal or leakage. The prior studies on remote
ownership verification assume a black-box setting where the defender can query
the suspicious model with specific inputs, which we identify is not enough for
generation tasks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel IP protection
scheme for GANs where ownership verification can be done by checking outputs
only, without choosing the inputs (i.e., box-free setting). Specifically, we
make use of the unexploited potential of the discriminator to learn a
hypersphere that captures the unique distribution learned by the paired
generator. Extensive evaluations on two popular GAN tasks and more than 10 GAN
architectures demonstrate our proposed scheme to effectively verify the
ownership. Our proposed scheme shown to be immune to popular input-based
removal attacks and robust against other existing attacks. The source code and
models are available at

<p class="mathjax">Depression is a common mental health disorder that can cause consequential
symptoms with continuously depressed mood that leads to emotional distress. One
category of depression is Concealed Depression, where patients intentionally or
unintentionally hide their genuine emotions through exterior optimism, thereby
complicating and delaying diagnosis and treatment and leading to unexpected
suicides. In this paper, we propose to diagnose concealed depression by using
facial micro-expressions (FMEs) to detect and recognize underlying true
emotions. However, the extremely low intensity and subtle nature of FMEs make
their recognition a tough task. We propose a facial landmark-based
Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach to address the challenge, and describe a
low-cost and privacy-preserving solution that enables self-diagnosis using
portable mobile devices in a personal setting (e.g., at home). We present
results and findings that validate our method, and discuss other technical
challenges and future directions in applying such techniques to real clinical
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to allow multiple clients to
collaboratively train machine learning models on their private data. However,
training and deploying large models for broader applications is challenging in
resource-constrained environments. Fortunately, Split Federated Learning (SFL)
offers an excellent solution by alleviating the computation and communication
burden on the clients SFL often assumes labeled data for local training on
clients, however, it is not the case in practice.Prior works have adopted
semi-supervised techniques for leveraging unlabeled data in FL, but data
non-IIDness poses another challenge to ensure training efficiency. Herein, we
propose Pseudo-Clustering Semi-SFL, a novel system for training models in
scenarios where labeled data reside on the server. By introducing Clustering
Regularization, model performance under data non-IIDness can be improved.
Besides, our theoretical and experimental investigations into model convergence
reveal that the inconsistent training processes on labeled and unlabeled data
impact the effectiveness of clustering regularization. Upon this, we develop a
control algorithm for global updating frequency adaptation, which dynamically
adjusts the number of supervised training iterations to mitigate the training
inconsistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets show that
our system provides a 3.3x speed-up in training time and reduces the
communication cost by about 80.1% while reaching the target accuracy, and
achieves up to 6.9% improvement in accuracy under non-IID scenarios compared to
the state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">We study finding and listing $k$-cliques in a graph, for constant $k\geq 3$,
a fundamental problem of both theoretical and practical importance.
<br />Our main contribution is a new output-sensitive algorithm for listing
$k$-cliques in graphs, for arbitrary $k\geq 3$, coupled with lower bounds based
on standard fine-grained assumptions, showing that our algorithm's running time
is tight. Previously, the only known conditionally optimal output-sensitive
algorithms were for the case of $3$-cliques by Bj\"{o}rklund, Pagh, Vassilevska
W. and Zwick [ICALP'14].
<br />Typical inputs to subgraph isomorphism or listing problems are measured by
the number of nodes $n$ or the number of edges $m$. Our framework is very
general in that it gives $k$-clique listing algorithms whose running times are
measured in terms of the number of $\ell$-cliques $\Delta_\ell$ in the graph
for any $1\leq \ell&lt;k$. This generalizes the typical parameterization in terms
of $n$ (the number of $1$-cliques) and $m$ (the number of $2$-cliques).
<br />If the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ is $2$, and if the size of the
output, $\Delta_k$, is sufficiently large, then for every $\ell&lt;k$, the running
time of our algorithm for listing $k$-cliques is
$$\tilde{O}\left(\Delta_\ell^{\frac{2}{\ell (k -
\ell)}}\Delta_k^{1-\frac{2}{k(k-\ell)}}\right).$$ For sufficiently large
$\Delta_k$, we prove that this runtime is in fact {\em optimal} for all $1 \leq
\ell &lt; k$ under the Exact $k$-Clique hypothesis.
<br />In the special cases of $k = 4$ and $5$, our algorithm in terms of $n$ is
conditionally optimal for all values of $\Delta_k$ if $\omega = 2$. Moreover,
our framework is powerful enough to provide an improvement upon the 19-year old
runtimes for $4$ and $5$-clique detection in $m$-edge graphs, as a function of
$m$ [Eisenbrand and Grandoni, TCS'04].

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces an extended tensor decomposition (XTD) method for model
reduction. The proposed method is based on a sparse non-separated enrichment to
the conventional tensor decomposition, which is expected to improve the
approximation accuracy and the reducibility (compressibility) in highly
nonlinear and singular cases. The proposed XTD method can be a powerful tool
for solving nonlinear space-time parametric problems. The method has been
successfully applied to parametric elastic-plastic problems and real time
additive manufacturing residual stress predictions with uncertainty
quantification. Furthermore, a combined XTD-SCA (self-consistent clustering
analysis) strategy has been presented for multi-scale material modeling, which
enables real time multi-scale multi-parametric simulations. The efficiency of
the method is demonstrated with comparison to finite element analysis. The
proposed method enables a novel framework for fast manufacturing and material

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and external disturbances. DoS attacks increase
the service time on the communication network and cause additional transmission
delays, which consequently increase the risk of rear-end collisions of vehicles
in the platoon. To counter DoS attacks, we propose a resilient control scheme
that exploits polytopic overapproximations of the closed-loop dynamics under
DoS attacks. This scheme allows synthesizing robust controllers that guarantee
tracking of both the desired spacing policy and spatially varying reference
velocity for all space-varying DoS attacks satisfying a hard upper bound on the
attack duration. In addition, L2 string stability conditions are derived to
ensure that external perturbations do not grow as they propagate through the
platoon, thus ensuring the string stability. Numerical simulations illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

<p class="mathjax">This paper contributes to the growing body of research on deep learning
methods for solar flare prediction, primarily focusing on highly overlooked
near-limb flares and utilizing the attribution methods to provide a post hoc
qualitative explanation of the model's predictions. We present a solar flare
prediction model, which is trained using hourly full-disk line-of-sight
magnetogram images and employs a binary prediction mode to forecast
$\geq$M-class flares that may occur within the following 24-hour period. To
address the class imbalance, we employ a fusion of data augmentation and class
weighting techniques; and evaluate the overall performance of our model using
the true skill statistic (TSS) and Heidke skill score (HSS). Moreover, we
applied three attribution methods, namely Guided Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, Integrated Gradients, and Deep Shapley Additive
Explanations, to interpret and cross-validate our model's predictions with the
explanations. Our analysis revealed that full-disk prediction of solar flares
aligns with characteristics related to active regions (ARs). In particular, the
key findings of this study are: (1) our deep learning models achieved an
average TSS=0.51 and HSS=0.35, and the results further demonstrate a competent
capability to predict near-limb solar flares and (2) the qualitative analysis
of the model explanation indicates that our model identifies and uses features
associated with ARs in central and near-limb locations from full-disk
magnetograms to make corresponding predictions. In other words, our models
learn the shape and texture-based characteristics of flaring ARs even at
near-limb areas, which is a novel and critical capability with significant
implications for operational forecasting.

<p class="mathjax">Whole-body pose estimation localizes the human body, hand, face, and foot
keypoints in an image. This task is challenging due to multi-scale body parts,
fine-grained localization for low-resolution regions, and data scarcity.
Meanwhile, applying a highly efficient and accurate pose estimator to widely
human-centric understanding and generation tasks is urgent. In this work, we
present a two-stage pose \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{W}hole-body
\textbf{P}ose estimators, named \textbf{DWPose}, to improve their effectiveness
and efficiency. The first-stage distillation designs a weight-decay strategy
while utilizing a teacher's intermediate feature and final logits with both
visible and invisible keypoints to supervise the student from scratch. The
second stage distills the student model itself to further improve performance.
Different from the previous self-knowledge distillation, this stage finetunes
the student's head with only 20% training time as a plug-and-play training
strategy. For data limitations, we explore the UBody dataset that contains
diverse facial expressions and hand gestures for real-life applications.
Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of our proposed simple yet
effective methods. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on
COCO-WholeBody, significantly boosting the whole-body AP of RTMPose-l from
64.8% to 66.5%, even surpassing RTMPose-x teacher with 65.3% AP. We release a
series of models with different sizes, from tiny to large, for satisfying
various downstream tasks. Our codes and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">Collision-free navigation in cluttered environments with static and dynamic
obstacles is essential for many multi-robot tasks. Dynamic obstacles may also
be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other
entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic
obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning
algorithm allowing inter-robot collision and static and dynamic obstacle
avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles during
decision-making, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception
inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle
asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and
re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases
and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random
cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x
time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time
in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on
real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.

<p class="mathjax">Gradient Temporal Difference (GTD) algorithms (Sutton et al., 2008, 2009) are
the first $O(d)$ ($d$ is the number features) algorithms that have convergence
guarantees for off-policy learning with linear function approximation. Liu et
al. (2015) and Dalal et. al. (2018) proved the convergence rates of GTD, GTD2
and TDC are $O(t^{-\alpha/2})$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$. This bound is tight
(Dalal et al., 2020), and slower than $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. GTD algorithms also have
two step-size parameters, which are difficult to tune. In literature, there is
a "single-time-scale" formulation of GTD. However, this formulation still has
two step-size parameters.
<br />This paper presents a truly single-time-scale GTD algorithm for minimizing
the Norm of Expected td Update (NEU) objective, and it has only one step-size
parameter. We prove that the new algorithm, called Impression GTD, converges at
least as fast as $O(1/t)$. Furthermore, based on a generalization of the
expected smoothness (Gower et al. 2019), called $L$-$\lambda$ smoothness, we
are able to prove that the new GTD converges even faster, in fact, with a
linear rate. Our rate actually also improves Gower et al.'s result with a
tighter bound under a weaker assumption. Besides Impression GTD, we also prove
the rates of three other GTD algorithms, one by Yao and Liu (2008), another
called A-transpose-TD (Sutton et al., 2008), and a counterpart of
A-transpose-TD. The convergence rates of all the four GTD algorithms are proved
in a single generic GTD framework to which $L$-$\lambda$ smoothness applies.
Empirical results on Random walks, Boyan chain, and Baird counterexample show
that Impression GTD converges much faster than existing GTD algorithms for both
on-policy and off-policy learning problems, with well-performing step-sizes in
a big range.

<p class="mathjax">The last decade has witnessed many successes of deep learning-based models
for industry-scale recommender systems. These models are typically trained
offline in a batch manner. While being effective in capturing users' past
interactions with recommendation platforms, batch learning suffers from long
model-update latency and is vulnerable to system biases, making it hard to
adapt to distribution shift and explore new items or user interests. Although
online learning-based approaches (e.g., multi-armed bandits) have demonstrated
promising theoretical results in tackling these challenges, their practical
real-time implementation in large-scale recommender systems remains limited.
First, the scalability of online approaches in servicing a massive online
traffic while ensuring timely updates of bandit parameters poses a significant
challenge. Additionally, exploring uncertainty in recommender systems can
easily result in unfavorable user experience, highlighting the need for
devising intricate strategies that effectively balance the trade-off between
exploitation and exploration. In this paper, we introduce Online Matching: a
scalable closed-loop bandit system learning from users' direct feedback on
items in real time. We present a hybrid "offline + online" approach for
constructing this system, accompanied by a comprehensive exposition of the
end-to-end system architecture. We propose Diag-LinUCB -- a novel extension of
the LinUCB algorithm -- to enable distributed updates of bandits parameter in a
scalable and timely manner. We conduct live experiments in YouTube and show
that Online Matching is able to enhance the capabilities of fresh content
discovery and item exploration in the present platform.

<p class="mathjax">System auditing is a crucial technique for detecting APT attacks. However,
attackers may try to compromise the system auditing frameworks to conceal their
malicious activities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic
study of the super producer threat in auditing frameworks, which enables
attackers to either corrupt the auditing framework or paralyze the entire
system. We analyze that the main cause of the super producer threat is the lack
of data isolation in the centralized architecture of existing solutions. To
address this threat, we propose a novel auditing framework, NODROP, which
isolates provenance data generated by different processes with a
threadlet-based architecture design. Our evaluation demonstrates that NODROP
can ensure the integrity of the auditing frameworks while achieving an average
6.58% higher application overhead compared to vanilla Linux and 6.30% lower
application overhead compared to a state-of-the-art commercial auditing
framework, Sysdig across eight different hardware configurations.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal large models have been recognized for their advantages in various
performance and downstream tasks. The development of these models is crucial
towards achieving general artificial intelligence in the future. In this paper,
we propose a novel universal language representation learning method called
UniBriVL, which is based on Bridging-Vision-and-Language (BriVL). Universal
BriVL embeds audio, image, and text into a shared space, enabling the
realization of various multimodal applications. Our approach addresses major
challenges in robust language (both text and audio) representation learning and
effectively captures the correlation between audio and image. Additionally, we
demonstrate the qualitative evaluation of the generated images from UniBriVL,
which serves to highlight the potential of our approach in creating images from
audio. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of UniBriVL
in downstream tasks and its ability to choose appropriate images from audio.
The proposed approach has the potential for various applications such as speech
recognition, music signal processing, and captioning systems.

to solve numerically Vlasov type equations. The DG method is used for space
discretization which is combined exponential Lawson Runge-Kutta method for time
discretization to get high order accuracy in time and space. In addition to get
high order accuracy in time, the use of Lawson methods enables to overcome the

Moreover, it can be proved that a discrete Poisson equation is preserved.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel weakly supervised approach for creating maps using
free-form textual descriptions (or captions). We refer to this new line of work
of creating textual maps as zero-shot mapping. Prior works have approached
mapping tasks by developing models that predict over a fixed set of attributes
using overhead imagery. However, these models are very restrictive as they can
only solve highly specific tasks for which they were trained. Mapping text, on
the other hand, allows us to solve a large variety of mapping problems with
minimal restrictions. To achieve this, we train a contrastive learning
framework called Sat2Cap on a new large-scale dataset of paired overhead and
ground-level images. For a given location, our model predicts the expected CLIP
embedding of the ground-level scenery. Sat2Cap is also conditioned on temporal
information, enabling it to learn dynamic concepts that vary over time. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our models successfully capture
fine-grained concepts and effectively adapt to temporal variations. Our
approach does not require any text-labeled data making the training easily
scalable. The code, dataset, and models will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">The complexity of high-dimensional datasets presents significant challenges
for machine learning models, including overfitting, computational complexity,
and difficulties in interpreting results. To address these challenges, it is
essential to identify an informative subset of features that captures the
essential structure of the data. In this study, the authors propose Multi-view
Sparse Laplacian Eigenmaps (MSLE) for feature selection, which effectively
combines multiple views of the data, enforces sparsity constraints, and employs
a scalable optimization algorithm to identify a subset of features that capture
the fundamental data structure. MSLE is a graph-based approach that leverages
multiple views of the data to construct a more robust and informative
representation of high-dimensional data. The method applies sparse
eigendecomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the data, yielding a reduced
feature set. The optimization problem is solved using an iterative algorithm
alternating between updating the sparse coefficients and the Laplacian graph
matrix. The sparse coefficients are updated using a soft-thresholding operator,
while the graph Laplacian matrix is updated using the normalized graph
Laplacian. To evaluate the performance of the MSLE technique, the authors
conducted experiments on the UCI-HAR dataset, which comprises 561 features, and
reduced the feature space by 10 to 90%. Our results demonstrate that even after
reducing the feature space by 90%, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) maintains
an error rate of 2.72%. Moreover, the authors observe that the SVM exhibits an
accuracy of 96.69% with an 80% reduction in the overall feature space.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks, (DNNs, a.k.a. NNs), have been widely used in various
tasks and have been proven to be successful. However, the accompanied expensive
computing and storage costs make the deployments in resource-constrained
devices a significant concern. To solve this issue, quantization has emerged as
an effective way to reduce the costs of DNNs with little accuracy degradation
by quantizing floating-point numbers to low-width fixed-point representations.
Quantized neural networks (QNNs) have been developed, with binarized neural
networks (BNNs) restricted to binary values as a special case. Another concern
about neural networks is their vulnerability and lack of interpretability.
Despite the active research on trustworthy of DNNs, few approaches have been
proposed to QNNs. To this end, this paper presents an automata-theoretic
approach to synthesizing BNNs that meet designated properties. More
specifically, we define a temporal logic, called BLTL, as the specification
language. We show that each BLTL formula can be transformed into an automaton
on finite words. To deal with the state-explosion problem, we provide a
tableau-based approach in real implementation. For the synthesis procedure, we
utilize SMT solvers to detect the existence of a model (i.e., a BNN) in the
construction process. Notably, synthesis provides a way to determine the
hyper-parameters of the network before training.Moreover, we experimentally
evaluate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the
individual fairness and local robustness of BNNs while maintaining accuracy to
a great extent.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in the simulation of frictionally contacting elastodynamics
with the Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) model have enabled inversion and
intersection-free simulation via the application of mollified barriers,
filtered line-search, and optimization-based solvers for time integration. In
its current formulation the IPC model is constructed via a discrete constraint
model, replacing non-interpenetration constraints with barrier potentials on an
already spatially discretized domain. However, while effective, this purely
discrete formulation prohibits convergence under refinement. To enable a
convergent IPC model we reformulate IPC potentials in the continuous setting
and provide a first, convergent discretization thereof. We demonstrate and
analyze the convergence behavior of this new model and discretization on a
range of elastostatic and dynamic contact problems, and evaluate its accuracy
on both analytical benchmarks and application-driven examples.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an automata-theoretic approach for reinforcement learning (RL)
under complex spatio-temporal constraints with time windows. The problem is
formulated using a Markov decision process under a bounded temporal logic
constraint. Different from existing RL methods that can eventually learn
optimal policies satisfying such constraints, our proposed approach enforces a
desired probability of constraint satisfaction throughout learning. This is
achieved by translating the bounded temporal logic constraint into a total
automaton and avoiding "unsafe" actions based on the available prior
information regarding the transition probabilities, i.e., a pair of upper and
lower bounds for each transition probability. We provide theoretical guarantees
on the resulting probability of constraint satisfaction. We also provide
numerical results in a scenario where a robot explores the environment to
discover high-reward regions while fulfilling some periodic pick-up and
delivery tasks that are encoded as temporal logic constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Various spacecraft have sensors that repeatedly perform a prescribed scanning
maneuver, and one may want high precision. Iterative Learning Control (ILC)
records previous run tracking error, adjusts the next run command, aiming for
zero tracking error in the real world, not our model of the world. In response
to a command, feedback control systems perform a convolution sum over all
commands given since time zero, with a weighting factor getting smaller going
further back in time. ILC learns to eliminate this error through iterations in
hardware. It aims to find that command that causes the real world system to
actually follow the desired command. The topic of this paper considers the
possibility of learning to make our model of the world produce less error. This
can be done easily and quickly numerically, and the result then used as a
starting point for the ILC iterations performed in hardware. The point is to
reduce the number of hardware iteration, converging more quickly to closely
tracking the desired trajectory in the world. How to decide how many iterations
with our model to make before switching to hardware iterations is presented,
with numerical simulations performed to illustrate the approach.

<p class="mathjax">Software vulnerabilities pose significant risks to computer systems,
impacting our daily lives, productivity, and even our health. Identifying and
addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner is crucial to prevent
hacking and data breaches. Unfortunately, current vulnerability identification
methods, including classical and deep learning-based approaches, exhibit
critical drawbacks that prevent them from meeting the demands of the
contemporary software industry. To tackle these issues, we present JFinder, a
novel architecture for Java vulnerability identification that leverages quad
self-attention and pre-training mechanisms to combine structural information
and semantic representations. Experimental results demonstrate that JFinder
outperforms all baseline methods, achieving an accuracy of 0.97 on the CWE
dataset and an F1 score of 0.84 on the PROMISE dataset. Furthermore, a case
study reveals that JFinder can accurately identify four cases of
vulnerabilities after patching.

<p class="mathjax">Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting has been a popular research topic in
recent years. Recently, data-driven approaches for air quality forecasting have
garnered significant attention, owing to the availability of well-established
data collection facilities in urban areas. Fixed infrastructures, typically
deployed by national institutes or tech giants, often fall short in meeting the
requirements of diverse personalized scenarios, e.g., forecasting in areas
without any existing infrastructure. Consequently, smaller institutes or
companies with limited budgets are compelled to seek tailored solutions by
introducing more flexible infrastructures for data collection. In this paper,
we propose an expandable graph attention network (EGAT) model, which digests
data collected from existing and newly-added infrastructures, with different
spatial structures. Additionally, our proposal can be embedded into any air
quality forecasting models, to apply to the scenarios with evolving spatial
structures. The proposal is validated over real air quality data from
PurpleAir.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing volume of online reviews has made possible the development of
sentiment analysis models for determining the opinion of customers regarding
different products and services. Until now, sentiment analysis has proven to be
an effective tool for determining the overall polarity of reviews. To improve
the granularity at the aspect level for a better understanding of the service
or product, the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to first identify
aspects and then determine the user's opinion about them. The complexity of
this task lies in the fact that the same review can present multiple aspects,
each with its own polarity. Current solutions have poor performance on such
data. We address this problem by proposing ATESA-B{\AE}RT, a heterogeneous
ensemble learning model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. Firstly, we divide
our problem into two sub-tasks, i.e., Aspect Term Extraction and Aspect Term
Sentiment Analysis. Secondly, we use the \textit{argmax} multi-class
classification on six transformers-based learners for each sub-task. Initial
experiments on two datasets prove that ATESA-B{\AE}RT outperforms current
state-of-the-art solutions while solving the many aspects problem.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic Engineering (TE) is an efficient technique to balance network flows
and thus improves the performance of a hybrid Software Defined Network (SDN).
Previous TE solutions mainly leverage heuristic algorithms to centrally
optimize link weight setting or traffic splitting ratios under the static
traffic demand. Note that as the network scale becomes larger and network
management gains more complexity, it is notably that the centralized TE methods
suffer from a high computation overhead and a long reaction time to optimize
routing of flows when the network traffic demand dynamically fluctuates or
network failures happen. To enable adaptive and efficient routing in TE, we
propose a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning method CMRL that divides the
routing optimization of a large network into multiple small-scale routing
decisionmaking problems. To coordinate the multiple agents for achieving a
global optimization goal, we construct an interactive environment for training
the routing agents that own partial link utilization observations. To optimize
credit assignment of multi-agent, we introduce the difference reward assignment
mechanism for encouraging agents to take better action. Extensive simulations
conducted on the real traffic traces demonstrate the superiority of CMRL in
improving TE performance, especially when traffic demands change or network
failures happen.

<p class="mathjax">For industrial control systems (ICS), many existing defense solutions focus
on detecting attacks only when they make the system behave anomalously.
Instead, in this work, we study how to detect attackers who are still in their
hiding phase. Specifically, we consider an off-path false-data-injection
attacker who makes the original sensor's readings unavailable and then
impersonates that sensor by sending out legitimate-looking fake readings, so
that she can stay hidden in the system for a prolonged period of time (e.g., to
gain more information or to launch the actual devastating attack on a specific
time). To expose such hidden attackers, our approach relies on continuous
injection of ``micro distortion'' to the original sensor's readings, either
through digital or physical means. We keep the distortions strictly within a
small magnitude (e.g., $0.5\%$ of the possible operating value range) to ensure
that it does not affect the normal functioning of the ICS. Micro-distortions
are generated based on secret key(s) shared only between the targeted sensor
and the defender. For digitally-inserted micro-distortions, we propose and
discuss the pros and cons of a two-layer least-significant-bit-based detection
algorithm. Alternatively, when the micro-distortions are added physically, a
main design challenge is to ensure the introduced micro-distortions do not get
overwhelmed by the fluctuation of actual readings and can still provide
accurate detection capability. Towards that, we propose a simple yet effective
Filtered-$\Delta$-Mean-Difference algorithm that can expose the hidden
attackers in a highly accurate and fast manner. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of our defense by using real-world sensor reading
traces from different industrial control (including smart grid) systems.

<p class="mathjax">Terahertz (THz) communication is one of the most promising candidates to
accommodate high-speed mobile data services. This paper proposes a secure
hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) aided THz
communication scheme, where the transmission secrecy is ensured by confusing
the eavesdropper with dummy messages. The connection and secrecy outage
probabilities are then derived in closed-form. Besides, the tail behaviour of
the connection outage probability in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
examined by carrying out the asymptotic analysis, and the upper bound of the
secrecy outage probability is obtained in a simple form by capitalizing on
large deviations. With these results, we take a step further to investigate the
secrecy long term average throughput (LTAT). By noticing that HARQ-IR not only
improves the reliability of the legitimate user, but also increases the
probability of being eavesdropped, a robust rate adaption policy is finally
proposed to maximize the LTAT while restricting the connection and secrecy
outage probabilities within satisfactory requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Event-driven multi-threaded programming is an important idiom for structuring
concurrent computations. Stateless Model Checking (SMC) is an effective
verification technique for multi-threaded programs, especially when coupled
with Dynamic Partial Order Reduction (DPOR). Existing SMC techniques are often
ineffective in handling event-driven programs, since they will typically
explore all possible orderings of event processing, even when events do not
conflict. We present Event-DPOR , a DPOR algorithm tailored to event-driven
multi-threaded programs. It is based on Optimal-DPOR, an optimal DPOR algorithm
for multi-threaded programs; we show how it can be extended for event-driven
programs. We prove correctness of Event-DPOR for all programs, and optimality
for a large subclass. One complication is that an operation in Event-DPOR,
which checks for redundancy of new executions, is NP-hard, as we show in this
paper; we address this by a sequence of inexpensive (but incomplete) tests
which check for redundancy efficiently. Our implementation and experimental
evaluation show that, in comparison with other tools in which handler threads
are simulated using locks, Event-DPOR can be exponentially faster than other
state-of-the-art DPOR algorithms on a variety of programs and manages to
completely avoid unnecessary exploration of executions.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning has been greatly improved in recent studies and an
increased interest in real-world implementation has emerged in recent years. In
many cases, due to the non-static disturbances, it becomes challenging for the
agent to keep the performance. The disturbance results in the environment
called Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. In common practice,
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process is handled by introducing an
additional estimator, or Recurrent Neural Network is utilized in the context of
reinforcement learning. Both of the cases require to process sequential
information on the trajectory. However, there are only a few studies
investigating the effect of information to consider and the network structure
to handle them. This study shows the benefit of action sequence inclusion in
order to solve Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. Several structures
and approaches are proposed to extend one of the latest deep reinforcement
learning algorithms with LSTM networks. The developed algorithms showed
enhanced robustness of controller performance against different types of
external disturbances that are added to observation.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale language models such as DNABert and LOGO aim to learn optimal
gene representations and are trained on the entire Human Reference Genome.
However, standard tokenization schemes involve a simple sliding window of
tokens like k-mers that do not leverage any gene-based semantics and thus may
lead to (trivial) masking of easily predictable sequences and subsequently
inefficient Masked Language Modeling (MLM) training. Therefore, we propose a
novel masking algorithm, GeneMask, for MLM training of gene sequences, where we
randomly identify positions in a gene sequence as mask centers and locally
select the span around the mask center with the highest Normalized Pointwise
Mutual Information (NPMI) to mask. We observe that in the absence of
human-understandable semantics in the genomics domain (in contrast, semantic
units like words and phrases are inherently available in NLP), GeneMask-based
models substantially outperform the SOTA models (DNABert and LOGO) over four
benchmark gene sequence classification datasets in five few-shot settings (10
to 1000-shot). More significantly, the GeneMask-based DNABert model is trained
for less than one-tenth of the number of epochs of the original SOTA model. We
also observe a strong correlation between top-ranked PMI tokens and conserved
DNA sequence motifs, which may indicate the incorporation of latent genomic
information. The codes (including trained models) and datasets are made
publicly available at https://github.com/roysoumya/GeneMask.

<p class="mathjax">Immune repertoire classification, a typical multiple instance learning (MIL)
problem, is a frontier research topic in computational biology that makes
transformative contributions to new vaccines and immune therapies. However, the
traditional instance-space MIL, directly assigning bag-level labels to
instances, suffers from the massive amount of noisy labels and extremely low
witness rate. In this work, we propose a noisy-label-learning formulation to
solve the immune repertoire classification task. To remedy the inaccurate
supervision of repertoire-level labels for a sequence-level classifier, we
design a robust training strategy: The initial labels are smoothed to be
asymmetric and are progressively corrected using the model's predictions
throughout the training process. Furthermore, two models with the same
architecture but different parameter initialization are co-trained
simultaneously to remedy the known "confirmation bias" problem in the
self-training-like schema. As a result, we obtain accurate sequence-level
classification and, subsequently, repertoire-level classification. Experiments
on the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Cancer datasets demonstrate our method's
effectiveness and superior performance on sequence-level and repertoire-level
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">A major driver of AI products today is the fact that new skills emerge in
language models when their parameter set and training corpora are scaled up.
This phenomenon is poorly understood, and a mechanistic explanation via
mathematical analysis of gradient-based training seems difficult. The current
paper takes a different approach, analysing emergence using the famous (and
empirical) Scaling Laws of LLMs and a simple statistical framework.
Contributions include: (a) A statistical framework that relates cross-entropy
loss of LLMs to competence on the basic skills that underlie language tasks.
(b) Mathematical analysis showing that the Scaling Laws imply a strong form of
inductive bias that allows the pre-trained model to learn very efficiently. We
informally call this {\em slingshot generalization} since naively viewed it
appears to give competence levels at skills that violate usual generalization
theory. (c) A key example of slingshot generalization, that competence at
executing tasks involving $k$-tuples of skills emerges essentially at the same
scaling and same rate as competence on the elementary skills themselves.

<p class="mathjax">Predictive Autoscaling is used to forecast the workloads of servers and
prepare the resources in advance to ensure service level objectives (SLOs) in
dynamic cloud environments.However, in practice, its prediction task often
suffers from performance degradation under abnormal traffics caused by external
events (such as sales promotional activities and applications'
re-configurations), for which a common solution is to re-train the model with
data of a long historical period, but at the expense of high computational and
storage costs.To better address this problem, we propose a replay-based
continual learning method, i.e., Density-based Memory Selection and Hint-based
Network Learning Model (DMSHM), using only a small part of the historical log
to achieve accurate predictions.First, we discover the phenomenon of sample
overlap when applying replay-based continual learning in prediction tasks. In
order to surmount this challenge and effectively integrate new sample
distribution, we propose a density-based sample selection strategy that
utilizes kernel density estimation to calculate sample density as a reference
to compute sample weight, and employs weight sampling to construct a new memory
set.Then we implement hint-based network learning based on hint representation
to optimize the parameters.Finally, we conduct experiments on public and
industrial datasets to demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art continual learning methods in terms of memory capacity and
prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate remarkable practicability of
DMSHM in real industrial applications.

<p class="mathjax">Most nighttime semantic segmentation studies are based on domain adaptation
approaches and image input. However, limited by the low dynamic range of
conventional cameras, images fail to capture structural details and boundary
information in low-light conditions. Event cameras, as a new form of vision
sensors, are complementary to conventional cameras with their high dynamic
range. To this end, we propose a novel unsupervised Cross-Modality Domain
Adaptation (CMDA) framework to leverage multi-modality (Images and Events)
information for nighttime semantic segmentation, with only labels on daytime
images. In CMDA, we design the Image Motion-Extractor to extract motion
information and the Image Content-Extractor to extract content information from
images, in order to bridge the gap between different modalities (Images to
Events) and domains (Day to Night). Besides, we introduce the first image-event
nighttime semantic segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments on both the
public image dataset and the proposed image-event dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. We open-source our code, models, and
dataset at https://github.com/XiaRho/CMDA.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research has demonstrated the potential of reinforcement learning (RL)
in enabling effective multi-robot collaboration, particularly in social
dilemmas where robots face a trade-off between self-interests and collective
benefits. However, environmental factors such as miscommunication and
adversarial robots can impact cooperation, making it crucial to explore how
multi-robot communication can be manipulated to achieve different outcomes.
This paper presents a novel approach, namely PIMbot, to manipulating the reward
function in multi-robot collaboration through two distinct forms of
manipulation: policy and incentive manipulation. Our work introduces a new
angle for manipulation in recent multi-agent RL social dilemmas that utilize a
unique reward function for incentivization. By utilizing our proposed PIMbot
mechanisms, a robot is able to manipulate the social dilemma environment
effectively. PIMbot has the potential for both positive and negative impacts on
the task outcome, where positive impacts lead to faster convergence to the
global optimum and maximized rewards for any chosen robot. Conversely, negative
impacts can have a detrimental effect on the overall task performance. We
present comprehensive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed methods in the Gazebo-simulated multi-robot environment. Our
work provides insights into how inter-robot communication can be manipulated
and has implications for various robotic applications. %, including robotics,
transportation, and manufacturing.

<p class="mathjax">In a decentralized machine learning system, data is typically partitioned
among multiple devices or nodes, each of which trains a local model using its
own data. These local models are then shared and combined to create a global
model that can make accurate predictions on new data. In this paper, we start
exploring the role of the network topology connecting nodes on the performance
of a Machine Learning model trained through direct collaboration between nodes.
We investigate how different types of topologies impact the "spreading of
knowledge", i.e., the ability of nodes to incorporate in their local model the
knowledge derived by learning patterns in data available in other nodes across
the networks. Specifically, we highlight the different roles in this process of
more or less connected nodes (hubs and leaves), as well as that of macroscopic
network properties (primarily, degree distribution and modularity). Among
others, we show that, while it is known that even weak connectivity among
network components is sufficient for information spread, it may not be
sufficient for knowledge spread. More intuitively, we also find that hubs have
a more significant role than leaves in spreading knowledge, although this
manifests itself not only for heavy-tailed distributions but also when "hubs"
have only moderately more connections than leaves. Finally, we show that
tightly knit communities severely hinder knowledge spread.

<p class="mathjax">With the integration of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) into our transportation
systems, their harmonious coexistence with Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) in mixed
traffic settings becomes a crucial focus of research. A vital component of this
coexistence is the capability of AVs to mimic human-like interaction intentions
within the traffic environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework
for Unprotected left-turn trajectory planning for AVs, aiming to replicate
human driving patterns and facilitate effective communication of social intent.
Our framework comprises three stages: trajectory generation, evaluation, and
selection. In the generation stage, we use real human-driving trajectory data
to define constraints for an anticipated trajectory space, generating candidate
motion trajectories that embody intent expression. The evaluation stage employs
maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (ME-IRL) to assess human
trajectory preferences, considering factors such as traffic efficiency, driving
comfort, and interactive safety. In the selection stage, we apply a Boltzmann
distribution-based method to assign rewards and probabilities to candidate
trajectories, thereby facilitating human-like decision-making. We conduct
validation of our proposed framework using a real trajectory dataset and
perform a comparative analysis against several baseline methods. The results
demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in terms of
human-likeness, intent expression capability, and computational efficiency.

in a decentralized system for secure peer-to-peer transactions. It is gaining
much popularity over traditional methods of payments because it facilitates a
very fast, easy and secure way of transactions. However, it is very volatile
and is influenced by a range of factors, with social media being a major one.
Thus, with over four billion active users of social media, we need to
understand its influence on the crypto market and how it can lead to
fluctuations in the values of these cryptocurrencies. In our work, we analyze
the influence of activities on Twitter, in particular the sentiments of the
tweets posted regarding cryptocurrencies and how it influences their prices. In
addition, we also collect metadata related to tweets and users. We use all
these features to also predict the price of cryptocurrency for which we use
some regression-based models and an LSTM-based model.

<p class="mathjax">Despite advancements in user-guided video segmentation, extracting complex
objects consistently for highly complex scenes is still a labor-intensive task,
especially for production. It is not uncommon that a majority of frames need to
be annotated. We introduce a novel semi-supervised video object segmentation
(SSVOS) model, XMem++, that improves existing memory-based models, with a
permanent memory module. Most existing methods focus on single frame
annotations, while our approach can effectively handle multiple user-selected
frames with varying appearances of the same object or region. Our method can
extract highly consistent results while keeping the required number of frame
annotations low. We further introduce an iterative and attention-based frame
suggestion mechanism, which computes the next best frame for annotation. Our
method is real-time and does not require retraining after each user input. We
also introduce a new dataset, PUMaVOS, which covers new challenging use cases
not found in previous benchmarks. We demonstrate SOTA performance on
challenging (partial and multi-class) segmentation scenarios as well as long
videos, while ensuring significantly fewer frame annotations than any existing
method.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems are important for providing personalized services to
users, but the vast amount of collected user data has raised concerns about
privacy (e.g., sensitive data), security (e.g., malicious data) and utility
(e.g., toxic data). To address these challenges, recommendation unlearning has
emerged as a promising approach, which allows specific data and models to be
forgotten, mitigating the risks of sensitive/malicious/toxic user data.
However, existing methods often struggle to balance completeness, utility, and
efficiency, i.e., compromising one for the other, leading to suboptimal
recommendation unlearning. In this paper, we propose an Interaction and Mapping
Matrices Correction (IMCorrect) method for recommendation unlearning. Firstly,
we reveal that many collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms can be formulated
as mapping-based approach, in which the recommendation results can be obtained
by multiplying the user-item interaction matrix with a mapping matrix. Then,
IMCorrect can achieve efficient recommendation unlearning by correcting the
interaction matrix and enhance the completeness and utility by correcting the
mapping matrix, all without costly model retraining. Unlike existing methods,
IMCorrect is a whitebox model that offers greater flexibility in handling
various recommendation unlearning scenarios. Additionally, it has the unique
capability of incrementally learning from new data, which further enhances its
practicality. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the
effectiveness of IMCorrect and the results demonstrate that IMCorrect is
superior in completeness, utility, and efficiency, and is applicable in many
recommendation unlearning scenarios.

efficiently training GNNs while retaining performance. However, due to the
topology structure among nodes, graph condensation is limited to condensing
only the observed training nodes and their corresponding structure, thus
lacking the ability to effectively handle the unseen data. Consequently, the
original large graph is still required in the inference stage to perform
message passing to inductive nodes, resulting in substantial computational
demands. To overcome this issue, we propose mapping-aware graph condensation
(MCond), explicitly learning the one-to-many node mapping from original nodes
to synthetic nodes to seamlessly integrate new nodes into the synthetic graph
for inductive representation learning. This enables direct information
propagation on the synthetic graph, which is much more efficient than on the
original large graph. Specifically, MCond employs an alternating optimization
scheme with innovative loss terms from transductive and inductive perspectives,
facilitating the mutual promotion between graph condensation and node mapping
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in
inductive inference. On the Reddit dataset, MCond achieves up to 121.5x
inference speedup and 55.9x reduction in storage requirements compared with
counterparts based on the original graph.

<p class="mathjax">Densest Subgraph Problem (DSP) is an important primitive problem with a wide
range of applications, including fraud detection, community detection and DNA
motif discovery. Edge-based density is one of the most common metrics in DSP.
Although a maximum flow algorithm can exactly solve it in polynomial time, the
increasing amount of data and the high complexity of algorithms motivate
scientists to find approximation algorithms. Among these, its duality of linear
programming derives several iterative algorithms including Greedy++,
Frank-Wolfe and FISTA which redistribute edge weights to find the densest
subgraph, however, these iterative algorithms vibrate around the optimal
solution, which are not satisfactory for fast convergence. We propose our main
algorithm Locally Optimal Weight Distribution (LOWD) to distribute the
remaining edge weights in a locally optimal operation to converge to the
optimal solution monotonically. Theoretically, we show that it will reach the
optimal state of a specific linear programming which is called locally-dense
decomposition. Besides, we show that it is not necessary to consider most of
the edges in the original graph. Therefore, we develop a pruning algorithm
using a modified Counting Sort to prune graphs by removing unnecessary edges
and nodes, and then we can search the densest subgraph in a much smaller graph.

<p class="mathjax">Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security of federated
learning systems. However, existing research primarily focuses on backdoor
attacks and defenses within the generic FL scenario, where all clients
collaborate to train a single global model. \citet{qin2023revisiting} conduct
the first study of backdoor attacks in the personalized federated learning
(pFL) scenario, where each client constructs a personalized model based on its
local data. Notably, the study demonstrates that pFL methods with partial
model-sharing can significantly boost robustness against backdoor attacks. In
this paper, we whistleblow that pFL methods with partial model-sharing are
still vulnerable to backdoor attacks in the absence of any defense. We propose
three backdoor attack methods: BapFL, BapFL+, and Gen-BapFL, and we empirically
demonstrate that they can effectively attack the pFL methods. Specifically, the
key principle of BapFL lies in maintaining clean local parameters while
implanting the backdoor into the global parameters. BapFL+ generalizes the
attack success to benign clients by introducing Gaussian noise to the local
parameters. Furthermore, we assume the collaboration of malicious clients and
propose Gen-BapFL, which leverages meta-learning techniques to further enhances
attack generalization. We evaluate our proposed attack methods against two
classic pFL methods with partial model-sharing, FedPer and LG-FedAvg. Extensive
experiments on four FL benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed attack methods. Additionally, we assess the defense efficacy of
various defense strategies against our proposed attacks and find that Gradient
Norm-Clipping is particularly effective. It is crucial to note that pFL method
is not always secure in the presence of backdoor attacks, and we hope to
inspire further research on attack and defense in pFL scenarios.

against covert actuator attackers. For a non-resilient supervisor S, i.e.,
there exists at least a covert actuator attacker that is capable of inflicting
damage w.r.t S, a fortified supervisor S' satisfies two requirements: 1) S' is
resilient against any covert actuator attacker, and 2) the original
closed-behavior of the closed-loop system under S is preserved, that is, S' is
control equivalent to S. By designing a sound and complete procedure, we show
the problem of determining the existence of a fortified supervisor against
covert actuator attackers is decidable. We also discuss how to extend the
decidability result to the case against the worst-case attacker.

<p class="mathjax">Learning contrastive representations from pairwise comparisons has achieved
remarkable success in various fields, such as natural language processing,
computer vision, and information retrieval. Collaborative filtering algorithms
based on pairwise learning also rooted in this paradigm. A significant concern
is the absence of labels for negative instances in implicit feedback data,
which often results in the random selected negative instances contains false
negatives and inevitably, biased embeddings. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel correction method for sampling bias that yields a modified
loss for pairwise learning called debiased pairwise loss (DPL). The key idea
underlying DPL is to correct the biased probability estimates that result from
false negatives, thereby correcting the gradients to approximate those of fully
supervised data. The implementation of DPL only requires a small modification
of the codes. Experimental studies on five public datasets validate the
effectiveness of proposed learning method.

<p class="mathjax">Given the revolutionary role of metaverses, healthcare metaverses are
emerging as a transformative force, creating intelligent healthcare systems
that offer immersive and personalized services. The healthcare metaverses allow
for effective decision-making and data analytics for users. However, there
still exist critical challenges in building healthcare metaverses, such as the
risk of sensitive data leakage and issues with sensing data security and
freshness, as well as concerns around incentivizing data sharing. In this
paper, we first design a user-centric privacy-preserving framework based on
decentralized Federated Learning (FL) for healthcare metaverses. To further
improve the privacy protection of healthcare metaverses, a cross-chain
empowered FL framework is utilized to enhance sensing data security. This
framework utilizes a hierarchical cross-chain architecture with a main chain
and multiple subchains to perform decentralized, privacy-preserving, and secure
data training in both virtual and physical spaces. Moreover, we utilize Age of
Information (AoI) as an effective data-freshness metric and propose an
AoI-based contract theory model under Prospect Theory (PT) to motivate sensing
data sharing in a user-centric manner. This model exploits PT to better capture
the subjective utility of the service provider. Finally, our numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes for healthcare
metaverses.

to develop low-cost synthetic models, which generate images emulating the

<p class="mathjax">Imitation learning suffers from causal confusion. This phenomenon occurs when
learned policies attend to features that do not causally influence the expert
actions but are instead spuriously correlated. Causally confused agents produce
low open-loop supervised loss but poor closed-loop performance upon deployment.
We consider the problem of masking observed confounders in a disentangled
representation of the observation space. Our novel masking algorithm leverages
the usual ability to intervene in the initial system state, avoiding any
requirement involving expert querying, expert reward functions, or causal graph
specification. Under certain assumptions, we theoretically prove that this
algorithm is conservative in the sense that it does not incorrectly mask
observations that causally influence the expert; furthermore, intervening on
the initial state serves to strictly reduce excess conservatism. The masking
algorithm is applied to behavior cloning for two illustrative control systems:
CartPole and Reacher.

<p class="mathjax">Gait recognition is one of the most promising video-based biometric
technologies. The edge of silhouettes and motion are the most informative
feature and previous studies have explored them separately and achieved notable
results. However, due to occlusions and variations in viewing angles, their
gait recognition performance is often affected by the predefined spatial
segmentation strategy. Moreover, traditional temporal pooling usually neglects
distinctive temporal information in gait. To address the aforementioned issues,
we propose a novel gait recognition framework, denoted as GaitASMS, which can
effectively extract the adaptive structured spatial representations and
naturally aggregate the multi-scale temporal information. The Adaptive
Structured Representation Extraction Module (ASRE) separates the edge of
silhouettes by using the adaptive edge mask and maximizes the representation in
semantic latent space. Moreover, the Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation Module
(MSTA) achieves effective modeling of long-short-range temporal information by
temporally aggregated structure. Furthermore, we propose a new data
augmentation, denoted random mask, to enrich the sample space of long-term
occlusion and enhance the generalization of the model. Extensive experiments
conducted on two datasets demonstrate the competitive advantage of proposed
method, especially in complex scenes, i.e. BG and CL. On the CASIA-B dataset,
GaitASMS achieves the average accuracy of 93.5\% and outperforms the baseline
on rank-1 accuracies by 3.4\% and 6.3\%, respectively, in BG and CL. The
ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ASRE and MSTA.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale vision-language models (LVLMs) pretrained on massive image-text
pairs have achieved remarkable success in visual representations. However,
existing paradigms to transfer LVLMs to downstream tasks encounter two primary
challenges. Firstly, the text features remain fixed after being calculated and
cannot be adjusted according to image features, which decreases the model's
adaptability. Secondly, the model's output solely depends on the similarity
between the text and image features, leading to excessive reliance on LVLMs. To
address these two challenges, we introduce a novel two-branch model named the
Instance-Wise Adaptive Tuning and Caching (ATC). Specifically, one branch
implements our proposed ConditionNet, which guides image features to form an
adaptive textual cache that adjusts based on image features, achieving
instance-wise inference and improving the model's adaptability. The other
branch introduces the similarities between images and incorporates a learnable
visual cache, designed to decouple new and previous knowledge, allowing the
model to acquire new knowledge while preserving prior knowledge. The model's
output is jointly determined by the two branches, thus overcoming the
limitations of existing methods that rely solely on LVLMs. Additionally, our
method requires limited computing resources to tune parameters, yet outperforms
existing methods on 11 benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">360-degree video becomes increasingly popular among users. However, it is a
challenging task to serve high resolution 360-degree video to users under the
current network environment. In this paper, we propose a viewport adaptive
360-degree video streaming method based on tile priority (VATP360), which tries
to balance between the performance and the overhead. The proposed VATP360
consists of three main modules: viewport prediction, tile priority
classification and bitrate allocation. In the viewport prediction module,
object motion trajectory and predicted user's region-of-interest (ROI) are used
to achieve accurate prediction of the user's future viewport. Then, the
predicted viewport, along with the object motion trajectory, are fed into the
proposed tile priority classification algorithm to assign different priorities
to tiles, which would reduce the computational complexity of the bitrate
allocation module. Finally in the bitrate allocation stage, we adaptively
assign bitrates to tiles of different priority by reinforcement learning.
Experimental results on publicly available datasets have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

address this problem, we propose Class-Specific Distribution Alignment (CSDA),
a semi-supervised learning framework based on self-training that is suitable to
learn from highly imbalanced datasets. Specifically, we first provide a new
perspective to distribution alignment by considering the process as a change of
basis in the vector space spanned by marginal predictions, and then derive CSDA
to capture class-dependent marginal predictions on both labeled and unlabeled
data, in order to avoid the bias towards majority classes. Furthermore, we
propose a Variable Condition Queue (VCQ) module to maintain a proportionately
balanced number of unlabeled samples for each class. Experiments on three
public datasets HAM10000, CheXpert and Kvasir show that our method provides
competitive performance on semi-supervised skin disease, thoracic disease, and
endoscopic image classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Optical flow and disparity are two informative visual features for autonomous
driving perception. They have been used for a variety of applications, such as
obstacle and lane detection. The concept of "U-V-Disparity" has been widely
explored in the literature, while its counterpart in optical flow has received
relatively little attention. Traditional motion analysis algorithms estimate
optical flow by matching correspondences between two successive video frames,
which limits the full utilization of environmental information and geometric
constraints. Therefore, we propose a novel strategy to model optical flow in
the collision-free space (also referred to as drivable area or simply
freespace) for intelligent vehicles, with the full utilization of geometry
information in a 3D driving environment. We provide explicit representations of
optical flow and deduce the quadratic relationship between the optical flow
component and the vertical coordinate. Through extensive experiments on several
public datasets, we demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of our model.
Additionally, our proposed freespace optical flow model boasts a diverse array
of applications within the realm of automated driving, providing a geometric
constraint in freespace detection, vehicle localization, and more. We have made
our source code publicly available at https://mias.group/FSOF.

<p class="mathjax">Ultrasound image reconstruction can be approximately cast as a linear inverse
problem that has traditionally been solved with penalized optimization using
the $l_1$ or $l_2$ norm, or wavelet-based terms. However, such regularization
functions often struggle to balance the sparsity and the smoothness. A
promising alternative is using learned priors to make the prior knowledge
closer to reality. In this paper, we rely on learned priors under the framework
of Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM), initially conceived for
restoration tasks with natural images. We propose and test two adaptions of
DDRM to ultrasound inverse problem models, DRUS and WDRUS. Our experiments on
synthetic and PICMUS data show that from a single plane wave our method can
achieve image quality comparable to or better than DAS and state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Text detection in the wild is a well-known problem that becomes more
challenging while handling multiple scripts. In the last decade, some scripts
have gained the attention of the research community and achieved good detection
performance. However, many scripts are low-resourced for training deep
learning-based scene text detectors. It raises a critical question: Is there a
need for separate training for new scripts? It is an unexplored query in the
field of scene text detection. This paper acknowledges this problem and
proposes a solution to detect scripts not present during training. In this
work, the analysis has been performed to understand cross-script text
detection, i.e., trained on one and tested on another. We found that the
identical nature of text annotation (word-level/line-level) is crucial for
better cross-script text detection. The different nature of text annotation
between scripts degrades cross-script text detection performance. Additionally,
for unseen script detection, the proposed solution utilizes vector embedding to
map the stroke information of text corresponding to the script category. The
proposed method is validated with a well-known multi-lingual scene text dataset
under a zero-shot setting. The results show the potential of the proposed
method for unseen script detection in natural images.

<p class="mathjax">As large language models (LLMs) generate texts with increasing fluency and
realism, there is a growing need to identify the source of texts to prevent the
abuse of LLMs. Text watermarking techniques have proven reliable in
distinguishing whether a text is generated by LLMs by injecting hidden patterns
into the generated texts. However, we argue that existing watermarking methods
for LLMs are encoding-inefficient (only contain one bit of information -
whether it is generated from an LLM or not) and cannot flexibly meet the
diverse information encoding needs (such as encoding model version, generation
time, user id, etc.) in different LLMs application scenarios. In this work, we
conduct the first systematic study on the topic of Codable Text Watermarking
for LLMs (CTWL) that allows text watermarks to carry more customizable
information. First of all, we study the taxonomy of LLM watermarking technology
and give a mathematical formulation for CTWL. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation system for CTWL: (1) watermarking success rate, (2)
robustness against various corruptions, (3) coding rate of payload information,
(4) encoding and decoding efficiency, (5) impacts on the quality of the
generated text. To meet the requirements of these non-Pareto-improving metrics,
we devise a CTWL method named Balance-Marking, based on the motivation of
ensuring that available and unavailable vocabularies for encoding information
have approximately equivalent probabilities. Compared to the random vocabulary
partitioning extended from the existing work, a probability-balanced vocabulary
partition can significantly improve the quality of the generated text.
Extensive experimental results have shown that our method outperforms a direct
baseline under comprehensive evaluation.

promising approach to address the challenge of data heterogeneity. In this
paper, we address a relatively unexplored problem in federated learning. When a
federated model has been trained and deployed, and an unlabeled new client
joins, providing a personalized model for the new client becomes a highly
challenging task. To address this challenge, we extend the adaptive risk
minimization technique into the unsupervised personalized federated learning
setting and propose our method, FedTTA. We further improve FedTTA with two
simple yet effective optimization strategies: enhancing the training of the
adaptation model with proxy regularization and early-stopping the adaptation
through entropy. Moreover, we propose a knowledge distillation loss
specifically designed for FedTTA to address the device heterogeneity. Extensive
experiments on five datasets against eleven baselines demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed FedTTA and its variants. The code is available

present significant challenges for accurate object detection. The objective of
this research is to enhance object detection in ancient documents by reducing

<p class="mathjax">Expressive speech synthesis is crucial for many human-computer interaction
scenarios, such as audiobooks, podcasts, and voice assistants. Previous works
focus on predicting the style embeddings at one single scale from the
information within the current sentence. Whereas, context information in
neighboring sentences and multi-scale nature of style in human speech are
neglected, making it challenging to convert multi-sentence text into natural
and expressive speech. In this paper, we propose MSStyleTTS, a style modeling
method for expressive speech synthesis, to capture and predict styles at
different levels from a wider range of context rather than a sentence. Two
sub-modules, including multi-scale style extractor and multi-scale style
predictor, are trained together with a FastSpeech 2 based acoustic model. The
predictor is designed to explore the hierarchical context information by
considering structural relationships in context and predict style embeddings at
global-level, sentence-level and subword-level. The extractor extracts
multi-scale style embedding from the ground-truth speech and explicitly guides
the style prediction. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain audiobook
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
three baselines. In addition, we conduct the analysis of the context
information and multi-scale style representations that have never been
discussed before.

<p class="mathjax">Data visualization (DV) has become the prevailing tool in the market due to
its effectiveness into illustrating insights in vast amounts of data. To lower
the barrier of using DVs, automatic DV tasks, such as natural language question
(NLQ) to visualization translation (formally called text-to-vis), have been
investigated in the research community. However, text-to-vis assumes the NLQ to
be well-organized and expressed in a single sentence. However, in real-world
settings, complex DV is needed through consecutive exchanges between the DV
system and the users. In this paper, we propose a new task named CoVis, short
for Conversational text-to-Visualization, aiming at constructing DVs through a
series of interactions between users and the system. Since it is the task which
has not been studied in the literature, we first build a benchmark dataset
named Dial-NVBench, including dialogue sessions with a sequence of queries from
a user and responses from the system. Then, we propose a multi-modal neural
network named MMCoVisNet to answer these DV-related queries. In particular,
MMCoVisNet first fully understands the dialogue context and determines the
corresponding responses. Then, it uses adaptive decoders to provide the
appropriate replies: (i) a straightforward text decoder is used to produce
general responses, (ii) an SQL-form decoder is applied to synthesize data
querying responses, and (iii) a DV-form decoder tries to construct the
appropriate DVs. We comparatively evaluate MMCoVisNet with other baselines over
our proposed benchmark dataset. Experimental results validate that MMCoVisNet
performs better than existing baselines and achieves a state-of-the-art
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Neuro-symbolic integration aims at harnessing the power of symbolic knowledge
representation combined with the learning capabilities of deep neural networks.
In particular, Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) allow to incorporate background
knowledge in the form of logical axioms by grounding a first order logic
language as differentiable operations between real tensors. Yet, few studies
have investigated the potential benefits of this approach to improve zero-shot
learning (ZSL) classification. In this study, we present the Fuzzy Logic Visual
Network (FLVN) that formulates the task of learning a visual-semantic embedding
space within a neuro-symbolic LTN framework. FLVN incorporates prior knowledge
in the form of class hierarchies (classes and macro-classes) along with robust
high-level inductive biases. The latter allow, for instance, to handle
exceptions in class-level attributes, and to enforce similarity between images
of the same class, preventing premature overfitting to seen classes and
improving overall performance. FLVN reaches state of the art performance on the
Generalized ZSL (GZSL) benchmarks AWA2 and CUB, improving by 1.3% and 3%,
respectively. Overall, it achieves competitive performance to recent ZSL
methods with less computational overhead. FLVN is available at

<p class="mathjax">Defining test oracles is crucial and central to test development, but manual
construction of oracles is expensive. While recent neural-based automated test
oracle generation techniques have shown promise, their real-world effectiveness
remains a compelling question requiring further exploration and understanding.
This paper investigates the effectiveness of TOGA, a recently developed
neural-based method for automatic test oracle generation by Dinella et al. TOGA
utilizes EvoSuite-generated test inputs and generates both exception and
assertion oracles. In a Defects4j study, TOGA outperformed specification,
search, and neural-based techniques, detecting 57 bugs, including 30 unique
bugs not detected by other methods. To gain a deeper understanding of its
applicability in real-world settings, we conducted a series of external,
extended, and conceptual replication studies of TOGA.
<br />In a large-scale study involving 25 real-world Java systems, 223.5K test
cases, and 51K injected faults, we evaluate TOGA's ability to improve
fault-detection effectiveness relative to the state-of-the-practice and the
state-of-the-art. We find that TOGA misclassifies the type of oracle needed 24%
of the time and that when it classifies correctly around 62% of the time it is
not confident enough to generate any assertion oracle. When it does generate an
assertion oracle, more than 47% of them are false positives, and the true
positive assertions only increase fault detection by 0.3% relative to prior
work. These findings expose limitations of the state-of-the-art neural-based
oracle generation technique, provide valuable insights for improvement, and
offer lessons for evaluating future automated oracle generation methods.

<p class="mathjax">The popularity of low-voltage ac distribution networks is increasing day by
day. However, an efficient protection scheme for low-voltage ac distribution
systems is still challenging. This paper introduces a protection scheme
suitable for low-voltage grid connected and islanded ac microgrid based on
local measurements in order to locate, identify and isolate faults. Here
current decomposition method is specifically incorporated to accomplish fault
type identification. MATLAB/SIMULINK platform is chosen to examine the
performance of the proposed scheme both in grid connected and islanded
low-voltage ac microgrid. The feasibility of the protection scheme is
extensively investigated by simulating all types of faults with substantial
variations like different fault location, different fault resistances etc. The
test results ensure that the proposed protection scheme is sufficiently
reliable and faster for providing complete protection in low-voltage ac
microgrid.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach
in addressing the issues of label dependency and poor generalization
performance in traditional GNNs. However, existing self-supervised methods have
limited effectiveness on heterophilic graphs, due to the homophily assumption
that results in similar node representations for connected nodes. In this work,
we propose a multi-view contrastive learning model for heterophilic graphs,
namely, MUSE. Specifically, we construct two views to capture the information
of the ego node and its neighborhood by GNNs enhanced with contrastive
learning, respectively. Then we integrate the information from these two views
to fuse the node representations. Fusion contrast is utilized to enhance the
effectiveness of fused node representations. Further, considering that the
influence of neighboring contextual information on information fusion may vary
across different ego nodes, we employ an information fusion controller to model
the diversity of node-neighborhood similarity at both the local and global
levels. Finally, an alternating training scheme is adopted to ensure that
unsupervised node representation learning and information fusion controller can
mutually reinforce each other. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
performance of MUSE on 9 benchmark datasets. Our results show the effectiveness
of MUSE on both node classification and clustering tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating neurological disease affecting
nearly one million people in the United States. Sphingosine-1-phosphate
receptor 1, or S1PR1, is a protein target for MS. Siponimod, a ligand of S1PR1,
was approved by the FDA in 2019 for MS treatment, but there is a demonstrated
need for better therapies. To this end, we finetuned an autoencoder machine
learning model that converts chemical formulas into mathematical vectors and
generated over 500 molecular variants based on siponimod, out of which 25
compounds had higher predicted binding affinity to S1PR1. The model was able to
generate these ligands in just under one hour. Filtering these compounds led to
the discovery of six promising candidates with good drug-like properties and
ease of synthesis. Furthermore, by analyzing the binding interactions for these
ligands, we uncovered several chemical properties that contribute to high
binding affinity to S1PR1. This study demonstrates that machine learning can
accelerate the drug discovery process and reveal new insights into protein-drug
interactions.

<p class="mathjax">A key technology for the development of large language models (LLMs) involves
instruction tuning that helps align the models' responses with human
expectations to realize impressive learning abilities. Two major approaches for
instruction tuning characterize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), which are currently applied to produce the
best commercial LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT). To improve the accessibility of LLMs for
research and development efforts, various instruction-tuned open-source LLMs
have also been introduced recently, e.g., Alpaca, Vicuna, to name a few.
However, existing open-source LLMs have only been instruction-tuned for English
and a few popular languages, thus hindering their impacts and accessibility to
many other languages in the world. Among a few very recent work to explore
instruction tuning for LLMs in multiple languages, SFT has been used as the
only approach to instruction-tune LLMs for multiple languages. This has left a
significant gap for fine-tuned LLMs based on RLHF in diverse languages and
raised important questions on how RLHF can boost the performance of
multilingual instruction tuning. To overcome this issue, we present Okapi, the
first system with instruction-tuned LLMs based on RLHF for multiple languages.
Okapi introduces instruction and response-ranked data in 26 diverse languages
to facilitate the experiments and development of future multilingual LLM
research. We also present benchmark datasets to enable the evaluation of
generative LLMs in multiple languages. Our experiments demonstrate the
advantages of RLHF for multilingual instruction over SFT for different base
models and datasets. Our framework and resources are released at
\url{https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/Okapi}.

equations. We evaluate the nonlinear residual in double precision, store the
Jacobian matrix in single precision, and solve the equation for the Newton step
with iterative refinement with a factorization in half precision. We analyze
the method as an inexact Newton method. This analysis shows that, except for
very poorly conditioned Jacobians, the number of nonlinear iterations needed is
the same that one would get if one stored and factored the Jacobian in double
precision. In many ill-conditioned cases one can use the low precision
factorization as a preconditioner for a GMRES iteration. That approach can
recover fast convergence of the nonlinear iteration. We present an example to
illustrate the results.

<p class="mathjax">Position bias, the phenomenon whereby users tend to focus on higher-ranked
items of the search result list regardless of the actual relevance to queries,
is prevailing in many ranking systems. Position bias in training data biases
the ranking model, leading to increasingly unfair item rankings,
click-through-rate (CTR), and conversion rate (CVR) predictions. To jointly
mitigate position bias in both item CTR and CVR prediction, we propose two
position-bias-free CTR and CVR prediction models: Position-Aware
Click-Conversion (PACC) and PACC via Position Embedding (PACC-PE). PACC is
built upon probability decomposition and models position information as a
probability. PACC-PE utilizes neural networks to model product-specific
position information as embedding. Experiments on the E-commerce sponsored
product search dataset show that our proposed models have better ranking
effectiveness and can greatly alleviate position bias in both CTR and CVR
prediction.

<p class="mathjax">With an enormous number of hand images generated over time, unleashing pose
knowledge from unlabeled images for supervised hand mesh estimation is an
emerging yet challenging topic. To alleviate this issue, semi-supervised and
self-supervised approaches have been proposed, but they are limited by the
reliance on detection models or conventional ResNet backbones. In this paper,
inspired by the rapid progress of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in visual
classification tasks, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training strategy
for regressing 3D hand mesh parameters. Our approach involves a unified and
multi-granularity strategy that includes a pseudo keypoint alignment module in
the teacher-student framework for learning pose-aware semantic class tokens.
For patch tokens with detailed locality, we adopt a self-distillation manner
between teacher and student network based on MIM pre-training. To better fit
low-level regression tasks, we incorporate pixel reconstruction tasks for
multi-level representation learning. Additionally, we design a strong pose
estimation baseline using a simple vanilla vision Transformer (ViT) as the
backbone and attach a PyMAF head after tokens for regression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach, named HandMIM, achieves
strong performance on various hand mesh estimation tasks. Notably, HandMIM
outperforms specially optimized architectures, achieving 6.29mm and 8.00mm
PAVPE (Vertex-Point-Error) on challenging FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 test sets,
respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art records on 3D hand mesh
estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) for motion planning of multi-degree-of-freedom
robots still suffers from low efficiency in terms of slow training speed and
poor generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based robot motion
planning framework that uses implicit behavior cloning (IBC) and dynamic
movement primitive (DMP) to improve the training speed and generalizability of
an off-policy RL agent. IBC utilizes human demonstration data to leverage the
training speed of RL, and DMP serves as a heuristic model that transfers motion
planning into a simpler planning space. To support this, we also create a human
demonstration dataset using a pick-and-place experiment that can be used for
similar studies. Comparison studies in simulation reveal the advantage of the
proposed method over the conventional RL agents with faster training speed and
higher scores. A real-robot experiment indicates the applicability of the
proposed method to a simple assembly task. Our work provides a novel
perspective on using motion primitives and human demonstration to leverage the
performance of RL for robot applications.

<p class="mathjax">Several solutions ensuring the dynamic detection of malicious activities on
Android ecosystem have been proposed. These are represented by generic rules
and models that identify any purported malicious behavior. However, the
approaches adopted are far from being effective in detecting malware (listed or
not) and whose form and behavior are likely to be different depending on the
execution environment or the design of the malware itself (polymorphic for
example). An additional difficulty is added when these approaches are unable to
capture, analyze, and classify all the execution paths incorporated in the
analyzed application earlier. This suggests that the functionality of the
analyzed application can constitute a potential risk but never explored or
revealed. We have studied some malware detection techniques based on behavioral
analysis of applications. The description, characteristics, and results
obtained from each technique are presented in this article wherein we have also
highlighted some open problems, challenges as well as the different possible
future directions of research concerning behavioral analysis of malware.

<p class="mathjax">In the $L_0$ Fitting Tree Metrics problem, we are given all pairwise
distances among the elements of a set $V$ and our output is a tree metric on
$V$. The goal is to minimize the number of pairwise distance disagreements
between the input and the output. We provide an $O(1)$ approximation for $L_0$
Fitting Tree Metrics, which is asymptotically optimal as the problem is
APX-Hard.
<br />For $p\ge 1$, solutions to the related $L_p$ Fitting Tree Metrics have
typically used a reduction to $L_p$ Fitting Constrained Ultrametrics. Even
though in FOCS '22 Cohen-Addad et al. solved $L_0$ Fitting (unconstrained)
Ultrametrics within a constant approximation factor, their results did not
extend to tree metrics.
<br />We identify two possible reasons, and provide simple techniques to circumvent
them. Our framework does not modify the algorithm from Cohen-Addad et al. It
rather extends any $\rho$ approximation for $L_0$ Fitting Ultrametrics to a
$6\rho$ approximation for $L_0$ Fitting Tree Metrics in a blackbox fashion.

<p class="mathjax">We present a two-dimensional conforming virtual element method for the
fourth-order phase-field equation. Our proposed numerical approach to the
solution of this high-order phase-field (HOPF) equation relies on the design of
an arbitrary-order accurate, virtual element space with $C^1$ global
regularity. Such regularity is guaranteed by taking the values of the virtual
element functions and their full gradient at the mesh vertices as degrees of
freedom. Attaining high-order accuracy requires also edge polynomial moments of
the trace of the virtual element functions and their normal derivatives. In
this work, we detail the scheme construction, and prove its convergence by
deriving error estimates in different norms. A set of representative test cases
allows us to assess the behavior of the method.

<p class="mathjax">Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have proven to be an effective approach
for 3D human pose estimation. By naturally modeling the skeleton structure of
the human body as a graph, GCNs are able to capture the spatial relationships
between joints and learn an efficient representation of the underlying pose.
However, most GCN-based methods use a shared weight matrix, making it
challenging to accurately capture the different and complex relationships
between joints. In this paper, we introduce an iterative graph filtering
framework for 3D human pose estimation, which aims to predict the 3D joint
positions given a set of 2D joint locations in images. Our approach builds upon
the idea of iteratively solving graph filtering with Laplacian regularization
via the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. Motivated by this iterative solution, we
design a Gauss-Seidel network (GS-Net) architecture, which makes use of weight
and adjacency modulation, skip connection, and a pure convolutional block with
layer normalization. Adjacency modulation facilitates the learning of edges
that go beyond the inherent connections of body joints, resulting in an
adjusted graph structure that reflects the human skeleton, while skip
connections help maintain crucial information from the input layer's initial
features as the network depth increases. We evaluate our proposed model on two
standard benchmark datasets, and compare it with a comprehensive set of strong
baseline methods for 3D human pose estimation. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods on both
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we conduct
ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components of our
model architecture and show that the skip connection and adjacency modulation
help improve the model performance.

<p class="mathjax">Public transit systems have faced challenges and opportunities from emerging
Shared Autonomous Mobility Services (SAMS). This study addresses a city-scale
multimodal transit network design problem, with shared autonomous vehicles as
both transit feeders and a direct interzonal mode. The framework captures
spatial demand and modal characteristics, considers intermodal transfers and
express services, determines transit infrastructure investment and path flows,
and designs transit routes. A system-optimal multimodal transit network is
designed with minimum total door-to-door generalized costs of users and
operators, while satisfying existing transit origin-destination demand within a
pre-set infrastructure budget. Firstly, the geography, demand, and modes in
each clustered zone are characterized with continuous approximation. Afterward,
the decisions of network link investment and multimodal path flows in zonal
connection optimization are formulated as a minimum-cost multi-commodity
network flow (MCNF) problem and solved efficiently with a mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) solver. Subsequently, the route generation problem is solved
by expanding the MCNF formulation to minimize intramodal transfers. To
demonstrate the framework efficiency, this study uses transit demand from the
Chicago metropolitan area to redesign a multimodal transit network. The
computational results present savings in travelers' journey time and operators'
costs, demonstrating the potential benefits of collaboration between multimodal
transit systems and SAMS.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) is a novel compiler
infrastructure that aims to provide modular and extensible components to
facilitate building domain specific compilers. However, since MLIR models
programs at an intermediate level of abstraction, and most extant frontends are
at a very high level of abstraction, the semantics and mechanics of the
fundamental transformations available in MLIR are difficult to investigate and
employ in and of themselves. To address these challenges, we have developed
\texttt{nelli}, a lightweight, Python-embedded, domain-specific, language for
generating MLIR code. \texttt{nelli} leverages existing MLIR infrastructure to
develop Pythonic syntax and semantics for various MLIR features. We describe
\texttt{nelli}'s design goals, discuss key details of our implementation, and
demonstrate how \texttt{nelli} enables easily defining and lowering compute
kernels to diverse hardware platforms.

<p class="mathjax">Social platforms have emerged as a crucial platform for disseminating and
discussing information about real-life events, which offers an excellent
opportunity for early detection of newsworthy events. However, most existing
approaches for event detection solely exploit keyword burstiness or network
structures to detect hot events. Thus, they often fail to identify emerging
social events before reaching a trending state regarding the challenging nature
of events and social data. Social data, e.g., tweets, is characterized by
misspellings, incompleteness, ambiguity, and irregular language, as well as
variation in aspects of opinions. Moreover, learning the evolving
characteristics of the events utilizing limited contextual knowledge is almost
infeasible for machine learning models. To address these problems, in this
paper, we propose a framework that exploits the lexical, semantic, and
contextual representations of streaming social data. In particular, we leverage
contextual knowledge to detect semantically related tweets in their earliest
emergence and enhance the quality of produced clusters. We next produce a
cluster chains for each event to show the evolving variation of the event
through time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our framework,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting and
distinguishing social events.

<p class="mathjax">Recent neural news recommenders (NNR) extend content-based recommendation by
(1) aligning additional aspects such as topic or sentiment between the
candidate news and user history or (2) diversifying recommendations w.r.t.
these aspects. This customization is achieved by ``hardcoding'' additional
constraints into NNR's architecture and/or training objectives: any change in
the desired recommendation behavior thus requires the model to be retrained
with a modified objective, impeding wide adoption of multi-aspect news
recommenders. In this work, we introduce MANNeR, a modular framework for
flexible multi-aspect (neural) news recommendation that supports ad-hoc
customization over individual aspects at inference time. With metric-based
learning at its core, MANNeR obtains aspect-specialized news encoders and then
flexibly combines aspect-specific similarity scores for final ranking.
Evaluation on two standard news recommendation benchmarks (one in English, one
in Norwegian) shows that MANNeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs
on both standard content-based recommendation and single- and multi-aspect
customization. Moreover, with MANNeR we can trivially scale the importance and
find the optimal trade-off between content-based recommendation performance and
aspect-based diversity of recommendations. Finally, we show that both MANNeR's
content-based recommendation and aspect customization are robust to domain- and
language transfer.

<p class="mathjax">Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning
representations for graph-structured data. However, GNNs still face challenges
in modeling complex phenomena that involve advection. In this paper, we propose
a novel GNN architecture based on Advection-Diffusion-Reaction systems, called
ADR-GNN. Advection models the directed transportation of information, diffusion
captures the local smoothing of information, and reaction represents the
non-linear transformation of information in channels. We provide an analysis of
the qualitative behavior of ADR-GNN, that shows the benefit of combining
advection, diffusion, and reaction. To demonstrate its efficacy, we evaluate
ADR-GNN on real-world node classification and spatio-temporal datasets, and
show that it improves or offers competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art networks.

<p class="mathjax">The joint uplink/downlink (JUD) design of simultaneously transmitting and
reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) is conceived in
support of both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users. Furthermore, the dual
STAR-RISs (D-STAR) concept is conceived as a promising architecture for
360-degree full-plane service coverage including users located between the base
station (BS) and the D-STAR and beyond. The corresponding regions are termed as
primary (P) and secondary (S) regions. The primary STAR-RIS (STAR-P) plays an
important role in terms of tackling the P-region inter-user interference, the
self-interference (SI) from the BS and from the reflective as well as
refractive UL users imposed on the DL receiver. By contrast, the secondary
STAR-RIS (STAR-S) aims for mitigating the S-region interferences. The
non-linear and non-convex rate-maximization problem formulated is solved by
alternating optimization amongst the decomposed convex sub-problems of the BS
beamformer, and the D-STAR amplitude as well as phase shift configurations. We
also propose a D-STAR based active beamforming and passive STAR-RIS
amplitude/phase (DBAP) optimization scheme to solve the respective sub-problems
by Lagrange dual with Dinkelbach transformation, alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) with successive convex approximation (SCA), and penalty
convex-concave procedure (PCCP). Our simulation results reveal that the
proposed D-STAR architecture outperforms the conventional single RIS, single
STAR-RIS, and half-duplex networks. The proposed DBAP in D-STAR outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions in the open literature.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial attacks are usually expressed in terms of a gradient-based
operation on the input data and model, this results in heavy computations every
time an attack is generated. In this work, we solidify the idea of representing
adversarial attacks as a trainable function, without further gradient
computation. We first motivate that the theoretical best attacks, under proper
conditions, can be represented as smooth piece-wise functions (piece-wise
H\"older functions). Then we obtain an approximation result of such functions
by a neural network. Subsequently, we emulate the ideal attack process by a
neural network and reduce the adversarial training to a mathematical game
between an attack network and a training model (a defense network). We also
obtain convergence rates of adversarial loss in terms of the sample size $n$
for adversarial training in such a setting.

<p class="mathjax">Floods are one of the most common and impactful natural disasters, with a
disproportionate impact in developing countries that often lack dense
streamflow monitoring networks. Accurate and timely warnings are critical for
mitigating flood risks, but accurate hydrological simulation models typically
must be calibrated to long data records in each watershed where they are
applied. We developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to predict extreme
hydrological events at timescales up to 7 days in advance. This model
significantly outperforms current state of the art global hydrology models (the
Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Awareness System) across
all continents, lead times, and return periods. AI is especially effective at
forecasting in ungauged basins, which is important because only a few percent
of the world's watersheds have stream gauges, with a disproportionate number of
ungauged basins in developing countries that are especially vulnerable to the
human impacts of flooding. We produce forecasts of extreme events in South
America and Africa that achieve reliability approaching the current state of
the art in Europe and North America, and we achieve reliability at between 4
and 6-day lead times that are similar to current state of the art nowcasts
(0-day lead time). Additionally, we achieve accuracies over 10-year return
period events that are similar to current accuracies over 2-year return period
events, meaning that AI can provide warnings earlier and over larger and more
impactful events. The model that we develop in this paper has been incorporated
into an operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free
and open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work using AI and
open data highlights a need for increasing the availability of hydrological
data to continue to improve global access to reliable flood warnings.

<p class="mathjax">Polynomial regression is widely used and can help to express nonlinear
patterns. However, considering very high polynomial orders may lead to
overfitting and poor extrapolation ability for unseen data. The paper presents
a method for constructing a high-order polynomial regression based on the
Taylor map factorization. This method naturally implements multi-target
regression and can capture internal relationships between targets.
Additionally, we introduce an approach for model interpretation in the form of
systems of differential equations. By benchmarking on UCI open access datasets,
Feynman symbolic regression datasets, and Friedman-1 datasets, we demonstrate
that the proposed method performs comparable to the state-of-the-art regression
methods and outperforms them on specific tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting human motion plays a crucial role in ensuring a safe and effective
human-robot close collaboration in intelligent remanufacturing systems of the
future. Existing works can be categorized into two groups: those focusing on
accuracy, predicting a single future motion, and those generating diverse
predictions based on observations. The former group fails to address the
uncertainty and multi-modal nature of human motion, while the latter group
often produces motion sequences that deviate too far from the ground truth or
become unrealistic within historical contexts. To tackle these issues, we
propose TransFusion, an innovative and practical diffusion-based model for 3D
human motion prediction which can generate samples that are more likely to
happen while maintaining a certain level of diversity. Our model leverages
Transformer as the backbone with long skip connections between shallow and deep
layers. Additionally, we employ the discrete cosine transform to model motion
sequences in the frequency space, thereby improving performance. In contrast to
prior diffusion-based models that utilize extra modules like cross-attention
and adaptive layer normalization to condition the prediction on past observed
motion, we treat all inputs, including conditions, as tokens to create a more
lightweight model compared to existing approaches. Extensive experimental
studies are conducted on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of
our human motion prediction model.

<p class="mathjax">The new generation of wireless communication technology is expected to solve
the reliability problem of communication in high-speed mobile communication
scenarios. An orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system has been proposed
and can effectively solve this problem. However, the pilot overhead and
multiuser multiplexing overhead of the OTFS are relatively high. Therefore, a
new modulation technology based on the discrete affine Fourier transform was
proposed recently to address the above issues in OTFS, referred to the affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). The AFDM attains full diversity due to
parameter adjustment according to the delay-Doppler profile of the channel and
can achieve performance similar to the OTFS. Due to the limited research on the
detection of AFDM currently, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient message
passing (MP) algorithm for joint interference cancellation and detection, which
takes advantage of the inherent channel sparsity. According to simulation
results, the MP detection performs better than the minimum mean square error
and maximal ratio combining detection.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Augmented Math, a machine learning-based approach to authoring
AR explorable explanations by augmenting static math textbooks without
programming. To augment a static document, our system first extracts
mathematical formulas and figures from a given document using optical character
recognition (OCR) and computer vision. By binding and manipulating these
extracted contents, the user can see the interactive animation overlaid onto
the document through mobile AR interfaces. This empowers non-technical users,
such as teachers or students, to transform existing math textbooks and handouts
into on-demand and personalized explorable explanations. To design our system,
we first analyzed existing explorable math explanations to identify common
design strategies. Based on the findings, we developed a set of augmentation
techniques that can be automatically generated based on the extracted content,
which are 1) dynamic values, 2) interactive figures, 3) relationship
highlights, 4) concrete examples, and 5) step-by-step hints. To evaluate our
system, we conduct two user studies: preliminary user testing and expert

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces HoloBots, a mixed reality remote collaboration system
that augments holographic telepresence with synchronized mobile robots. Beyond
existing mixed reality telepresence, HoloBots lets remote users not only be
visually and spatially present, but also physically engage with local users and
their environment. HoloBots allows the users to touch, grasp, manipulate, and
interact with the remote physical environment as if they were co-located in the
same shared space. We achieve this by synchronizing holographic user motion
(Hololens 2 and Azure Kinect) with tabletop mobile robots (Sony Toio). Beyond
the existing physical telepresence, HoloBots contributes to an exploration of
broader design space, such as object actuation, virtual hand physicalization,
world-in-miniature exploration, shared tangible interfaces, embodied guidance,
and haptic communication. We evaluate our system with twelve participants by
comparing it with hologram-only and robot-only conditions. Both quantitative
and qualitative results confirm that our system significantly enhances the
level of co-presence and shared experience, compared to the other conditions.

<p class="mathjax">The knobs of modern database management systems have significant impact on
the performance of the systems. With the development of cloud databases, an
estimation service for knobs is urgently needed to improve the performance of
database. Unfortunately, few attentions have been paid to estimate the
performance of certain knob configurations. To fill this gap, we propose IWEK,
an interpretable &amp; transferable what-if estimator for database knobs. To
achieve interpretable estimation, we propose linear estimator based on the
random forest for database knobs for the explicit and trustable evaluation
results. Due to its interpretability, our estimator capture the direct
relationships between knob configuration and its performance, to guarantee the
high availability of database. We design a two-stage transfer algorithm to
leverage historical experiences to efficiently build the knob estimator for new
scenarios. Due to its lightweight design, our method can largely reduce the
overhead of collecting training data and could achieve cold start knob
estimation for new scenarios. Extensive experiments on YCSB and TPCC show that
our method performs well in interpretable and transferable knob estimation with
limited training data. Further, our method could achieve efficient estimator
transfer with only 10 samples in TPCC and YSCB.

To address this limitation, we explore both expressive and improvisational AR
sketched animation by introducing a set of responsive scribble animation
techniques that can be directly embedded through sketching interactions: 1)
object binding, 2) flip-book animation, 3) action trigger, 4) particle effects,
5) motion trajectory, and 6) contour highlight. These six animation effects
were derived from the analysis of 172 existing video-edited scribble
animations. We showcase these techniques through various applications, such as
video creation, augmented education, storytelling, and AR prototyping. The
results of our user study and expert interviews confirm that our tool can lower
the barrier to creating AR-based sketched animation, while allowing creative,
expressive, and improvisational AR sketching experiences.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving technology is poised to transform transportation systems.
However, achieving safe and accurate multi-task decision-making in complex
scenarios, such as unsignalized intersections, remains a challenge for
autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel approach to this issue with
the development of a Multi-Task Decision-Making Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (MTD-GPT) model. Leveraging the inherent strengths of reinforcement
learning (RL) and the sophisticated sequence modeling capabilities of the
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), the MTD-GPT model is designed to
simultaneously manage multiple driving tasks, such as left turns,
straight-ahead driving, and right turns at unsignalized intersections. We
initially train a single-task RL expert model, sample expert data in the
environment, and subsequently utilize a mixed multi-task dataset for offline
GPT training. This approach abstracts the multi-task decision-making problem in
autonomous driving as a sequence modeling task. The MTD-GPT model is trained
and evaluated across several decision-making tasks, demonstrating performance
that is either superior or comparable to that of state-of-the-art single-task
decision-making models.

<p class="mathjax">Combining the strengths of model-based iterative algorithms and data-driven
deep learning solutions, deep unrolling networks (DuNets) have become a popular
tool to solve inverse imaging problems. While DuNets have been successfully
applied to many linear inverse problems, nonlinear problems tend to impair the
performance of the method. Inspired by momentum acceleration techniques that
are often used in optimization algorithms, we propose a recurrent momentum
acceleration (RMA) framework that uses a long short-term memory recurrent
neural network (LSTM-RNN) to simulate the momentum acceleration process. The
RMA module leverages the ability of the LSTM-RNN to learn and retain knowledge
from the previous gradients. We apply RMA to two popular DuNets -- the learned
proximal gradient descent (LPGD) and the learned primal-dual (LPD) methods,
resulting in LPGD-RMA and LPD-RMA respectively. We provide experimental results
on two nonlinear inverse problems: a nonlinear deconvolution problem, and an
electrical impedance tomography problem with limited boundary measurements. In
the first experiment we have observed that the improvement due to RMA largely
increases with respect to the nonlinearity of the problem. The results of the
second example further demonstrate that the RMA schemes can significantly
improve the performance of DuNets in strongly ill-posed problems.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal fusion has shown initial promising results for object detection
of autonomous driving perception. However, many existing fusion schemes do not
consider the quality of each fusion input and may suffer from adverse
conditions on one or more sensors. While predictive uncertainty has been
applied to characterize single-modal object detection performance at run time,
incorporating uncertainties into the multi-modal fusion still lacks effective
solutions due primarily to the uncertainty's cross-modal incomparability and
distinct sensitivities to various adverse conditions. To fill this gap, this
paper proposes Uncertainty-Encoded Mixture-of-Experts (UMoE) that explicitly
incorporates single-modal uncertainties into LiDAR-camera fusion. UMoE uses
individual expert network to process each sensor's detection result together
with encoded uncertainty. Then, the expert networks' outputs are analyzed by a
gating network to determine the fusion weights. The proposed UMoE module can be
integrated into any proposal fusion pipeline. Evaluation shows that UMoE
achieves a maximum of 10.67%, 3.17%, and 5.40% performance gain compared with
the state-of-the-art proposal-level multi-modal object detectors under extreme
weather, adversarial, and blinding attack scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">In heterogeneous SoCs, accelerators like integrated GPUs (iGPUs) are
integrated on the same chip as CPUs, sharing the memory subsystem. In such
systems, the massive memory requests from throughput-oriented accelerators
significantly interfere with CPU memory requests. In addition to the large
performance impact, this interference provides an attacker with a strong
leakage vector for covert attacks across the processors, which is hard to
achieve across the cores in a multi-core CPU. In this paper, we demonstrate
that parallel memory write requests of the iGPU and more specifically, the
management policy of the write buffer in the memory controller (MC) can lead to
significantly stalling CPU memory read requests in heterogeneous SoCs. We
characterize the slowdown on the shared read and write buffers in the memory
controller and exploit it to build a cross-processor covert channel in
Intel-based integrated CPU-GPU systems. We develop two attack variants that
achieve a bandwidth of 1.65 kbps and 4.41 kbps and error rates of 0.49% and
4.32% respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Based on powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), recent generative Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained prominence as a pivotal research
area, exhibiting remarkable capability for both comprehension and generation.
In this work, we address the evaluation of generative comprehension in MLLMs as
a preliminary step towards a comprehensive assessment of generative models, by
introducing a benchmark named SEED-Bench. SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple
choice questions with accurate human annotations (x 6 larger than existing
benchmarks), which spans 12 evaluation dimensions including the comprehension
of both the image and video modality. We develop an advanced pipeline for
generating multiple-choice questions that target specific evaluation
dimensions, integrating both automatic filtering and manual verification
processes. Multiple-choice questions with groundtruth options derived from
human annotation enables an objective and efficient assessment of model
performance, eliminating the need for human or GPT intervention during
evaluation. We further evaluate the performance of 18 models across all 12
dimensions, covering both the spatial and temporal understanding. By revealing
the limitations of existing MLLMs through evaluation results, we aim for
SEED-Bench to provide insights for motivating future research. We will launch
and consistently maintain a leaderboard to provide a platform for the community
to assess and investigate model capability.

<p class="mathjax">Following a leading vehicle is a daily but challenging task because it
requires adapting to various traffic conditions and the leading vehicle's
behaviors. However, the question `Does the following vehicle always actively
react to the leading vehicle?' remains open. To seek the answer, we propose a
novel metric to quantify the interaction intensity within the car-following
pairs. The quantified interaction intensity enables us to recognize interactive
and non-interactive car-following scenarios and derive corresponding policies
for each scenario. Then, we develop an interaction-aware switching control
framework with interactive and non-interactive policies, achieving a
human-level car-following performance. The extensive simulations demonstrate
that our interaction-aware switching control framework achieves improved
control performance and data efficiency compared to the unified control
strategies. Moreover, the experimental results reveal that human drivers would
not always keep reacting to their leading vehicle but occasionally take
safety-critical or intentional actions -- interaction matters but not always.

<p class="mathjax">In modern dialogue systems, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has grown
exponentially due to their capacity to generate diverse, relevant, and creative
responses. Despite their strengths, striking a balance between the LLMs'
creativity and their faithfulness to external knowledge remains a key
challenge. This paper presents an innovative user-controllable mechanism that
modulates the balance between an LLM's imaginative capabilities and its
adherence to factual information. Our approach incorporates a numerical tag
during the fine-tuning phase of the LLM's training, representing the degree of
faithfulness to the reference knowledge in the generated responses. This degree
is computed through an automated process that measures lexical overlap using
ROUGE scores, semantic similarity using Sentence-BERT embeddings, and an LLM's
self-evaluation score. During model inference, users can manipulate this
numerical tag, thus controlling the degree of the LLM's reliance on external
knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments across various scenarios,
demonstrating the adaptability of our method and its efficacy in ensuring the
quality and accuracy of the LLM's responses. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to enhance the versatility of LLMs while maintaining
a balance between creativity and hallucination.

<p class="mathjax">Deep models have achieved significant process on single image
super-resolution (SISR) tasks, in particular large models with large kernel
($3\times3$ or more). However, the heavy computational footprint of such models
prevents their deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments.
Conversely, $1\times1$ convolutions bring substantial computational efficiency,
but struggle with aggregating local spatial representations, an essential
capability to SISR models. In response to this dichotomy, we propose to
harmonize the merits of both $3\times3$ and $1\times1$ kernels, and exploit a
great potential for lightweight SISR tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple
yet effective fully $1\times1$ convolutional network, named Shift-Conv-based
Network (SCNet). By incorporating a parameter-free spatial-shift operation, it
equips the fully $1\times1$ convolutional network with powerful representation
capability while impressive computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SCNets, despite its fully $1\times1$ convolutional structure,
consistently matches or even surpasses the performance of existing lightweight
SR models that employ regular convolutions.

<p class="mathjax">Video frame interpolation has been actively studied with the development of
convolutional neural networks. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of
kernel weight sharing in convolution, the interpolated frame generated by it
may lose details. In contrast, the attention mechanism in Transformer can
better distinguish the contribution of each pixel, and it can also capture
long-range pixel dependencies, which provides great potential for video
interpolation. Nevertheless, the original Transformer is commonly used for 2D
images; how to develop a Transformer-based framework with consideration of
temporal self-attention for video frame interpolation remains an open issue. In
this paper, we propose Video Frame Interpolation Flow Transformer to
incorporate motion dynamics from optical flows into the self-attention
mechanism. Specifically, we design a Flow Transformer Block that calculates the
temporal self-attention in a matched local area with the guidance of flow,
making our framework suitable for interpolating frames with large motion while
maintaining reasonably low complexity. In addition, we construct a multi-scale
architecture to account for multi-scale motion, further improving the overall
performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed method can generate interpolated frames with better visual quality
than state-of-the-art methods.

interconnected challenges in smart grid systems. Addressing these issues
collectively is crucial for ensuring system security. This paper addresses the
interconnected challenges of ETD and ECF in smart grid systems. The proposed
solution combines long short-term memory (LSTM) and a denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate input reconstruction and forecasting. By
leveraging the reconstruction and forecasting errors, the system identifies
instances of energy theft, with the methods based on reconstruction error and
forecasting error complementing each other in detecting different types of

the proposed scheme outperforms baseline methods in ETD and ECF problems. The
ensemble method significantly enhances ETD performance, accurately detecting

a comprehensive and effective solution for addressing ETD and ECF challenges,

disentangled latent space that allows attribute-based image manipulation at
latent level. As most inversion methods build upon Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), we transfer a hierarchical vision Transformer backbone
innovatively to predict $\mathcal{W^+}$ latent codes at token level. We further
apply a Style-driven Multi-scale Adaptive Refinement Transformer (SMART) in
$\mathcal{F}$ space to refine the intermediate style features of the generator.
By treating style features as queries to retrieve lost identity information
from the encoder's feature maps, SMART can not only produce high-quality
inverted images but also surprisingly adapt to editing tasks. We then prove
that StylePrompter lies in a more disentangled $\mathcal{W^+}$ and show the
controllability of SMART. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that StylePrompter can achieve desirable performance in balancing
reconstruction quality and editability, and is "smart" enough to fit into most
edits, outperforming other $\mathcal{F}$-involved inversion methods.

<p class="mathjax">Although distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely examined
in the past few years, very few studies investigate the validity of the
obtained Q-function estimator in the distributional setting. To fully
understand how the approximation errors of the Q-function affect the whole
training process, we do some error analysis and theoretically show how to
reduce both the bias and the variance of the error terms. With this new
understanding, we construct a new estimator \emph{Quantiled Expansion Mean}
(QEM) and introduce a new DRL algorithm (QEMRL) from the statistical
perspective. We extensively evaluate our QEMRL algorithm on a variety of Atari
and Mujoco benchmark tasks and demonstrate that QEMRL achieves significant
improvement over baseline algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and
convergence performance.

accomplishing a task assuming that the map of the environment is known in
advance. To do so, capabilities of the robots are listed and the environments
where they can be used are mapped. There are five robots that included for
doing the tasks. They are the robotic lizard, half-humanoid, robotic snake,
biped and quadruped. Each of these robots are capable of performing certain
activities and also they have their own limitations. The process of considering
the robot performances and acting based on their limitations is the focus of

<p class="mathjax">2D forward-looking sonar is a crucial sensor for underwater robotic
perception. A well-known problem in this field is estimating missing
information in the elevation direction during sonar imaging. There are demands
to estimate 3D information per image for 3D mapping and robot navigation during
fly-through missions. Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated their
strengths, but there are still drawbacks. Supervised learning methods have
achieved high-quality results but may require further efforts to acquire 3D
ground-truth labels. The existing self-supervised method requires pretraining
using synthetic images with 3D supervision. This study aims to realize stable
self-supervised learning of elevation angle estimation without pretraining
using synthetic images. Failures during self-supervised learning may be caused
by motion degeneracy problems. We first analyze the motion field of 2D
forward-looking sonar, which is related to the main supervision signal. We
utilize a modern learning framework and prove that if the training dataset is
built with effective motions, the network can be trained in a self-supervised
manner without the knowledge of synthetic data. Both simulation and real
experiments validate the proposed method.

zero-shot VST systems still lack the ability to transfer the voice style of a
novel speaker. In this paper, we present HierVST, a hierarchical adaptive
end-to-end zero-shot VST model. Without any text transcripts, we only use the
speech dataset to train the model by utilizing hierarchical variational
inference and self-supervised representation. In addition, we adopt a
hierarchical adaptive generator that generates the pitch representation and
waveform audio sequentially. Moreover, we utilize unconditional generation to
improve the speaker-relative acoustic capacity in the acoustic representation.
With a hierarchical adaptive structure, the model can adapt to a novel voice
style and convert speech progressively. The experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms other VST models in zero-shot VST scenarios. Audio

<p class="mathjax">For the performance modeling of power converters, the mainstream approaches
are essentially knowledge-based, suffering from heavy manpower burden and low
modeling accuracy. Recent emerging data-driven techniques greatly relieve human
reliance by automatic modeling from simulation data. However, model discrepancy
may occur due to unmodeled parasitics, deficient thermal and magnetic models,
unpredictable ambient conditions, etc. These inaccurate data-driven models
based on pure simulation cannot represent the practical performance in physical
world, hindering their applications in power converter modeling. To alleviate
model discrepancy and improve accuracy in practice, this paper proposes a novel
data-driven modeling with experimental augmentation (D2EA), leveraging both
simulation data and experimental data. In D2EA, simulation data aims to
establish basic functional landscape, and experimental data focuses on matching
actual performance in real world. The D2EA approach is instantiated for the
efficiency optimization of a hybrid modulation for neutral-point-clamped
dual-active-bridge (NPC-DAB) converter. The proposed D2EA approach realizes
99.92% efficiency modeling accuracy, and its feasibility is comprehensively
validated in 2-kW hardware experiments, where the peak efficiency of 98.45% is
attained. Overall, D2EA is data-light and can achieve highly accurate and
highly practical data-driven models in one shot, and it is scalable to other
applications, effortlessly.

<p class="mathjax">We present InvVis, a new approach for invertible visualization, which is
reconstructing or further modifying a visualization from an image. InvVis
allows the embedding of a significant amount of data, such as chart data, chart
information, source code, etc., into visualization images. The encoded image is
perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. We propose a new method
to efficiently express chart data in the form of images, enabling
large-capacity data embedding. We also outline a model based on the invertible
neural network to achieve high-quality data concealing and revealing. We
explore and implement a variety of application scenarios of InvVis.
Additionally, we conduct a series of evaluation experiments to assess our
method from multiple perspectives, including data embedding quality, data
restoration accuracy, data encoding capacity, etc. The result of our
experiments demonstrates the great potential of InvVis in invertible
visualization.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel update of a nominal stabilizing static
output feedback (SOF) controller for a perturbed linear system. In almost every
classical feedback controller design problem, a stabilizing feedback controller
is designed given a stabilizable unstable system. In realistic scenarios, the
system model is usually imperfect and subject to perturbations. A typical
approach to attenuate the impacts of such perturbations on the system stability
is repeating the whole controller design procedure to find an updated
stabilizing SOF controller. Such an approach can be inefficient and
occasionally infeasible. Using the notion of minimum destabilizing real
perturbation (MDRP), we construct a simple norm minimization problem (a
least-squares problem) to propose an efficient update of a nominal stabilizing
SOF controller that can be applied to various control engineering applications
in the case of perturbed scenarios like abrupt changes or inaccurate system
models. In particular, considering norm-bounded known or unknown perturbations,
this paper presents updated stabilizing SOF controllers and derives sufficient
stability conditions. Geometric metrics to quantitatively measure the
approach's robustness are defined. Moreover, we characterize the corresponding
guaranteed stability regions and specifically, for the case of norm-bounded
unknown perturbations, we propose non-fragility-based robust updated
stabilizing SOF controllers. Through extensive numerical simulations, we assess
the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Since wearable technology was first conceptualized in 1960, it has become a
crucial aspect of our daily life. People's daily lives have been made better
and their health and well-being have improved because of its convenience,
real-time, and efficiency, among other things. Haptic feedback and haptic-based
cues are crucial tools to improve interaction when trying to improve user
experience. An essential component of human-computer interface design that can
be used to improve user experience is haptic feedback. By offering a more
immersive interface, haptic feedback can improve the user experience. This
paper attempts to better understand "The role of haptic feedback in enhancing
the user experience of wearable devices" and the effects of haptic feedback on
user engagement and interaction. The findings of this study are relevant to the
developing fields of wearable technology and human-computer interaction.
Wearable technologies can be made more intuitive, user-friendly, and immersive
by considering how haptic feedback affects the user experience.

<p class="mathjax">The field of large language models (LLMs) has made significant progress, and
their knowledge storage capacity is approaching that of human beings.
Furthermore, advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement
learning, are being employed to address ethical concerns and hallucination
problems associated with LLMs, bringing them closer to aligning with human
values. This situation naturally raises the question of whether LLMs with
human-like abilities possess a human-like personality? In this paper, we aim to
investigate the feasibility of using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a
widespread human personality assessment tool, as an evaluation metric for LLMs.
Specifically, extensive experiments will be conducted to explore: 1) the
personality types of different LLMs, 2) the possibility of changing the
personality types by prompt engineering, and 3) How does the training dataset
affect the model's personality. Although the MBTI is not a rigorous assessment,
it can still reflect the similarity between LLMs and human personality. In
practice, the MBTI has the potential to serve as a rough indicator. Our codes

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study Text-to-3D content generation leveraging 2D diffusion
priors to enhance the quality and detail of the generated 3D models. Recent
progress (Magic3D) in text-to-3D has shown that employing high-resolution
(e.g., 512 x 512) renderings can lead to the production of high-quality 3D
models using latent diffusion priors. To enable rendering at even higher
resolutions, which has the potential to further augment the quality and detail
of the models, we propose a novel approach that combines multiple noise
estimation processes with a pretrained 2D diffusion prior. Distinct from the
Bar-Tal et al.s' study which binds multiple denoised results to generate images
from texts, our approach integrates the computation of scoring distillation
losses such as SDS loss and VSD loss which are essential techniques for the 3D
content generation with 2D diffusion priors. We experimentally evaluated the
proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can generate
high-quality details compared to the baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have made the ambitious quest for generalist
agents significantly far from being a fantasy. A key hurdle for building such
general models is the diversity and heterogeneity of tasks and modalities. A
promising solution is unification, allowing the support of a myriad of tasks
and modalities within one unified framework. While few large models (e.g.,
Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), trained on massive datasets, can support more
than two modalities, current small to mid-scale unified models are still
limited to 2 modalities, usually image-text or video-text. The question that we
ask is: is it possible to build efficiently a unified model that can support
all modalities? To answer this, we propose UnIVAL, a step further towards this
ambitious goal. Without relying on fancy datasets sizes or models with billions
of parameters, the ~ 0.25B parameter UnIVAL model goes beyond two modalities
and unifies text, images, video, and audio into a single model. Our model is
efficiently pretrained on many tasks, based on task balancing and multimodal
curriculum learning. UnIVAL shows competitive performance to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, across image and video-text tasks. The feature
representations learned from image and video-text modalities, allows the model
to achieve competitive performance when finetuned on audio-text tasks, despite
not being pretrained on audio. Thanks to the unified model, we propose a novel
study on multimodal model merging via weight interpolation of models trained on
different multimodal tasks, showing their benefits in particular for
out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we motivate unification by showing
the synergy between tasks. The model weights and code are released here:

<p class="mathjax">Estimating software testability can crucially assist software managers to
optimize test budgets and software quality. In this paper, we propose a new
approach that radically differs from the traditional approach of pursuing
testability measurements based on software metrics, e.g., the size of the code
or the complexity of the designs. Our approach exploits automatic test
generation and mutation analysis to quantify the evidence about the relative
hardness of developing effective test cases. In the paper, we elaborate on the
intuitions and the methodological choices that underlie our proposal for
estimating testability, introduce a technique and a prototype that allows for
concretely estimating testability accordingly, and discuss our findings out of
a set of experiments in which we compare the performance of our estimations
both against and in combination with traditional software metrics. The results
show that our testability estimates capture a complementary dimension of
testability that can be synergistically combined with approaches based on
software metrics to improve the accuracy of predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved promising results in
recent years. However, most existing reinforcement learning methods require a
large amount of data for model training. In addition, data-efficient
reinforcement learning requires the construction of strong inductive biases,
which are ignored in the current MARL approaches. Inspired by the symmetry
phenomenon in multi-agent systems, this paper proposes a framework for
exploiting prior knowledge by integrating data augmentation and a well-designed
consistency loss into the existing MARL methods. In addition, the proposed
framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to most of the current MARL
algorithms. Experimental tests on multiple challenging tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the proposed framework is
applied to a physical multi-robot testbed to show its superiority.

<p class="mathjax">In this research, we delve into the intricacies of the numerical instability
observed in 16-bit computations of machine learning models, particularly when
employing popular optimization algorithms such as RMSProp and Adam. This
instability is commonly experienced during the training phase of deep neural
networks, leading to disrupted learning processes and hindering the effective
deployment of such models. We identify the single hyperparameter, epsilon, as
the main culprit behind this numerical instability. An in-depth exploration of
the role of epsilon in these optimizers within 16-bit computations reveals that
a minor adjustment of its value can restore the functionality of RMSProp and
Adam, consequently enabling the effective utilization of 16-bit neural
networks. We propose a novel method to mitigate the identified numerical
instability issues. This method capitalizes on the updates from the Adam
optimizer and significantly improves the robustness of the learning process in
16-bit computations. This study contributes to better understanding of
optimization in low-precision computations and provides an effective solution
to a longstanding issue in training deep neural networks, opening new avenues
for more efficient and stable model training.

However, most of their users do not have the specialized knowledge to
understand the new research findings. Providing plain language summaries (PLSs)
in public libraries is a way to make the new research findings more accessible
and understandable for the public. This article proposes a framework for
providing PLSs as a new service in public libraries. Drawing from the
literature on science and society, PLSs, and public libraries, a theoretical
framework is developed. The findings suggest that public libraries can collect
PLSs through different methods, such as professional teams, researchers,
crowdsourcing, etc. Library newsletters, special publications, brochures,
independent online databases, and social networks are among the most effective
for making PLSs accessible to users. By proposing a framework for providing
PLSs in public libraries, this study helps to bridge the gap between scientific
research and the public.

<p class="mathjax">The reliability of memory devices is affected by radiation induced soft
errors. Multiple cell upsets (MCUs) caused by radiation corrupt data stored in
multiple cells within memories. Error correction codes (ECCs) are typically
used to mitigate the effects of MCUs. Single error correction-double error
detection (SEC-DED) codes are not the right choice against MCUs, but are more
suitable for protecting memory against single cell upset (SCU). Single error
correction-double adjacent error correction (SEC-DAEC) and single error
correction-double adjacent error correction-triple adjacent error correction
(SEC-DAEC-TAEC) codes are more suitable due to the increasing tendency of
adjacent errors. This paper presents the implementation of fast and low power
multi-bit adjacent error correction codes for protecting memories. Related
SEC-DAEC and SEC-DAEC-TAEC codecs with data length of 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit
have been implemented. It is found from FPGA based implementation results that
the modified designs have comparable area and have less delay and power
consumption.

<p class="mathjax">Trustworthy federated learning aims to achieve optimal performance while
ensuring clients' privacy. Existing privacy-preserving federated learning
approaches are mostly tailored for image data, lacking applications for time
series data, which have many important applications, like machine health
monitoring, human activity recognition, etc. Furthermore, protective noising on
a time series data analytics model can significantly interfere with
temporal-dependent learning, leading to a greater decline in accuracy. To
address these issues, we develop a privacy-preserving federated learning
algorithm for time series data. Specifically, we employ local differential
privacy to extend the privacy protection trust boundary to the clients. We also
incorporate shuffle techniques to achieve a privacy amplification, mitigating
the accuracy decline caused by leveraging local differential privacy. Extensive
experiments were conducted on five time series datasets. The evaluation results
reveal that our algorithm experienced minimal accuracy loss compared to
non-private federated learning in both small and large client scenarios. Under
the same level of privacy protection, our algorithm demonstrated improved
accuracy compared to the centralized differentially private federated learning
in both scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Tone is a crucial component of the prosody of Shanghainese, a Wu Chinese
variety spoken primarily in urban Shanghai. Tone sandhi, which applies to all
multi-syllabic words in Shanghainese, then, is key to natural-sounding speech.
Unfortunately, recent work on Shanghainese TTS (text-to-speech) such as Apple's
VoiceOver has shown poor performance with tone sandhi, especially LD
(left-dominant sandhi). Here I show that word segmentation during text
preprocessing can improve the quality of tone sandhi production in TTS models.
Syllables within the same word are annotated with a special symbol, which
serves as a proxy for prosodic information of the domain of LD. Contrary to the
common practice of using prosodic annotation mainly for static pauses, this
paper demonstrates that prosodic annotation can also be applied to dynamic
tonal phenomena. I anticipate this project to be a starting point for bringing
formal linguistic accounts of Shanghainese into computational projects. Too
long have we been using the Mandarin models to approximate Shanghainese, but it
is a different language with its own linguistic features, and its digitisation
and revitalisation should be treated as such.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on term-status pair extraction from medical dialogues
(MD-TSPE), which is essential in diagnosis dialogue systems and the automatic
scribe of electronic medical records (EMRs). In the past few years, works on
MD-TSPE have attracted increasing research attention, especially after the
remarkable progress made by generative methods. However, these generative
methods output a whole sequence consisting of term-status pairs in one stage
and ignore integrating prior knowledge, which demands a deeper understanding to
model the relationship between terms and infer the status of each term. This
paper presents a knowledge-enhanced two-stage generative framework (KTGF) to
address the above challenges. Using task-specific prompts, we employ a single
model to complete the MD-TSPE through two phases in a unified generative form:
we generate all terms the first and then generate the status of each generated
term. In this way, the relationship between terms can be learned more
effectively from the sequence containing only terms in the first phase, and our
designed knowledge-enhanced prompt in the second phase can leverage the
category and status candidates of the generated term for status generation.
Furthermore, our proposed special status ``not mentioned" makes more terms
available and enriches the training data in the second phase, which is critical
in the low-resource setting. The experiments on the Chunyu and CMDD datasets
show that the proposed method achieves superior results compared to the
state-of-the-art models in the full training and low-resource settings.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the performance of deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) with zero-padding in feature extraction and learning. After verifying
the roles of zero-padding in enabling translation-equivalence, and pooling in
its translation-invariance driven nature, we show that with similar number of
free parameters, any deep fully connected networks (DFCNs) can be represented
by DCNNs with zero-padding. This demonstrates that DCNNs with zero-padding is
essentially better than DFCNs in feature extraction. Consequently, we derive
universal consistency of DCNNs with zero-padding and show its
translation-invariance in the learning process. All our theoretical results are
verified by numerical experiments including both toy simulations and real-data

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has proven to be very effective in
transferring knowledge obtained from a source domain with labeled data to a
target domain with unlabeled data. Owing to the lack of labeled data in the
target domain and the possible presence of unknown classes, open-set domain
adaptation (ODA) has emerged as a potential solution to identify these classes
during the training phase. Although existing ODA approaches aim to solve the
distribution shifts between the source and target domains, most methods
fine-tuned ImageNet pre-trained models on the source domain with the adaptation
on the target domain. Recent visual-language foundation models (VLFM), such as
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), are robust to many distribution
shifts and, therefore, should substantially improve the performance of ODA. In
this work, we explore generic ways to adopt CLIP, a popular VLFM, for ODA. We
investigate the performance of zero-shot prediction using CLIP, and then
propose an entropy optimization strategy to assist the ODA models with the
outputs of CLIP. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the ODA
problem.

<p class="mathjax">In 3D shape reconstruction based on template mesh deformation, a
regularization, such as smoothness energy, is employed to guide the
reconstruction into a desirable direction. In this paper, we highlight an often
overlooked property in the regularization: the vertex density in the mesh.
Without careful control on the density, the reconstruction may suffer from
under-sampling of vertices near shape details. We propose a novel mesh density
adaptation method to resolve the under-sampling problem. Our mesh density
adaptation energy increases the density of vertices near complex structures via
deformation to help reconstruction of shape details. We demonstrate the
usability and performance of mesh density adaptation with two tasks, inverse
rendering and non-rigid surface registration. Our method produces more accurate
reconstruction results compared to the cases without mesh density adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be embodied in software agents,
robots, and cyber-physical systems that can understand the various contextual
information of daily life in the home environment to support human behavior and
decision making in various situations. Scene graph and knowledge graph (KG)
construction technologies have attracted much attention for knowledge-based
embodied question answering meeting this expectation. However, collecting and
managing real data on daily activities under various experimental conditions in
a physical space are quite costly, and developing AI that understands the
intentions and contexts is difficult. In the future, data from both virtual
spaces, where conditions can be easily modified, and physical spaces, where
conditions are difficult to change, are expected to be combined to analyze
daily living activities. However, studies on the KG construction of daily
activities using virtual space and their application have yet to progress. The
potential and challenges must still be clarified to facilitate AI development
for human daily life. Thus, this study proposes the VirtualHome2KG framework to
generate synthetic KGs of daily life activities in virtual space. This
framework augments both the synthetic video data of daily activities and the
contextual semantic data corresponding to the video contents based on the
proposed event-centric schema and virtual space simulation results. Therefore,
context-aware data can be analyzed, and various applications that have
conventionally been difficult to develop due to the insufficient availability
of relevant data and semantic information can be developed. We also demonstrate
herein the utility and potential of the proposed VirtualHome2KG framework
through several use cases, including the analysis of daily activities by
querying, embedding, and clustering, and fall risk detection among ...

<p class="mathjax">One of the key AI tools for textual corpora exploration is natural language
question-answering (QA). Unlike keyword-based search engines, QA algorithms
receive and process natural language questions and produce precise answers to
these questions, rather than long lists of documents that need to be manually
scanned by the users. State-of-the-art QA algorithms based on DNNs were
successfully employed in various domains. However, QA in the genealogical
domain is still underexplored, while researchers in this field (and other
fields in humanities and social sciences) can highly benefit from the ability
to ask questions in natural language, receive concrete answers and gain
insights hidden within large corpora. While some research has been recently
conducted for factual QA in the genealogical domain, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no previous research on the more challenging task of
numerical aggregation QA (i.e., answering questions combining aggregation
functions, e.g., count, average, max). Numerical aggregation QA is critical for
distant reading and analysis for researchers (and the general public)
interested in investigating cultural heritage domains. Therefore, in this
study, we present a new end-to-end methodology for numerical aggregation QA for
genealogical trees that includes: 1) an automatic method for training dataset
generation; 2) a transformer-based table selection method, and 3) an optimized
transformer-based numerical aggregation QA model. The findings indicate that
the proposed architecture, GLOBE, outperforms the state-of-the-art models and
pipelines by achieving 87% accuracy for this task compared to only 21% by
current state-of-the-art models. This study may have practical implications for
genealogical information centers and museums, making genealogical data research
easy and scalable for experts as well as the general public.

<p class="mathjax">As a crucial extension of entity alignment (EA), multi-modal entity alignment
(MMEA) aims to identify identical entities across disparate knowledge graphs
(KGs) by exploiting associated visual information. However, existing MMEA
approaches primarily concentrate on the fusion paradigm of multi-modal entity
features, while neglecting the challenges presented by the pervasive phenomenon
of missing and intrinsic ambiguity of visual images. In this paper, we present
a further analysis of visual modality incompleteness, benchmarking latest MMEA
models on our proposed dataset MMEA-UMVM, where the types of alignment KGs
covering bilingual and monolingual, with standard (non-iterative) and iterative
training paradigms to evaluate the model performance. Our research indicates
that, in the face of modality incompleteness, models succumb to overfitting the
modality noise, and exhibit performance oscillations or declines at high rates
of missing modality. This proves that the inclusion of additional multi-modal
data can sometimes adversely affect EA. To address these challenges, we
introduce UMAEA , a robust multi-modal entity alignment approach designed to
tackle uncertainly missing and ambiguous visual modalities. It consistently
achieves SOTA performance across all 97 benchmark splits, significantly
surpassing existing baselines with limited parameters and time consumption,
while effectively alleviating the identified limitations of other models. Our
code and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/UMAEA.

<p class="mathjax">In real-world multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) applications, agents
may not have perfect state information (e.g., due to inaccurate measurement or
malicious attacks), which challenges the robustness of agents' policies. Though
robustness is getting important in MARL deployment, little prior work has
studied state uncertainties in MARL, neither in problem formulation nor
algorithm design. Motivated by this robustness issue and the lack of
corresponding studies, we study the problem of MARL with state uncertainty in
this work. We provide the first attempt to the theoretical and empirical
analysis of this challenging problem. We first model the problem as a Markov
Game with state perturbation adversaries (MG-SPA) by introducing a set of state
perturbation adversaries into a Markov Game. We then introduce robust
equilibrium (RE) as the solution concept of an MG-SPA. We conduct a fundamental
analysis regarding MG-SPA such as giving conditions under which such a robust
equilibrium exists. Then we propose a robust multi-agent Q-learning (RMAQ)
algorithm to find such an equilibrium, with convergence guarantees. To handle
high-dimensional state-action space, we design a robust multi-agent
actor-critic (RMAAC) algorithm based on an analytical expression of the policy
gradient derived in the paper. Our experiments show that the proposed RMAQ
algorithm converges to the optimal value function; our RMAAC algorithm
outperforms several MARL and robust MARL methods in multiple multi-agent
environments when state uncertainty is present. The source code is public on

<p class="mathjax">Over the past few decades, large archives of paper-based historical
documents, such as books and newspapers, have been digitized using the Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Unfortunately, this broadly used
technology is error-prone, especially when an OCRed document was written
hundreds of years ago. Neural networks have shown great success in solving
various text processing tasks, including OCR post-correction. The main
disadvantage of using neural networks for historical corpora is the lack of
sufficiently large training datasets they require to learn from, especially for
morphologically-rich languages like Hebrew. Moreover, it is not clear what are
the optimal structure and values of hyperparameters (predefined parameters) of
neural networks for OCR error correction in Hebrew due to its unique features.
Furthermore, languages change across genres and periods. These changes may
affect the accuracy of OCR post-correction neural network models. To overcome
these challenges, we developed a new multi-phase method for generating
artificial training datasets with OCR errors and hyperparameters optimization
for building an effective neural network for OCR post-correction in Hebrew.

<p class="mathjax">With the rising popularity of user-generated genealogical family trees, new
genealogical information systems have been developed. State-of-the-art natural
question answering algorithms use deep neural network (DNN) architecture based
on self-attention networks. However, some of these models use sequence-based
inputs and are not suitable to work with graph-based structure, while
graph-based DNN models rely on high levels of comprehensiveness of knowledge
graphs that is nonexistent in the genealogical domain. Moreover, these
supervised DNN models require training datasets that are absent in the
genealogical domain. This study proposes an end-to-end approach for question
answering using genealogical family trees by: 1) representing genealogical data
as knowledge graphs, 2) converting them to texts, 3) combining them with
unstructured texts, and 4) training a trans-former-based question answering
model. To evaluate the need for a dedicated approach, a comparison between the
fine-tuned model (Uncle-BERT) trained on the auto-generated genealogical
dataset and state-of-the-art question-answering models was per-formed. The
findings indicate that there are significant differences between answering
genealogical questions and open-domain questions. Moreover, the proposed
methodology reduces complexity while increasing accuracy and may have practical
implications for genealogical research and real-world projects, making
genealogical data accessible to experts as well as the general public.

service tasks at hospitals, contributing to enhanced efficiency and meeting
medical demands. This paper investigates the optimization problem of scheduling
strategies for AMRs at smart hospitals, where the service and travel times of
AMRs are stochastic. We formulate a stochastic mixed integer programming model
to minimize the total cost of the hospital by reducing the number of AMRs and
travel distance while satisfying constraints such as AMR battery state of
charge, AMR capacity, and time windows for medical requests. To address this
objective, we identify several properties for generating high-quality solutions
efficiently. We improve the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm by
incorporating the properties of the AMR scheduling problem to solve the model.
Experimental results demonstrate that VNS generates higher-quality solutions
compared to existing methods. By intelligently arranging the driving routes of
AMRs for both charging and service requests, we achieve substantial cost
reductions for hospitals, enhancing the utilization of medical resources.

aimed at making resources such as texts, images, audio, video, and other

deep neural networks (DNN) dominate the field of automatic text analysis and
natural language processing (NLP), in some cases presenting a super-human

many NLP tasks that are relevant for Digital Humanities (DH) research, such as
spell checking, language detection, entity extraction, author detection,
question answering, and other tasks. These supervised algorithms learn patterns
from a large number of "right" and "wrong" examples and apply them to new
examples. However, using DNNs for analyzing the text resources in DH research
presents two main challenges: (un)availability of training data and a need for
domain adaptation. This paper explores these challenges by analyzing multiple
use-cases of DH studies in recent literature and their possible solutions and
lays out a practical decision model for DH experts for when and how to choose
the appropriate deep learning approaches for their research. Moreover, in this

books and newspapers have been digitized using Optical Character Recognition.
This technology is error-prone, especially for historical documents. To correct
OCR errors, post-processing algorithms have been proposed based on natural
language analysis and machine learning techniques such as neural networks.
Neural network's disadvantage is the vast amount of manually labeled data
required for training, which is often unavailable. This paper proposes an
innovative method for training a light-weight neural network for Hebrew OCR
post-correction using significantly less manually created data. The main
research goal is to develop a method for automatically generating language and
task-specific training data to improve the neural network results for OCR
post-correction, and to investigate which type of dataset is the most effective
for OCR post-correction of historical documents. To this end, a series of
experiments using several datasets was conducted. The evaluation corpus was
based on Hebrew newspapers from the JPress project. An analysis of historical
OCRed newspapers was done to learn common language and corpus-specific OCR
errors. We found that training the network using the proposed method is more
effective than using randomly generated errors. The results also show that the
performance of the neural network for OCR post-correction strongly depends on
the genre and area of the training data. Moreover, neural networks that were
trained with the proposed method outperform other state-of-the-art neural
networks for OCR post-correction and complex spellcheckers. These results may
have practical implications for many digital humanities projects.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation plays a critical role in clinical decision-making,
treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, accurate segmentation of
medical images is challenging due to several factors, such as the lack of
high-quality annotation, imaging noise, and anatomical differences across
patients. In addition, there is still a considerable gap in performance between
the existing label-efficient methods and fully-supervised methods. To address
the above challenges, we propose ScribbleVC, a novel framework for
scribble-supervised medical image segmentation that leverages vision and class
embeddings via the multimodal information enhancement mechanism. In addition,
ScribbleVC uniformly utilizes the CNN features and Transformer features to
achieve better visual feature extraction. The proposed method combines a
scribble-based approach with a segmentation network and a class-embedding

<p class="mathjax">Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the style of an artwork to a
photograph while maintaining its original overall content. Many prior works
focus on designing various transfer modules to transfer the style statistics to
the content image. Although effective, ignoring the clear disentanglement of
the content features and the style features from the first beginning, they have
difficulty in balancing between content preservation and style transferring. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel information disentanglement method,
named InfoStyler, to capture the minimal sufficient information for both
content and style representations from the pre-trained encoding network.
InfoStyler formulates the disentanglement representation learning as an
information compression problem by eliminating style statistics from the
content image and removing the content structure from the style image. Besides,
to further facilitate disentanglement learning, a cross-domain Information
Bottleneck (IB) learning strategy is proposed by reconstructing the content and
style domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our InfoStyler can
synthesize high-quality stylized images while balancing content structure
preservation and style pattern richness.

<p class="mathjax">Electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) are getting attention in future
autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems due to their economic and societal
benefits. However, EAVs' unique charging patterns (long charging time, high
charging frequency, unpredictable charging behaviors, etc.) make it challenging
to accurately predict the EAVs supply in E-AMoD systems. Furthermore, the
mobility demand's prediction uncertainty makes it an urgent and challenging
task to design an integrated vehicle balancing solution under supply and demand
uncertainties. Despite the success of reinforcement learning-based E-AMoD
balancing algorithms, state uncertainties under the EV supply or mobility
demand remain unexplored. In this work, we design a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL)-based framework for EAVs balancing in E-AMoD systems, with
adversarial agents to model both the EAVs supply and mobility demand
uncertainties that may undermine the vehicle balancing solutions. We then
propose a robust E-AMoD Balancing MARL (REBAMA) algorithm to train a robust
EAVs balancing policy to balance both the supply-demand ratio and charging
utilization rate across the whole city. Experiments show that our proposed
robust method performs better compared with a non-robust MARL method that does
not consider state uncertainties; it improves the reward, charging utilization
fairness, and supply-demand fairness by 19.28%, 28.18%, and 3.97%,
respectively. Compared with a robust optimization-based method, the proposed
MARL algorithm can improve the reward, charging utilization fairness, and
supply-demand fairness by 8.21%, 8.29%, and 9.42%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) have
been mitigating the potential harms of text generated by the LLMs, including
fake news and copyright issues. However, the watermark detection of current
text algorithms requires the key from the generation process, making them
susceptible to breaches and counterfeiting. In this work, we propose the first
private watermarking algorithm, which extends the current text watermarking
algorithms by using two different neural networks respectively for watermark
generation and detection, rather than using the same key at both stages.
Meanwhile, part of the parameters of the watermark generation and detection
networks are shared, which makes the detection network achieve a high accuracy
very efficiently. Experiments show that our algorithm ensures high detection
accuracy with minimal impact on generation and detection speed, due to the
small parameter size of both networks. Additionally, our subsequent analysis
demonstrates the difficulty of reverting the watermark generation rules from
the detection network.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchain-based decentralized identity management provides a promising
solution to improve the security and privacy of healthcare systems and make
them scalable. Traditional Identity Management Systems are centralized, which
makes them single-point-of-failure, vulnerable to attacks and data breaches,
and non-scalable. In contrast, decentralized identity management based on the
blockchain can ensure secure and transparent access to patient data while
preserving privacy. This approach enables patients to control their personal
health data while granting permission for medical personnel to access specific
information as needed. We propose a decentralized identity management system
for healthcare systems named BDIMHS based on a permissioned blockchain with
Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. We develop further descriptions of
required functionalities and provide high-level procedures for network
initialization, enrollment, registration, issuance, verification and revocation
functionalities. The proposed solution improves data security, privacy,
immutability, interoperability, and patient autonomy by using selective
disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable
Credentials. Furthermore, we discuss the potential challenges associated with
implementing this technology in healthcare and evaluate the performance and
security of the proposed solution.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous navigation of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) in marine
environments with current flows is challenging, and few prior works have
addressed the sensorbased navigation problem in such environments under no
prior knowledge of the current flow and obstacles. We propose a Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (RL) based local path planner that learns return
distributions which capture the uncertainty of action outcomes, and an adaptive
algorithm that automatically tunes the level of sensitivity to the risk in the
environment. The proposed planner achieves a more stable learning performance
and converges to safer policies than a traditional RL based planner.
Computational experiments demonstrate that comparing to a traditional RL based
planner and classical local planning methods such as Artificial Potential
Fields and the Bug Algorithm, the proposed planner is robust against
environmental flows, and is able to plan trajectories that are superior in
safety, time and energy consumption.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an efficient deep learning method for single image defocus
deblurring (SIDD) by further exploring inverse kernel properties. Although the
current inverse kernel method, i.e., kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolution
(KPAC), can address spatially varying defocus blurs, it has difficulty in
handling large blurs of this kind. To tackle this issue, we propose a Residual
and Recursive Kernel-sharing Atrous Convolution (R$^2$KAC). R$^2$KAC builds on
a significant observation of inverse kernels, that is, successive use of
inverse-kernel-based deconvolutions with fixed size helps remove unexpected
large blurs but produces ringing artifacts. Specifically, on top of
kernel-sharing atrous convolutions used to simulate multi-scale inverse
kernels, R$^2$KAC applies atrous convolutions recursively to simulate a large
inverse kernel. Specifically, on top of kernel-sharing atrous convolutions,
R$^2$KAC stacks atrous convolutions recursively to simulate a large inverse
kernel. To further alleviate the contingent effect of recursive stacking, i.e.,
ringing artifacts, we add identity shortcuts between atrous convolutions to
simulate residual deconvolutions. Lastly, a scale recurrent module is embedded
in the R$^2$KAC network, leading to SR-R$^2$KAC, so that multi-scale
information from coarse to fine is exploited to progressively remove the
spatially varying defocus blurs. Extensive experimental results show that our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

management. To provide an overview of the main initiatives in this blockchain
application area, we have first reviewed the existing academic literature. The
review shows literature is still scarce and immature in many aspects, which is
more evident when comparing it to initiatives coming from the industry.
Blockchain has been receiving significant inflows of venture capital and
crowdfunding, which have boosted its progress in many fields, including its
application to media management. Consequently, we have complemented the review
with a business perspective. Existing reports about blockchain and media have
been studied and consolidated into four prominent use cases. Moreover, each one
has been illustrated through existing businesses already exploring them.
Combining the academic and industry perspectives, we provide a more general and

<p class="mathjax">Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction (PDRP), which aims to estimate the
future service route of a worker given his current task pool, has received
rising attention in recent years. Deep neural networks based on supervised
learning have emerged as the dominant model for the task because of their
powerful ability to capture workers' behavior patterns from massive historical
data. Though promising, they fail to introduce the non-differentiable test
criteria into the training process, leading to a mismatch in training and test
criteria. Which considerably trims down their performance when applied in
practical systems. To tackle the above issue, we present the first attempt to
generalize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the route prediction task, leading to
a novel RL-based framework called DRL4Route. It combines the behavior-learning
abilities of previous deep learning models with the non-differentiable
objective optimization ability of reinforcement learning. DRL4Route can serve
as a plug-and-play component to boost the existing deep learning models. Based
on the framework, we further implement a model named DRL4Route-GAE for PDRP in
logistic service. It follows the actor-critic architecture which is equipped
with a Generalized Advantage Estimator that can balance the bias and variance
of the policy gradient estimates, thus achieving a more optimal policy.
Extensive offline experiments and the online deployment show that DRL4Route-GAE
improves Location Square Deviation (LSD) by 0.9%-2.7%, and Accuracy@3 (ACC@3)
by 2.4%-3.2% over existing methods on the real-world dataset.

specifically, we show that there is an Abelian group $(H,+)$ of constant size

$h$) is correlated with a function of the form $\tilde{f}(x) =

<p class="mathjax">Recently, handwritten Chinese character error correction has been greatly
improved by employing encoder-decoder methods to decompose a Chinese character
into an ideographic description sequence (IDS). However, existing methods
implicitly capture and encode linguistic information inherent in IDS sequences,
leading to a tendency to generate IDS sequences that match seen characters.
This poses a challenge when dealing with an unseen misspelled character, as the
decoder may generate an IDS sequence that matches a seen character instead.
Therefore, we introduce Count, Decode and Fetch (CDF), a novel approach that
exhibits better generalization towards unseen misspelled characters. CDF is
mainly composed of three parts: the counter, the decoder, and the fetcher. In
the first stage, the counter predicts the number of each radical class without
the symbol-level position annotations. In the second stage, the decoder employs
the counting information and generates the IDS sequence step by step. Moreover,
by updating the counting information at each time step, the decoder becomes
aware of the existence of each radical. With the decomposed IDS sequence, we
can determine whether the given character is misspelled. If it is misspelled,
the fetcher under the transductive transfer learning strategy predicts the
ideal character that the user originally intended to write. We integrate our
method into existing encoder-decoder models and significantly enhance their
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate shape reconstruction of transparent objects is a challenging task
due to their non-Lambertian surfaces and yet necessary for robots for accurate
pose perception and safe manipulation. As vision-based sensing can produce
erroneous measurements for transparent objects, the tactile modality is not
sensitive to object transparency and can be used for reconstructing the
object's shape. We propose ACTOR, a novel framework for ACtive tactile-based
category-level Transparent Object Reconstruction. ACTOR leverages large
datasets of synthetic object with our proposed self-supervised learning
approach for object shape reconstruction as the collection of real-world
tactile data is prohibitively expensive. ACTOR can be used during inference
with tactile data from category-level unknown transparent objects for
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an active-tactile object exploration
strategy as probing every part of the object surface can be sample inefficient.
We also demonstrate tactile-based category-level object pose estimation task
using ACTOR. We perform an extensive evaluation of our proposed methodology
with real-world robotic experiments with comprehensive comparison studies with
state-of-the-art approaches. Our proposed method outperforms these approaches
in terms of tactile-based object reconstruction and object pose estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation typically necessitates a large and precisely
annotated dataset. However, obtaining pixel-wise annotation is a
labor-intensive task that requires significant effort from domain experts,
making it challenging to obtain in practical clinical scenarios. In such
situations, reducing the amount of annotation required is a more practical
approach. One feasible direction is sparse annotation, which involves
annotating only a few slices, and has several advantages over traditional weak
annotation methods such as bounding boxes and scribbles, as it preserves exact
boundaries. However, learning from sparse annotation is challenging due to the
scarcity of supervision signals. To address this issue, we propose a framework
that can robustly learn from sparse annotation using the cross-teaching of both
3D and 2D networks. Considering the characteristic of these networks, we
develop two pseudo label selection strategies, which are hard-soft confidence
threshold and consistent label fusion. Our experimental results on the MMWHS
dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
semi-supervised segmentation methods. Moreover, our approach achieves results
that are comparable to the fully-supervised upper bound result.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the system model and the transmit beamforming design
for the Cell-Free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) system. The impact of the uncertainty of the target
locations on the propagation of wireless signals is considered during both
uplink and downlink phases, and especially, the main statistics of the MIMO
channel estimation error are theoretically derived in the closed-form fashion.
A fundamental performance metric, termed communication-sensing (C-S) region, is
defined for the considered system via three cases, i.e., the sensing-only case,
the communication-only case and the ISAC case. The transmit beamforming design
problems for the three cases are respectively carried out through different
reformulations, e.g., the Lagrangian dual transform and the quadratic
fractional transform, and some combinations of the block coordinate descent
method and the successive convex approximation method. Numerical results
present a 3-dimensional C-S region with a dynamic number of access points to
illustrate the trade-off between communication and radar sensing. The advantage
for radar sensing of the Cell-Free massive MIMO system is also studied via a
comparison with the traditional cellular system. Finally, the efficacy of the
proposed beamforming scheme is validated in comparison with zero-forcing and
maximum ratio transmission schemes.

<p class="mathjax">The recent advancements in deep learning have brought about significant
changes in various aspects of people's lives. Meanwhile, these rapid
developments have raised concerns about the legitimacy of the training process
of deep networks. However, to protect the intellectual properties of untrusted
AI developers, directly examining the training process by accessing the model
parameters and training data by verifiers is often prohibited.
<br />In response to this challenge, we present zkDL, an efficient zero-knowledge
proof of deep learning training. At the core of zkDL is zkReLU, a specialized
zero-knowledge proof protocol with optimized proving time and proof size for
the ReLU activation function, a major obstacle in verifiable training due to
its non-arithmetic nature. To integrate zkReLU into the proof system for the
entire training process, we devise a novel construction of an arithmetic
circuit from neural networks. By leveraging the abundant parallel computation
resources, this construction reduces proving time and proof sizes by a factor
of the network depth. As a result, zkDL enables the generation of complete and
sound proofs, taking less than a minute with a size of less than 20 kB per
training step, for a 16-layer neural network with 200M parameters, while
ensuring the privacy of data and model parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Generative Adversarial Networks are used for generating the data using a
generator and a discriminator, GANs usually produce high-quality images, but
training GANs in an adversarial setting is a difficult task. GANs require high
computation power and hyper-parameter regularization for converging. Projected
GANs tackle the training difficulty of GANs by using transfer learning to
project the generated and real samples into a pre-trained feature space.
Projected GANs improve the training time and convergence but produce artifacts
in the generated images which reduce the quality of the generated samples, we
propose an optimized architecture called Stylized Projected GANs which
integrates the mapping network of the Style GANs with Skip Layer Excitation of
Fast GAN. The integrated modules are incorporated within the generator
architecture of the Fast GAN to mitigate the problem of artifacts in the

lower courts based on case information available at filing. The model is built
on a dataset of 4.2 million court cases filed in 2010 and their outcomes over a
10-year period. The data set is drawn from 7000+ lower courts in India. The
authors employed AutoML to develop a multi-class classification model over all
periods of pendency and then used binary decision forest classifiers to improve
predictive accuracy for the classification of delays. The best model achieved
an accuracy of 81.4%, and the precision, recall, and F1 were found to be 0.81.
The study demonstrates the feasibility of AI models for predicting delays in
Indian courts, based on relevant data points such as jurisdiction, court,
judge, subject, and the parties involved. The paper also discusses the results
in light of relevant literature and suggests areas for improvement and future
research. The authors have made the dataset and Python code files used for the

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of cloud computing and big data technologies,
storage systems have become a fundamental building block of datacenters,
incorporating hardware innovations such as flash solid state drives and
non-volatile memories, as well as software infrastructures such as RAID and
distributed file systems. Despite the growing popularity and interests in
storage, designing and implementing reliable storage systems remains
challenging, due to their performance instability and prevailing hardware
failures.
<br />Proactive prediction greatly strengthens the reliability of storage systems.
There are two dimensions of prediction: performance and failure. Ideally,
through detecting in advance the slow IO requests, and predicting device
failures before they really happen, we can build storage systems with
especially low tail latency and high availability. While its importance is well
recognized, such proactive prediction in storage systems, on the other hand, is
particularly difficult. To move towards predictability of storage systems,
various mechanisms and field studies have been proposed in the past few years.
In this report, we present a survey of these mechanisms and field studies,
focusing on machine learning based black-box approaches. Based on three
representative research works, we discuss where and how machine learning should
be applied in this field. The strengths and limitations of each research work
are also evaluated in detail.

<p class="mathjax">Plastic has imbibed itself as an indispensable part of our day to day
activities, becoming a source of problems due to its non-biodegradable nature
and cheaper production prices. With these problems, comes the challenge of
mitigating and responding to the aftereffects of disposal or the lack of proper
disposal which leads to waste concentrating in locations and disturbing
ecosystems for both plants and animals. As plastic debris levels continue to
rise with the accumulation of waste in garbage patches in landfills and more
hazardously in natural water bodies, swift action is necessary to plug or cease
this flow. While manual sorting operations and detection can offer a solution,
they can be augmented using highly advanced computer imagery linked with
robotic appendages for removing wastes. The primary application of focus in
this report are the much-discussed Computer Vision and Open Vision which have
gained novelty for their light dependence on internet and ability to relay
information in remote areas. These applications can be applied to the creation
of edge-based mobility devices that can as a counter to the growing problem of
plastic debris in oceans and rivers, demanding little connectivity and still
offering the same results with reasonably timed maintenance. The principal
findings of this project cover the various methods that were tested and
deployed to detect waste in images, as well as comparing them against different
waste types. The project has been able to produce workable models that can
perform on time detection of sampled images using an augmented CNN approach.
Latter portions of the project have also achieved a better interpretation of
the necessary preprocessing steps required to arrive at the best accuracies,
including the best hardware for expanding waste detection studies to larger
environments.

use different approaches to achieve better performance. However, many of them
do not use information about the time of prediction and time intervals between
baskets. To fill this gap, we propose a novel method, Time-Aware Item-based
Weighting (TAIW), which takes timestamps and intervals into account. We provide
experiments on three real-world datasets, and TAIW outperforms well-tuned
state-of-the-art baselines for next-basket recommendations. In addition, we
show the results of an ablation study and a case study of a few items.

<p class="mathjax">This article introduces HODLR3D, a class of hierarchical matrices arising out
of $N$-body problems in three dimensions. HODLR3D relies on the fact that
certain off-diagonal matrix sub-blocks arising out of the $N$-body problems in
three dimensions are numerically low-rank. For the Laplace kernel in $3$D,
which is widely encountered, we prove that all the off-diagonal matrix
sub-blocks are rank deficient in finite precision. We also obtain the growth of
the rank as a function of the size of these matrix sub-blocks. For other
kernels in three dimensions, we numerically illustrate a similar scaling in
rank for the different off-diagonal sub-blocks. We leverage this hierarchical
low-rank structure to construct HODLR3D representation, with which we
accelerate matrix-vector products. The storage and computational complexity of
the HODLR3D matrix-vector product scales almost linearly with system size. We
demonstrate the computational performance of HODLR3D representation through
various numerical experiments. Further, we explore the performance of the
HODLR3D representation on distributed memory systems. HODLR3D, described in
this article, is based on a weak admissibility condition. Among the
hierarchical matrices with different weak admissibility conditions in $3$D,
only in HODLR3D did the rank of the admissible off-diagonal blocks not scale
with any power of the system size. Thus, the storage and the computational
complexity of the HODLR3D matrix-vector product remain tractable for $N$-body
problems with large system sizes.

<p class="mathjax">Predict and optimize is an increasingly popular decision-making paradigm that
employs machine learning to predict unknown parameters of optimization
problems. Instead of minimizing the prediction error of the parameters, it
trains predictive models using task performance as a loss function. In the
convex optimization domain, predict and optimize has seen significant progress
due to recently developed methods for differentiating optimization problem
solutions over the problem parameters. This paper identifies a yet unnoticed
drawback of this approach -- the zero-gradient problem -- and introduces a
method to solve it. The suggested method is based on the mathematical
properties of differential optimization and is verified using two real-world
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Many decision-making scenarios, e.g., public policy, healthcare, business,
and disaster response, require accommodating the preferences of multiple
stakeholders. We offer the first formal treatment of reasoning with
multi-stakeholder qualitative preferences in a setting where stakeholders
express their preferences in a qualitative preference language, e.g., CP-net,
CI-net, TCP-net, CP-Theory. We introduce a query language for expressing
queries against such preferences over sets of outcomes that satisfy specified
criteria, e.g., $\mlangpref{\psi_1}{\psi_2}{A}$ (read loosely as the set of
outcomes satisfying $\psi_1$ that are preferred over outcomes satisfying
$\psi_2$ by a set of stakeholders $A$). Motivated by practical application
scenarios, we introduce and analyze several alternative semantics for such
queries, and examine their interrelationships. We provide a provably correct
algorithm for answering multi-stakeholder qualitative preference queries using
model checking in alternation-free $\mu$-calculus. We present experimental
results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Video-based scene graph generation (VidSGG) is an approach that aims to
represent video content in a dynamic graph by identifying visual entities and
their relationships. Due to the inherently biased distribution and missing
annotations in the training data, current VidSGG methods have been found to
perform poorly on less-represented predicates. In this paper, we propose an
explicit solution to address this under-explored issue by supplementing missing
predicates that should be appear in the ground-truth annotations. Dubbed Trico,
our method seeks to supplement the missing predicates by exploring three
complementary spatio-temporal correlations. Guided by these correlations, the
missing labels can be effectively supplemented thus achieving an unbiased
predicate predictions. We validate the effectiveness of Trico on the most
widely used VidSGG datasets, i.e., VidVRD and VidOR. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance achieved by Trico, particularly on
those tail predicates.

<p class="mathjax">In the digital age, data is a valuable commodity, and data marketplaces offer
lucrative opportunities for data owners to monetize their private data.
However, data privacy is a significant concern, and differential privacy has
become a popular solution to address this issue. Private data trading systems
(PDQS) facilitate the trade of private data by determining which data owners to
purchase data from, the amount of privacy purchased, and providing specific
aggregation statistics while protecting the privacy of data owners. However,
existing PDQS with separated procurement and query processes are prone to
over-perturbation of private data and lack trustworthiness. To address this
issue, this paper proposes a framework for PDQS with an integrated procurement
and query process to avoid excessive perturbation of private data. We also
present two instances of this framework, one based on a greedy approach and
another based on a neural network. Our experimental results show that both of
our mechanisms outperformed the separately conducted procurement and query
mechanism under the same budget regarding accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">The robot exploration task has been widely studied with applications spanning
from novel environment mapping to item delivery. For some time-critical tasks,
such as rescue catastrophes, the agent is required to explore as efficiently as
possible. Recently, Visit Frequency-based map representation achieved great
success in such scenarios by discouraging repetitive visits with a
frequency-based penalty. However, its relatively large size and single-agent
settings hinder its further development. In this context, we propose Integrated
Visit Frequency Map, which encodes identical information as Visit Frequency Map
with a more compact size, and a visit frequency-based multi-agent information
exchange and control scheme that is able to accommodate both representations.
Through tests in diverse settings, the results indicate our proposed methods
can achieve a comparable level of performance of VFM with lower bandwidth
requirements and generalize well to different multi-agent setups including
real-world environments.

<p class="mathjax">Markerless motion capture (MMC) is revolutionizing gait analysis in clinical
settings by making it more accessible, raising the question of how to extract
the most clinically meaningful information from gait data. In multiple fields
ranging from image processing to natural language processing, self-supervised
learning (SSL) from large amounts of unannotated data produces very effective
representations for downstream tasks. However, there has only been limited use
of SSL to learn effective representations of gait and movement, and it has not
been applied to gait analysis with MMC. One SSL objective that has not been
applied to gait is contrastive learning, which finds representations that place
similar samples closer together in the learned space. If the learned similarity
metric captures clinically meaningful differences, this could produce a useful
representation for many downstream clinical tasks. Contrastive learning can
also be combined with causal masking to predict future timesteps, which is an
appealing SSL objective given the dynamical nature of gait. We applied these
techniques to gait analyses performed with MMC in a rehabilitation hospital
from a diverse clinical population. We find that contrastive learning on
unannotated gait data learns a representation that captures clinically
meaningful information. We probe this learned representation using the
framework of biomarkers and show it holds promise as both a diagnostic and
response biomarker, by showing it can accurately classify diagnosis from gait
and is responsive to inpatient therapy, respectively. We ultimately hope these
learned representations will enable predictive and prognostic gait-based
biomarkers that can facilitate precision rehabilitation through greater use of
MMC to quantify movement in rehabilitation.

promising results in a variety of speech-processing tasks, especially in

the task of mispronunciation detection for second language learners. We compare
two downstream approaches: 1) training the model for phone recognition (PR)
using native English data, and 2) training a model directly for the target task
using non-native English data. We compare the performance of these two
approaches for various SSL representations as well as a representation
extracted from a traditional DNN-based speech recognition model. We evaluate
the models on L2Arctic and EpaDB, two datasets of non-native speech annotated
with pronunciation labels at the phone level. Overall, we find that using a
downstream model trained for the target task gives the best performance and
that most upstream models perform similarly for the task.

<p class="mathjax">The demand for automated security analysis techniques, such as static
analysis based security testing (SAST) tools continues to increase. To develop
SASTs that are effectively leveraged by developers for finding vulnerabilities,
researchers and tool designers must understand how developers perceive, select,
and use SASTs, what they expect from the tools, whether they know of the
limitations of the tools, and how they address those limitations. This paper
describes a qualitative study that explores the assumptions, expectations,
beliefs, and challenges experienced by developers who use SASTs. We perform
in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 practitioners who possess a
diverse range of software development expertise, as well as a variety of unique
security, product, and organizational backgrounds. We identify $17$ key
findings that shed light on developer perceptions and desires related to SASTs,
and also expose gaps in the status quo -- challenging long-held beliefs in SAST
design priorities. Finally, we provide concrete future directions for
researchers and practitioners rooted in an analysis of our findings.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial examples threaten the integrity of machine learning systems with
alarming success rates even under constrained black-box conditions. Stateful
defenses have emerged as an effective countermeasure, detecting potential
attacks by maintaining a buffer of recent queries and detecting new queries
that are too similar. However, these defenses fundamentally pose a trade-off
between attack detection and false positive rates, and this trade-off is
typically optimized by hand-picking feature extractors and similarity
thresholds that empirically work well. There is little current understanding as
to the formal limits of this trade-off and the exact properties of the feature
extractors/underlying problem domain that influence it. This work aims to
address this gap by offering a theoretical characterization of the trade-off
between detection and false positive rates for stateful defenses. We provide
upper bounds for detection rates of a general class of feature extractors and
analyze the impact of this trade-off on the convergence of black-box attacks.
We then support our theoretical findings with empirical evaluations across
multiple datasets and stateful defenses.

<p class="mathjax">A non-intrusive proper generalized decomposition (PGD) strategy, coupled with
an overlapping domain decomposition (DD) method, is proposed to efficiently
construct surrogate models of parametric linear elliptic problems. A parametric
multi-domain formulation is presented, with local subproblems featuring
arbitrary Dirichlet interface conditions represented through the traces of the
finite element functions used for spatial discretization at the subdomain
level, with no need for additional auxiliary basis functions. The linearity of
the operator is exploited to devise low-dimensional problems with only few
active boundary parameters. An overlapping Schwarz method is used to glue the
local surrogate models, solving a linear system for the nodal values of the
parametric solution at the interfaces, without introducing Lagrange multipliers
to enforce the continuity in the overlapping region. The proposed DD-PGD
methodology relies on a fully algebraic formulation allowing for real-time
computation based on the efficient interpolation of the local surrogate models
in the parametric space, with no additional problems to be solved during the
execution of the Schwarz algorithm. Numerical results for parametric diffusion
and convection-diffusion problems are presented to showcase the accuracy of the
DD-PGD approach, its robustness in different regimes and its superior
performance with respect to standard high-fidelity DD methods.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities in generating
realistic text across diverse subjects. Concerns have been raised that they
could be utilized to produce fake content with a deceptive intention, although
evidence thus far remains anecdotal. This paper presents a case study about a
Twitter botnet that appears to employ ChatGPT to generate human-like content.
Through heuristics, we identify 1,140 accounts and validate them via manual
annotation. These accounts form a dense cluster of fake personas that exhibit
similar behaviors, including posting machine-generated content and stolen
images, and engage with each other through replies and retweets.
ChatGPT-generated content promotes suspicious websites and spreads harmful
comments. While the accounts in the AI botnet can be detected through their
coordination patterns, current state-of-the-art LLM content classifiers fail to
discriminate between them and human accounts in the wild. These findings
highlight the threats posed by AI-enabled social bots.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated remarkable
performance across various tasks and have garnered significant attention from
both researchers and practitioners. However, in an educational context, we
still observe a performance gap in generating distractors -- i.e., plausible
yet incorrect answers -- with LLMs for multiple-choice questions (MCQs). In
this study, we propose a strategy for guiding LLMs such as ChatGPT, in
generating relevant distractors by prompting them with question items
automatically retrieved from a question bank as well-chosen in-context
examples. We evaluate our LLM-based solutions using a quantitative assessment
on an existing test set, as well as through quality annotations by human
experts, i.e., teachers. We found that on average 53% of the generated
distractors presented to the teachers were rated as high-quality, i.e.,
suitable for immediate use as is, outperforming the state-of-the-art model. We
also show the gains of our approach 1 in generating high-quality distractors by
comparing it with a zero-shot ChatGPT and a few-shot ChatGPT prompted with
static examples.

<p class="mathjax">The continuous thriving of the Blockchain society motivates research in novel
designs of schemes supporting cryptocurrencies. Previously multiple
Proof-of-Deep-Learning(PoDL) consensuses have been proposed to replace hashing
with useful work such as deep learning model training tasks. The energy will be
more efficiently used while maintaining the ledger. However deep learning
models are problem-specific and can be extremely complex. Current PoDL
consensuses still require much work to realize in the real world. In this
paper, we proposed a novel consensus named
Proof-of-Federated-Learning-Subchain(PoFLSC) to fill the gap. We applied a
subchain to record the training, challenging, and auditing activities and
emphasized the importance of valuable datasets in partner selection. We
simulated 20 miners in the subchain to demonstrate the effectiveness of PoFLSC.
When we reduce the pool size concerning the reservation priority order, the
drop rate difference in the performance in different scenarios further exhibits
that the miner with a higher Shapley Value (SV) will gain a better opportunity
to be selected when the size of the subchain pool is limited. In the conducted
experiments, the PoFLSC consensus supported the subchain manager to be aware of
reservation priority and the core partition of contributors to establish and
maintain a competitive subchain.

uses human ratings to obtain human guidance in reinforcement learning.
Different from the existing preference-based and ranking-based reinforcement
learning paradigms, based on human relative preferences over sample pairs, the
proposed rating-based reinforcement learning approach is based on human
evaluation of individual trajectories without relative comparisons between
sample pairs. The rating-based reinforcement learning approach builds on a new
prediction model for human ratings and a novel multi-class loss function. We
conduct several experimental studies based on synthetic ratings and real human
ratings to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of the new rating-based

<p class="mathjax">Operational constraint violations may occur when deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) agents interact with real-world active distribution systems to learn
their optimal policies during training. This letter presents a universal
distributionally robust safety filter (DRSF) using which any DRL agent can
reduce the constraint violations of distribution systems significantly during
training while maintaining near-optimal solutions. The DRSF is formulated as a
distributionally robust optimization problem with chance constraints of
operational limits. This problem aims to compute near-optimal actions that are
minimally modified from the optimal actions of DRL-based Volt/VAr control by
leveraging the distribution system model, thereby providing constraint
satisfaction guarantee with a probability level under the model uncertainty.
The performance of the proposed DRSF is verified using the IEEE 33-bus and
123-bus systems.

<p class="mathjax">Interleaved training has been studied for single-user and multi-user massive
MIMO downlink with either fully-digital or hybrid beamforming. However, the
impact of channel correlation on its average training overhead is rarely
addressed. In this paper, we explore the channel correlation to improve the
interleaved training for single-user massive MIMO downlink. For the beam-domain
interleaved training, we propose a modified scheme by optimizing the beam
training codebook. The basic antenna-domain interleaved training is also
improved by dynamically adjusting the training order of the base station (BS)
antennas during the training process based on the values of the already trained
channels. Exact and simplified approximate expressions of the average training
length are derived in closed-form for the basic and modified beam-domain
schemes and the basic antenna-domain scheme in correlated channels. For the
modified antenna-domain scheme, a deep neural network (DNN)-based approximation
is provided for fast performance evaluation. Analytical results and simulations
verify the accuracy of our derived training length expressions and explicitly
reveal the impact of system parameters on the average training length. In
addition, the modified beam/antenna-domain schemes are shown to have a shorter
average training length compared to the basic schemes.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a general optimization problem of minimizing a composite
objective functional defined over a class of probability distributions. The
objective is composed of two functionals: one is assumed to possess the
variational representation and the other is expressed in terms of the
expectation operator of a possibly nonsmooth convex regularizer function. Such
a regularized distributional optimization problem widely appears in machine
learning and statistics, such as proximal Monte-Carlo sampling, Bayesian
inference and generative modeling, for regularized estimation and generation.
<br />We propose a novel method, dubbed as Moreau-Yoshida Variational Transport
(MYVT), for solving the regularized distributional optimization problem. First,
as the name suggests, our method employs the Moreau-Yoshida envelope for a
smooth approximation of the nonsmooth function in the objective. Second, we
reformulate the approximate problem as a concave-convex saddle point problem by
leveraging the variational representation, and then develope an efficient
primal-dual algorithm to approximate the saddle point. Furthermore, we provide
theoretical analyses and report experimental results to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Conformal prediction (CP) is a framework to quantify uncertainty of machine
learning classifiers including deep neural networks. Given a testing example
and a trained classifier, CP produces a prediction set of candidate labels with
a user-specified coverage (i.e., true class label is contained with high
probability). Almost all the existing work on CP assumes clean testing data and
there is not much known about the robustness of CP algorithms w.r.t
natural/adversarial perturbations to testing examples. This paper studies the
problem of probabilistically robust conformal prediction (PRCP) which ensures
robustness to most perturbations around clean input examples. PRCP generalizes
the standard CP (cannot handle perturbations) and adversarially robust CP
(ensures robustness w.r.t worst-case perturbations) to achieve better
trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. We propose a novel
adaptive PRCP (aPRCP) algorithm to achieve probabilistically robust coverage.
The key idea behind aPRCP is to determine two parallel thresholds, one for data
samples and another one for the perturbations on data (aka
"quantile-of-quantile" design). We provide theoretical analysis to show that
aPRCP algorithm achieves robust coverage. Our experiments on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using deep neural networks demonstrate that
aPRCP achieves better trade-offs than state-of-the-art CP and adversarially
robust CP algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud recognition are vulnerable to
adversarial examples, threatening their practical deployment. Despite the many
research endeavors have been made to tackle this issue in recent years, the
diversity of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds makes them more
challenging to defend against than those on 2D images. For examples, attackers
can generate adversarial examples by adding, shifting, or removing points.
Consequently, existing defense strategies are hard to counter unseen point
cloud adversarial examples. In this paper, we first establish a comprehensive,
and rigorous point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark to evaluate
adversarial robustness, which can provide a detailed understanding of the
effects of the defense and attack methods. We then collect existing defense
tricks in point cloud adversarial defenses and then perform extensive and
systematic experiments to identify an effective combination of these tricks.
Furthermore, we propose a hybrid training augmentation methods that consider
various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training,
significantly improving the adversarial robustness. By combining these tricks,
we construct a more robust defense framework achieving an average accuracy of
83.45\% against various attacks, demonstrating its capability to enabling
robust learners. Our codebase are open-sourced on:

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in the field of bearing fault
diagnosis. However, this success comes with larger models and more complex
computations, which cannot be transferred into industrial fields requiring
models to be of high speed, strong portability, and low power consumption. In
this paper, we propose a lightweight and deployable model for bearing fault
diagnosis, referred to as BearingPGA-Net, to address these challenges. Firstly,
aided by a well-trained large model, we train BearingPGA-Net via decoupled
knowledge distillation. Despite its small size, our model demonstrates
excellent fault diagnosis performance compared to other lightweight
state-of-the-art methods. Secondly, we design an FPGA acceleration scheme for
BearingPGA-Net using Verilog. This scheme involves the customized quantization
and designing programmable logic gates for each layer of BearingPGA-Net on the
FPGA, with an emphasis on parallel computing and module reuse to enhance the
computational speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance
of deploying a CNN-based bearing fault diagnosis model on an FPGA. Experimental
results reveal that our deployment scheme achieves over 200 times faster
diagnosis speed compared to CPU, while achieving a lower-than-0.4\% performance
drop in terms of F1, Recall, and Precision score on our independently-collected
bearing dataset. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">With their remarkable ability to generate code, large language models (LLMs)
are a transformative technology for computing education practice. They have
created an urgent need for educators to rethink pedagogical approaches and
teaching strategies for newly emerging skill sets. Traditional approaches to
learning programming have focused on frequent and repeated practice at writing
code. The ease with which code can now be generated has resulted in a shift in
focus towards reading, understanding and evaluating LLM-generated code. In
parallel with this shift, a new essential skill is emerging -- the ability to
construct good prompts for code-generating models. This paper introduces a
novel pedagogical concept known as a `Prompt Problem', designed to help
students learn how to craft effective prompts for LLMs. A Prompt Problem
challenges a student to create a natural language prompt that leads an LLM to
produce the correct code for a specific problem. To support the delivery of
Prompt Problems at scale, in this paper we also present a novel tool called
Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and automates the
evaluation of prompt-generated code. We report empirical findings from a field
study in which Promptly was deployed in a first-year Python programming course
(n=54). We explore student interactions with the tool and their perceptions of
the Prompt Problem concept. We found that Promptly was largely well-received by
students for its ability to engage their computational thinking skills and
expose them to new programming constructs. We also discuss avenues for future
work, including variations on the design of Prompt Problems and the need to
study their integration into the curriculum and teaching practice.

<p class="mathjax">Can we better anticipate an actor's future actions (e.g. mix eggs) by knowing
what commonly happens after his/her current action (e.g. crack eggs)? What if
we also know the longer-term goal of the actor (e.g. making egg fried rice)?
The long-term action anticipation (LTA) task aims to predict an actor's future
behavior from video observations in the form of verb and noun sequences, and it
is crucial for human-machine interaction. We propose to formulate the LTA task
from two perspectives: a bottom-up approach that predicts the next actions
autoregressively by modeling temporal dynamics; and a top-down approach that
infers the goal of the actor and plans the needed procedure to accomplish the
goal. We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs), which have been
pretrained on procedure text data (e.g. recipes, how-tos), have the potential
to help LTA from both perspectives. It can help provide the prior knowledge on
the possible next actions, and infer the goal given the observed part of a
procedure, respectively. To leverage the LLMs, we propose a two-stage
framework, AntGPT. It first recognizes the actions already performed in the
observed videos and then asks an LLM to predict the future actions via
conditioned generation, or to infer the goal and plan the whole procedure by
chain-of-thought prompting. Empirical results on the Ego4D LTA v1 and v2
benchmarks, EPIC-Kitchens-55, as well as EGTEA GAZE+ demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. AntGPT achieves state-of-the-art
performance on all above benchmarks, and can successfully infer the goal and
thus perform goal-conditioned "counterfactual" prediction via qualitative
analysis. Code and model will be released at

<p class="mathjax">Document understanding and information extraction include different tasks to
understand a document and extract valuable information automatically. Recently,
there has been a rising demand for developing document understanding among
different domains, including business, law, and medicine, to boost the
efficiency of work that is associated with a large number of documents. This
workshop aims to bring together researchers and industry developers in the
field of document intelligence and understanding diverse document types to
boost automatic document processing and understanding techniques. We also
released a data challenge on the recently introduced document-level VQA
dataset, PDFVQA. The PDFVQA challenge examines the structural and contextual
understandings of proposed models on the natural full document level of
multiple consecutive document pages by including questions with a sequence of
answers extracted from multi-pages of the full document. This task helps to
boost the document understanding step from the single-page level to the full
document level understanding.

present a system, namely MobileVidFactory, to automatically generate vertical

consists of two parts: basic and customized generation. In the basic
generation, we take advantage of the pretrained image diffusion model, and
adapt it to a high-quality open-domain vertical video generator for mobile
devices. As for the audio, by retrieving from our big database, our system
matches a suitable background sound for the video. Additionally to produce
customized content, our system allows users to add specified screen texts to
the video for enriching visual expression, and specify texts for automatic
reading with optional voices as they like.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic music captioning, which generates natural language descriptions for
given music tracks, holds significant potential for enhancing the understanding
and organization of large volumes of musical data. Despite its importance,
researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection
process of existing music-language datasets, which are limited in size. To
address this data scarcity issue, we propose the use of large language models
(LLMs) to artificially generate the description sentences from large-scale tag
datasets. This results in approximately 2.2M captions paired with 0.5M audio
clips. We term it Large Language Model based Pseudo music caption dataset,
shortly, LP-MusicCaps. We conduct a systemic evaluation of the large-scale
music captioning dataset with various quantitative evaluation metrics used in
the field of natural language processing as well as human evaluation. In
addition, we trained a transformer-based music captioning model with the
dataset and evaluated it under zero-shot and transfer-learning settings. The
results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the supervised
baseline model.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models have demonstrated impressive performance in various
domains. However, the prolonged training time of these models remains a
critical problem. Manually designed parallel training strategies could enhance
efficiency but require considerable time and deliver little flexibility. Hence,
automatic parallelism is proposed to automate the parallel strategy searching
process. Even so, existing approaches suffer from sub-optimal strategy space
because they treat automatic parallelism as two independent stages, namely
inter- and intra-layer parallelism. To address this issue, we propose UniAP,
which utilizes mixed integer quadratic programming to unify inter- and
intra-layer automatic parallelism. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the
first work to unify these two categories to search for a globally optimal
strategy. The experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by up to 1.70$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy searching time
by up to 16$\times$ across four Transformer-like models.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of large language models marks a revolutionary breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. With the unprecedented scale of training and model
parameters, the capability of large language models has been dramatically
improved, leading to human-like performances in understanding, language
synthesizing, and common-sense reasoning, etc. Such a major leap-forward in
general AI capacity will change the pattern of how personalization is
conducted. For one thing, it will reform the way of interaction between humans
and personalization systems. Instead of being a passive medium of information
filtering, large language models present the foundation for active user
engagement. On top of such a new foundation, user requests can be proactively
explored, and user's required information can be delivered in a natural and
explainable way. For another thing, it will also considerably expand the scope
of personalization, making it grow from the sole function of collecting
personalized information to the compound function of providing personalized
services. By leveraging large language models as general-purpose interface, the
personalization systems may compile user requests into plans, calls the
functions of external tools to execute the plans, and integrate the tools'
outputs to complete the end-to-end personalization tasks. Today, large language
models are still being developed, whereas the application in personalization is
largely unexplored. Therefore, we consider it to be the right time to review
the challenges in personalization and the opportunities to address them with
LLMs. In particular, we dedicate this perspective paper to the discussion of
the following aspects: the development and challenges for the existing
personalization system, the newly emerged capabilities of large language
models, and the potential ways of making use of large language models for
personalization.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we focus on the problem of 3D human mesh recovery from a
single image under obscured conditions. Most state-of-the-art methods aim to
improve 2D alignment technologies, such as spatial averaging and 2D joint
sampling. However, they tend to neglect the crucial aspect of 3D alignment by
improving 3D representations. Furthermore, recent methods struggle to separate
the target human from occlusion or background in crowded scenes as they
optimize the 3D space of target human with 3D joint coordinates as local
supervision. To address these issues, a desirable method would involve a
framework for fusing 2D and 3D features and a strategy for optimizing the 3D
space globally. Therefore, this paper presents 3D JOint contrastive learning
with TRansformers (JOTR) framework for handling occluded 3D human mesh
recovery. Our method includes an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to
fuse 2D and 3D representations for achieving 2D$\&amp;$3D aligned results in a
coarse-to-fine manner and a novel 3D joint contrastive learning approach for
adding explicitly global supervision for the 3D feature space. The contrastive
learning approach includes two contrastive losses: joint-to-joint contrast for
enhancing the similarity of semantically similar voxels (i.e., human joints),
and joint-to-non-joint contrast for ensuring discrimination from others (e.g.,
occlusions and background). Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on both
occlusion-specific and standard benchmarks, significantly improving the
reconstruction of occluded humans.

central-upwind (PCCU) schemes for the one- (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D)
multifluid systems, whose components are assumed to be immiscible and separated

flux globalization based PCCU framework and they employ the LD central-upwind
(LDCU) numerical fluxes. These fluxes have been recently proposed in [{\sc A.
Kurganov and R. Xin}, J. Sci. Comput., 96 (2023), Paper No. 56] for the
single-fluid compressible Euler equations and we rigorously develop their
multifluid extensions. In order to achieve higher resolution near the material
interfaces, we track their locations and use an overcompressive SBM limiter in
their neighborhoods, while utilizing a dissipative generalized minmod limiter
in the rest of the computational domain. We first develop a second-order
finite-volume LD PCCU scheme and then extend it to the fifth order of accuracy
via the finite-difference alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(A-WENO) framework. We apply the developed schemes to a number of 1-D and 2-D
numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the new schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning practitioners often fine-tune generative pre-trained models
like GPT-3 to improve model performance at specific tasks. Previous works,
however, suggest that fine-tuned machine learning models memorize and emit
sensitive information from the original fine-tuning dataset. Companies such as
OpenAI offer fine-tuning services for their models, but no prior work has
conducted a memorization attack on any closed-source models. In this work, we
simulate a privacy attack on GPT-3 using OpenAI's fine-tuning API. Our
objective is to determine if personally identifiable information (PII) can be
extracted from this model. We (1) explore the use of naive prompting methods on
a GPT-3 fine-tuned classification model, and (2) we design a practical word
generation task called Autocomplete to investigate the extent of PII
memorization in fine-tuned GPT-3 within a real-world context. Our findings
reveal that fine-tuning GPT3 for both tasks led to the model memorizing and
disclosing critical personally identifiable information (PII) obtained from the
underlying fine-tuning dataset. To encourage further research, we have made our

<p class="mathjax">The adaptability of soft robots makes them ideal candidates to maneuver
through unstructured environments. However, locomotion challenges arise due to
complexities in modeling the body mechanics, actuation, and robot-environment
dynamics. These factors contribute to the gap between their potential and
actual autonomous field deployment. A closed-loop path planning framework for
soft robot locomotion is critical to close the real-world realization gap. This
paper presents a generic path planning framework applied to TerreSoRo
(Tetra-Limb Terrestrial Soft Robot) with pose feedback. It employs a
gait-based, lattice trajectory planner to facilitate navigation in the presence
of obstacles. The locomotion gaits are synthesized using a data-driven
optimization approach that allows for learning from the environment. The
trajectory planner employs a greedy breadth-first search strategy to obtain a
collision-free trajectory. The synthesized trajectory is a sequence of
rotate-then-translate gait pairs. The control architecture integrates
high-level and low-level controllers with real-time localization (using an
overhead webcam). TerreSoRo successfully navigates environments with obstacles
where path re-planning is performed. To best of our knowledge, this is the
first instance of real-time, closed-loop path planning of a non-pneumatic soft
robot.

<p class="mathjax">In machine learning, we intuitively adopt an Observation-Oriented principle
where observational variables act as the bedrock for relationships. It may
suffice for conventional models, but with AI's capacities incorporating big
data, it accentuates the misalignment between purely observational models and
our actual comprehension. In contrast, humans construct cognitive entities
indexed through relationships, which are not confined by observations, allowing
us to formulate knowledge across temporal and hyper-dimensional spaces. This
study introduces a novel Relation-Oriented perspective, drawing intuitive
examples from computer vision and health informatics, to redefine our context
of modeling with a causal focus. Furthermore, we present an implementation
method - the relation-defined representation modeling, the feasibility of which
is substantiated through comprehensive experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Activation functions play an essential role in neural networks. They provide
the non-linearity for the networks. Therefore, their properties are important
for neural networks' accuracy and running performance. In this paper, we
present a novel signed and truncated logarithm function as activation function.
The proposed activation function has significantly better mathematical
properties, such as being odd function, monotone, differentiable, having
unbounded value range, and a continuous nonzero gradient. These properties make
it an excellent choice as an activation function. We compare it with other
well-known activation functions in several well-known neural networks. The
results confirm that it is the state-of-the-art. The suggested activation
function can be applied in a large range of neural networks where activation
functions are necessary.

<p class="mathjax">Origami structures have been widely explored in robotics due to their many
potential advantages. Origami robots can be very compact, as well as cheap and
efficient to produce. In particular, they can be constructed in a flat format
using modern manufacturing techniques. Rotational motion is essential for
robotics, and a variety of origami rotational joints have been proposed in the
literature. However, few of these are even approximately flat-foldable. One
potential enabler of flat origami rotational joints is the inclusion of
lightweight pneumatic pouches which actuate the origami's folds; however, pouch
actuators only enable a relatively small amount of rotational displacement. The
previously proposed Four-Vertex Origami is a flat-foldable structure which
provides an angular multiplier for a pouch actuator, but suffers from a
degenerate state. This paper presents a novel rigid origami, the Self-Lock
Origami, which eliminates this degeneracy by slightly relaxing the assumption
of flat-foldability. This joint is analysed in terms of a trade-off between the
angular multiplier and the mechanical advantage. Furthermore, the Self-Lock
Origami is a modular joint which can be connected to similar or different
joints to produce complex movements for various applications; three different
manipulator designs are introduced as a proof of concept.

<p class="mathjax">In recent times there has been a surge of multi-modal architectures based on
Large Language Models, which leverage the zero shot generation capabilities of
LLMs and project image embeddings into the text space and then use the
auto-regressive capacity to solve tasks such as VQA, captioning, and image
retrieval. We name these architectures as "bridge-architectures" as they
project from the image space to the text space. These models deviate from the
traditional recipe of training transformer based multi-modal models, which
involve using large-scale pre-training and complex multi-modal interactions
through co or cross attention. However, the capabilities of bridge
architectures have not been tested on complex visual reasoning tasks which
require fine grained analysis about the image. In this project, we investigate
the performance of these bridge-architectures on the NLVR2 dataset, and compare
it to state-of-the-art transformer based architectures. We first extend the
traditional bridge architectures for the NLVR2 dataset, by adding object level
features to faciliate fine-grained object reasoning. Our analysis shows that
adding object level features to bridge architectures does not help, and that
pre-training on multi-modal data is key for good performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as NLVR2. We also demonstrate some initial results on a
recently bridge-architecture, LLaVA, in the zero shot setting and analyze its
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Search and information retrieval systems are becoming more expressive in
interpreting user queries beyond the traditional weighted bag-of-words model of
document retrieval. For example, searching for a flight status or a game score
returns a dynamically generated response along with supporting, pre-authored
documents contextually relevant to the query. In this paper, we extend this
hybrid search paradigm to data repositories that contain curated data sources
and visualization content. We introduce a semantic search interface, OLIO, that
provides a hybrid set of results comprising both auto-generated visualization
responses and pre-authored charts to blend analytical question-answering with
content discovery search goals. We specifically explore three search scenarios
- question-and-answering, exploratory search, and design search over data
repositories. The interface also provides faceted search support for users to
refine and filter the conventional best-first search results based on
parameters such as author name, time, and chart type. A preliminary user
evaluation of the system demonstrates that OLIO's interface and the hybrid
search paradigm collectively afford greater expressivity in how users discover
insights and visualization content in data repositories.

<p class="mathjax">Stylized visual captioning aims to generate image or video descriptions with
specific styles, making them more attractive and emotionally appropriate. One
major challenge with this task is the lack of paired stylized captions for
visual content, so most existing works focus on unsupervised methods that do
not rely on parallel datasets. However, these approaches still require training
with sufficient examples that have style labels, and the generated captions are
limited to predefined styles. To address these limitations, we explore the
problem of Few-Shot Stylized Visual Captioning, which aims to generate captions
in any desired style, using only a few examples as guidance during inference,
without requiring further training. We propose a framework called FS-StyleCap
for this task, which utilizes a conditional encoder-decoder language model and
a visual projection module. Our two-step training scheme proceeds as follows:
first, we train a style extractor to generate style representations on an
unlabeled text-only corpus. Then, we freeze the extractor and enable our
decoder to generate stylized descriptions based on the extracted style vector
and projected visual content vectors. During inference, our model can generate
desired stylized captions by deriving the style representation from
user-supplied examples. Our automatic evaluation results for few-shot
sentimental visual captioning outperform state-of-the-art approaches and are
comparable to models that are fully trained on labeled style corpora. Human
evaluations further confirm our model s ability to handle multiple styles.

<p class="mathjax">Sub-word segmentation is an essential pre-processing step for Neural Machine
Translation (NMT). Existing work has shown that neural sub-word segmenters are
better than Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), however, they are inefficient as they
require parallel corpora, days to train and hours to decode. This paper
introduces SelfSeg, a self-supervised neural sub-word segmentation method that
is much faster to train/decode and requires only monolingual dictionaries
instead of parallel corpora. SelfSeg takes as input a word in the form of a
partially masked character sequence, optimizes the word generation probability
and generates the segmentation with the maximum posterior probability, which is
calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The training time of SelfSeg
depends on word frequencies, and we explore several word frequency
normalization strategies to accelerate the training phase. Additionally, we
propose a regularization mechanism that allows the segmenter to generate
various segmentations for one word. To show the effectiveness of our approach,
we conduct MT experiments in low-, middle- and high-resource scenarios, where
we compare the performance of using different segmentation methods. The
experimental results demonstrate that on the low-resource ALT dataset, our
method achieves more than 1.2 BLEU score improvement compared with BPE and
SentencePiece, and a 1.1 score improvement over Dynamic Programming Encoding
(DPE) and Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport (VOLT) on average. The
regularization method achieves approximately a 4.3 BLEU score improvement over
BPE and a 1.2 BLEU score improvement over BPE-dropout, the regularized version
of BPE. We also observed significant improvements on IWSLT15 Vi-&gt;En, WMT16
Ro-&gt;En and WMT15 Fi-&gt;En datasets, and competitive results on the WMT14 De-&gt;En
and WMT14 Fr-&gt;En datasets.

(LEO) satellite-terrestrial network. We first derive traffic offloading
probability from the terrestrial network to the LEO satellite network based on
the instantaneous radio signal strength. Then to overcome limited coverage and
also traffic congestion of the terrestrial network, we design an optimal
satellite network in which the minimum number of LEO satellites maximizes the
traffic offloading probability, while probability of a generic LEO satellite
being idle is close to zero. Since the satellite network is optimized regarding
the intensities of the base stations (BSs) and the users, it can control the
terrestrial traffic. Numerical results show that an appropriate number of LEO
satellites overcomes the limited coverage in a region with low intensity of the
BSs and also the traffic congestion by controlling the traffic in a region that
the intensity of the users increases.

<p class="mathjax">An analytical solution for high supersonic flow over a circular cylinder
based on Schneider's inverse method has been presented. In the inverse method,
a shock shape is assumed and the corresponding flow field and the shape of the
body producing the shock are found by integrating the equations of motion using
the stream function. A shock shape theorised by Moeckel has been assumed and it
is optimized by minimising the error between the shape of the body obtained
using Schneider's method and the actual shape of the body. A further
improvement in the shock shape is also found by using the Moeckel's shock shape
in a small series expansion. With this shock shape, the whole flow field in the
shock layer has been calculated using Schneider's method by integrating the
equations of motion. This solution is compared against a fifth order accurate
numerical solution using the discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) and the
maximum error in density is found to be of the order of 0.001 which
demonstrates the accuracy of the method used for both plane and axisymmetric
flows.

<p class="mathjax">Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) is an important pre-processing
technique for text recognition from low-resolution scene images. Nowadays,
various methods have been proposed to extract text-specific information from
high-resolution (HR) images to supervise STISR model training. However, due to
uncontrollable factors (e.g. shooting equipment, focus, and environment) in
manually photographing HR images, the quality of HR images cannot be
guaranteed, which unavoidably impacts STISR performance. Observing the quality
issue of HR images, in this paper we propose a novel idea to boost STISR by
first enhancing the quality of HR images and then using the enhanced HR images
as supervision to do STISR. Concretely, we develop a new STISR framework,
called High-Resolution ENhancement (HiREN) that consists of two branches and a
quality estimation module. The first branch is developed to recover the
low-resolution (LR) images, and the other is an HR quality enhancement branch
aiming at generating high-quality (HQ) text images based on the HR images to
provide more accurate supervision to the LR images. As the degradation from HQ
to HR may be diverse, and there is no pixel-level supervision for HQ image
generation, we design a kernel-guided enhancement network to handle various
degradation, and exploit the feedback from a recognizer and text-level
annotations as weak supervision signal to train the HR enhancement branch.
Then, a quality estimation module is employed to evaluate the qualities of HQ
images, which are used to suppress the erroneous supervision information by
weighting the loss of each image. Extensive experiments on TextZoom show that
HiREN can work well with most existing STISR methods and significantly boost
their performances.

<p class="mathjax">With an excellent balance between speed and accuracy, cutting-edge YOLO
frameworks have become one of the most efficient algorithms for object
detection. However, the performance of using YOLO networks is scarcely
investigated in brain tumor detection. We propose a novel YOLO architecture
with Reparameterized Convolution based on channel Shuffle (RCS-YOLO). We
present RCS and a One-Shot Aggregation of RCS (RCS-OSA), which link feature
cascade and computation efficiency to extract richer information and reduce
time consumption. Experimental results on the brain tumor dataset Br35H show
that the proposed model surpasses YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 in speed and
accuracy. Notably, compared with YOLOv7, the precision of RCS-YOLO improves by
2.6%, and the inference speed by 60% at 114.8 images detected per second (FPS).
Our proposed RCS-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the brain tumor
detection task. The code is available at https://github.com/mkang315/RCS-YOLO.

<p class="mathjax">Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) is a practical yet
challenging task. Due to large-scale datasets, most existing methods use a
network pretrained in other datasets to extract features, which are not
suitable enough for WTAL. To address this problem, researchers design several
modules for feature enhancement, which improve the performance of the
localization module, especially modeling the temporal relationship between
snippets. However, all of them neglect the adverse effects of ambiguous
information, which would reduce the discriminability of others. Considering
this phenomenon, we propose Discriminability-Driven Graph Network (DDG-Net),
which explicitly models ambiguous snippets and discriminative snippets with
well-designed connections, preventing the transmission of ambiguous information
and enhancing the discriminability of snippet-level representations.
Additionally, we propose feature consistency loss to prevent the assimilation
of features and drive the graph convolution network to generate more
discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and
ActivityNet1.2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DDG-Net,
establishing new state-of-the-art results on both datasets. Source code is
available at \url{https://github.com/XiaojunTang22/ICCV2023-DDGNet}.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has achieved remarkable results in fingerprint embedding, which
plays a critical role in modern Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems.
However, previous works including CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches
fail to exploit the nonstructural data, such as topology and correlation in
fingerprints, which is essential to facilitate the identifiability and
robustness of embedding. To address this challenge, we propose a novel paradigm
for fingerprint embedding, called Minutiae Relation-Aware model over Graph
Neural Network (MRA-GNN). Our proposed approach incorporates a GNN-based
framework in fingerprint embedding to encode the topology and correlation of
fingerprints into descriptive features, achieving fingerprint representation in
the form of graph embedding. Specifically, we reinterpret fingerprint data and
their relative connections as vertices and edges respectively, and introduce a
minutia graph and fingerprint graph to represent the topological relations and
correlation structures of fingerprints. We equip MRA-GNN with a Topological
relation Reasoning Module (TRM) and Correlation-Aware Module (CAM) to learn the
fingerprint embedding from these graphs successfully. To tackle the
over-smoothing problem in GNN models, we incorporate Feed-Forward Module and
graph residual connections into proposed modules. The experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
various fingerprint datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our approach in
exploiting nonstructural information of fingerprints.

<p class="mathjax">RAW files are the initial measurement of scene radiance widely used in most
cameras, and the ubiquitously-used RGB images are converted from RAW data
through Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines. Nowadays, digital images are
risky of being nefariously manipulated. Inspired by the fact that innate
immunity is the first line of body defense, we propose DRAW, a novel scheme of
defending images against manipulation by protecting their sources, i.e.,
camera-shooted RAWs. Specifically, we design a lightweight Multi-frequency
Partial Fusion Network (MPF-Net) friendly to devices with limited computing
resources by frequency learning and partial feature fusion. It introduces
invisible watermarks as protective signal into the RAW data. The protection
capability can not only be transferred into the rendered RGB images regardless
of the applied ISP pipeline, but also is resilient to post-processing
operations such as blurring or compression. Once the image is manipulated, we
can accurately identify the forged areas with a localization network. Extensive
experiments on several famous RAW datasets, e.g., RAISE, FiveK and SIDD,
indicate the effectiveness of our method. We hope that this technique can be
used in future cameras as an option for image protection, which could
effectively restrict image manipulation at the source.

<p class="mathjax">An ultimate objective in continual learning is to preserve knowledge learned
in preceding tasks while learning new tasks. To mitigate forgetting prior
knowledge, we propose a novel knowledge distillation technique that takes into
the account the manifold structure of the latent/output space of a neural
network in learning novel tasks. To achieve this, we propose to approximate the
data manifold up-to its first order, hence benefiting from linear subspaces to
model the structure and maintain the knowledge of a neural network while
learning novel concepts. We demonstrate that the modeling with subspaces
provides several intriguing properties, including robustness to noise and
therefore effective for mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in continual
learning. We also discuss and show how our proposed method can be adopted to
address both classification and segmentation problems. Empirically, we observe
that our proposed method outperforms various continual learning methods on
several challenging datasets including Pascal VOC, and Tiny-Imagenet.
Furthermore, we show how the proposed method can be seamlessly combined with
existing learning approaches to improve their performances. The codes of this
article will be available at https://github.com/csiro-robotics/SDCL.

<p class="mathjax">Existing methods for reconstructing interactive scenes primarily focus on
replacing reconstructed objects with CAD models retrieved from a limited
database, resulting in significant discrepancies between the reconstructed and
observed scenes. To address this issue, our work introduces a part-level
reconstruction approach that reassembles objects using primitive shapes. This
enables us to precisely replicate the observed physical scenes and simulate
robot interactions with both rigid and articulated objects. By segmenting
reconstructed objects into semantic parts and aligning primitive shapes to
these parts, we assemble them as CAD models while estimating kinematic
relations, including parent-child contact relations, joint types, and
parameters. Specifically, we derive the optimal primitive alignment by solving
a series of optimization problems, and estimate kinematic relations based on
part semantics and geometry. Our experiments demonstrate that part-level scene
reconstruction outperforms object-level reconstruction by accurately capturing
finer details and improving precision. These reconstructed part-level
interactive scenes provide valuable kinematic information for various robotic
applications; we showcase the feasibility of certifying mobile manipulation
planning in these interactive scenes before executing tasks in the physical
world.

<p class="mathjax">Equipping a deep model the abaility of few-shot learning, i.e., learning
quickly from only few examples, is a core challenge for artificial
intelligence. Gradient-based meta-learning approaches effectively address the
challenge by learning how to learn novel tasks. Its key idea is learning a deep
model in a bi-level optimization manner, where the outer-loop process learns a
shared gradient descent algorithm (i.e., its hyperparameters), while the
inner-loop process leverage it to optimize a task-specific model by using only
few labeled data. Although these existing methods have shown superior
performance, the outer-loop process requires calculating second-order
derivatives along the inner optimization path, which imposes considerable
memory burdens and the risk of vanishing gradients. Drawing inspiration from
recent progress of diffusion models, we find that the inner-loop gradient
descent process can be actually viewed as a reverse process (i.e., denoising)
of diffusion where the target of denoising is model weights but the origin
data. Based on this fact, in this paper, we propose to model the gradient
descent optimizer as a diffusion model and then present a novel
task-conditional diffusion-based meta-learning, called MetaDiff, that
effectively models the optimization process of model weights from Gaussion
noises to target weights in a denoising manner. Thanks to the training
efficiency of diffusion models, our MetaDiff do not need to differentiate
through the inner-loop path such that the memory burdens and the risk of
vanishing gradients can be effectvely alleviated. Experiment results show that
our MetaDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning
family in few-shot learning tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Causal Inference plays an significant role in explaining the decisions taken
by statistical models and artificial intelligence models. Of late, this field
started attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners alike. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of 37 papers published during 1992-2023
and concerning the application of causal inference to banking, finance, and
insurance. The papers are categorized according to the following families of
domains: (i) Banking, (ii) Finance and its subdomains such as corporate
finance, governance finance including financial risk and financial policy,
financial economics, and Behavioral finance, and (iii) Insurance. Further, the
paper covers the primary ingredients of causal inference namely, statistical
methods such as Bayesian Causal Network, Granger Causality and jargon used
thereof such as counterfactuals. The review also recommends some important
directions for future research. In conclusion, we observed that the application
of causal inference in the banking and insurance sectors is still in its
infancy, and thus more research is possible to turn it into a viable method.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection is essential to many perception algorithms used in modern
robotics applications. Unfortunately, the existing models share a tendency to
assign high confidence scores for out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Although
OOD detection has been extensively studied in recent years by the computer
vision (CV) community, most proposed solutions apply only to the image
recognition task. Real-world applications such as perception in autonomous
vehicles struggle with far more complex challenges than classification. In our
work, we focus on the prevalent field of object detection, introducing Neuron
Activation PaTteRns for out-of-distribution samples detection in Object
detectioN (NAPTRON). Performed experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, without the need to affect in-distribution (ID)
performance. By evaluating the methods in two distinct OOD scenarios and three
types of object detectors we have created the largest open-source benchmark for
OOD object detection.

<p class="mathjax">Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of head Computed Tomography (CT) images
elucidates the intricate spatial relationships of tissue structures, thereby
assisting in accurate diagnosis. Nonetheless, securing an optimal head CT scan
without deviation is challenging in clinical settings, owing to poor
positioning by technicians, patient's physical constraints, or CT scanner tilt
angle restrictions. Manual formatting and reconstruction not only introduce
subjectivity but also strain time and labor resources. To address these issues,
we propose an efficient automatic head CT images 3D reconstruction method,
improving accuracy and repeatability, as well as diminishing manual
intervention. Our approach employs a deep learning-based object detection
algorithm, identifying and evaluating orbitomeatal line landmarks to
automatically reformat the images prior to reconstruction. Given the dearth of
existing evaluations of object detection algorithms in the context of head CT
images, we compared ten methods from both theoretical and experimental
perspectives. By exploring their precision, efficiency, and robustness, we
singled out the lightweight YOLOv8 as the aptest algorithm for our task, with
an mAP of 92.91% and impressive robustness against class imbalance. Our
qualitative evaluation of standardized reconstruction results demonstrates the
clinical practicability and validity of our method.

<p class="mathjax">In the last few years, Neural Painting (NP) techniques became capable of
producing extremely realistic artworks. This paper advances the state of the
art in this emerging research domain by proposing the first approach for
Interactive NP. Considering a setting where a user looks at a scene and tries
to reproduce it on a painting, our objective is to develop a computational
framework to assist the users creativity by suggesting the next strokes to
paint, that can be possibly used to complete the artwork. To accomplish such a
task, we propose I-Paint, a novel method based on a conditional transformer
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) architecture with a two-stage decoder. To
evaluate the proposed approach and stimulate research in this area, we also
introduce two novel datasets. Our experiments show that our approach provides
good stroke suggestions and compares favorably to the state of the art.

integers only, because of computation efficiency. Several related results deal
with such constraints by means of re-encrypted controller output, based on
which the controller can be re-constructed and operate over integers. This

data-driven applications (e.g., machine learning and big data) and the acute
desire for secure processing of sensitive data, particularly, across

works accomplished in this emerging area are scattered across various research

software and hardware solutions developed for confidential computing using
trusted execution environments, homomorphic encryption, and secure enclaves. We
underscore the significance of building trust in both hardware and software

applications. While substantial progress has been made, there are some
barely-explored areas that need extra attention from the researchers and
practitioners in the community to improve confidentiality aspects, develop more
robust attestation mechanisms, and to address vulnerabilities of the existing
trusted execution environments. Providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the
confidential computing landscape, this survey enables researchers to advance
this field to ultimately ensure the secure processing of users' sensitive data

{\it acute} semigroups and we prove that they generalize symmetric and

semigroups generated by an interval. For a numerical semigroup
$\Lambda=\{\lambda_0&lt;\lambda_1&lt;\dots\}$ denote
$\nu_i=\#\{j\mid\lambda_i-\lambda_j\in\Lambda\}$. Given an acute numerical

build a video understanding system overcoming the limitations of specific
pre-defined vision tasks. Yet, existing systems can only handle videos with
very few frames. For long videos, the computation complexity, memory cost, and
long-term temporal connection are the remaining challenges. Inspired by

<p class="mathjax">One promising use case of AI assistants is to help with complex procedures
like cooking, home repair, and assembly tasks. Can we teach the assistant to
interject after the user makes a mistake? This paper targets the problem of
identifying ordering mistakes in assembly procedures. We propose a system that
can detect ordering mistakes by utilizing a learned knowledge base. Our
framework constructs a knowledge base with spatial and temporal beliefs based
on observed mistakes. Spatial beliefs depict the topological relationship of
the assembling components, while temporal beliefs aggregate prerequisite
actions as ordering constraints. With an episodic memory design, our algorithm
can dynamically update and construct the belief sets as more actions are
observed, all in an online fashion. We demonstrate experimentally that our
inferred spatial and temporal beliefs are capable of identifying incorrect
orderings in real-world action sequences. To construct the spatial beliefs, we
collect a new set of coarse-level action annotations for Assembly101 based on
the positioning of the toy parts. Finally, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our belief inference algorithm in detecting ordering mistakes on
the Assembly101 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the state of the
art on several natural language processing tasks. However, their accessibility
is often limited to paid API services, posing challenges for researchers in
conducting extensive investigations. On the other hand, while some open-source
models have been proposed by the community, they are typically multilingual and
not specifically tailored for the Italian language. In an effort to democratize
the available and open resources for the Italian language, in this paper we
introduce Camoscio: a language model specifically tuned to follow users'
prompts in Italian. Specifically, we finetuned the smallest variant of LLaMA
(7b) with LoRA on a corpus of instruction prompts translated to Italian via
ChatGPT. Results indicate that the model's zero-shot performance on various
downstream tasks in Italian competes favorably with existing models
specifically finetuned for those tasks. All the artifacts (code, dataset,

<p class="mathjax">Dialogue safety remains a pervasive challenge in open-domain human-machine
interaction. Existing approaches propose distinctive dialogue safety taxonomies
and datasets for detecting explicitly harmful responses. However, these
taxonomies may not be suitable for analyzing response safety in mental health
support. In real-world interactions, a model response deemed acceptable in
casual conversations might have a negligible positive impact on users seeking
mental health support. To address these limitations, this paper aims to develop
a theoretically and factually grounded taxonomy that prioritizes the positive
impact on help-seekers. Additionally, we create a benchmark corpus with
fine-grained labels for each dialogue session to facilitate further research.
We analyze the dataset using popular language models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa-large, and ChatGPT, to detect and understand unsafe responses within
the context of mental health support. Our study reveals that ChatGPT struggles
to detect safety categories with detailed safety definitions in a zero- and
few-shot paradigm, whereas the fine-tuned model proves to be more suitable. The
developed dataset and findings serve as valuable benchmarks for advancing
research on dialogue safety in mental health support, with significant
implications for improving the design and deployment of conversation agents in
real-world applications. We release our code and data here:

<p class="mathjax">The performance of a lifelong learning (L3) model degrades when it is trained
on a series of tasks, as the geometrical formation of the embedding space
changes while learning novel concepts sequentially. The majority of existing L3
approaches operate on a fixed-curvature (e.g., zero-curvature Euclidean) space
that is not necessarily suitable for modeling the complex geometric structure
of data. Furthermore, the distillation strategies apply constraints directly on
low-dimensional embeddings, discouraging the L3 model from learning new
concepts by making the model highly stable. To address the problem, we propose
a distillation strategy named L3DMC that operates on mixed-curvature spaces to
preserve the already-learned knowledge by modeling and maintaining complex
geometrical structures. We propose to embed the projected low dimensional
embedding of fixed-curvature spaces (Euclidean and hyperbolic) to
higher-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using a
positive-definite kernel function to attain rich representation. Afterward, we
optimize the L3 model by minimizing the discrepancies between the new sample
representation and the subspace constructed using the old representation in
RKHS. L3DMC is capable of adapting new knowledge better without forgetting old
knowledge as it combines the representation power of multiple fixed-curvature
spaces and is performed on higher-dimensional RKHS. Thorough experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed distillation
strategy for medical image classification in L3 settings. Our code
implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/csiro-robotics/L3DMC.

<p class="mathjax">Krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems of equations involving
skew-symmetric matrices have gained recent attention. Numerical equivalences
among Krylov subspace methods for nonsingular skew-symmetric linear systems
have been given in Greif et al. [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 37 (2016), pp.
1071--1087]. In this work, we extend the results of Greif et al. to singular
skew-symmetric linear systems. In addition, we systematically study three
Krylov subspace methods (called S$^3$CG, S$^3$MR, and S$^3$LQ) for solving
shifted skew-symmetric linear systems. They all are based on Lanczos
triangularization for skew-symmetric matrices, and correspond to CG, MINRES,
and SYMMLQ for solving symmetric linear systems, respectively. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that studies S$^3$LQ. We give some new
theoretical results on S$^3$CG, S$^3$MR, and S$^3$LQ. We also provide the
relationship among the three methods and those based on Golub--Kahan
bidiagonalization and Saunders--Simon--Yip tridiagonalization. Numerical
examples are given to illustrate our theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">The maximum likelihood principle advocates parameter estimation via
optimization of the data likelihood function. Models estimated in this way can
exhibit a variety of generalization characteristics dictated by, e.g.
architecture, parameterization, and optimization bias. This work addresses
model learning in a setting where there further exists side-information in the
form of an oracle that can label samples as being outside the support of the
true data generating distribution. Specifically we develop a new denoising
diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) methodology, Gen-neG, that leverages
this additional side-information. Our approach builds on generative adversarial
networks (GANs) and discriminator guidance in diffusion models to guide the
generation process towards the positive support region indicated by the oracle.
We empirically establish the utility of Gen-neG in applications including
collision avoidance in self-driving simulators and safety-guarded human motion
generation.

<p class="mathjax">Coordination of radars can be performed in various ways. To be more resilient
radar networks can be coordinated in a decentralized way. In this paper, we
introduce a highly resilient algorithm for radar coordination based on
decentralized and collaborative bundle auctions. We first formalize our problem
as a constrained optimization problem and apply a market-based algorithm to
provide an approximate solution. Our approach allows to track simultaneously
multiple targets, and to use up to two radars tracking the same target to
improve accuracy. We show that our approach performs sensibly as well as a
centralized approach relying on a MIP solver, and depending on the situations,
may outperform it or be outperformed.

within a given frame of reference, which comes to play in many areas of
application that deal with knowledge and information organization. In this
paper, we explore how taxonomy building can be supported with systems that
integrate machine learning (ML). However, relying only on black-boxed ML-based
systems to automate taxonomy building would sideline the users' expertise. We
propose an approach that allows the user to iteratively take into account

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel method for model-free prediction of grasp poses
for suction grippers with multiple suction cups. Our approach is agnostic to
the design of the gripper and does not require gripper-specific training data.
In particular, we propose a two-step approach, where first, a neural network
predicts pixel-wise grasp quality for an input image to indicate areas that are
generally graspable. Second, an optimization step determines the optimal
gripper selection and corresponding grasp poses based on configured gripper
layouts and activation schemes. In addition, we introduce a method for
automated labeling for supervised training of the grasp quality network.
Experimental evaluations on a real-world industrial application with bin
picking scenes of varying difficulty demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

<p class="mathjax">The rise in popularity of text-to-image generative artificial intelligence
(AI) has attracted widespread public interest. At the same time, backdoor
attacks are well-known in machine learning literature for their effective
manipulation of neural models, which is a growing concern among practitioners.
We highlight this threat for generative AI by introducing a Backdoor Attack on
text-to-image Generative Models (BAGM). Our attack targets various stages of
the text-to-image generative pipeline, modifying the behaviour of the embedded
tokenizer and the pre-trained language and visual neural networks. Based on the
penetration level, BAGM takes the form of a suite of attacks that are referred
to as surface, shallow and deep attacks in this article. We compare the
performance of BAGM to recently emerging related methods. We also contribute a
set of quantitative metrics for assessing the performance of backdoor attacks
on generative AI models in the future. The efficacy of the proposed framework
is established by targeting the state-of-the-art stable diffusion pipeline in a
digital marketing scenario as the target domain. To that end, we also
contribute a Marketable Foods dataset of branded product images. We hope this
work contributes towards exposing the contemporary generative AI security
challenges and fosters discussions on preemptive efforts for addressing those
challenges.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used as cost-effective and
flexible Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs) to enhance
Quality of Service (QoS). In disaster management scenarios, UAV-based networks
provide on-demand wireless connectivity when traditional infrastructures fail.
In obstacle-rich environments like urban areas, reliable high-capacity
communications links depend on Line-of-Sight (LoS) availability, especially at
higher frequencies. Positioning UAVs to consider obstacles and enable LoS
communications represents a promising solution that requires further
exploration and development. The main contribution of this paper is the
Traffic- and Obstacle-aware UAV Positioning Algorithm (TOPA). TOPA takes into
account the users' traffic demand and the need for LoS between the UAV and the
ground users in the presence of obstacles. The network performance achieved
when using TOPA was evaluated through ns-3 simulations. The results show up to
100% improvement in the aggregate throughput without compromising fairness.

<p class="mathjax">The classical Minkowski problem for convex bodies has deeply influenced the
development of differential geometry. During the past several decades, abundant
mathematical theories have been developed for studying the solutions of the
Minkowski problem, however, the numerical solution of this problem has been
largely left behind, with only few methods available to achieve that goal. In
this article, focusing on the two-dimensional Minkowski problem with Dirichlet
boundary conditions, we introduce two solution methods, both based on
operator-splitting. One of these two methods deals directly with the Dirichlet
condition, while the other method uses an approximation of this Dirichlet
condition. This relaxation of the Dirichlet condition makes this second method
better suited than the first one to treat those situations where the Minkowski
and the Dirichlet condition are not compatible. Both methods are
generalizations of the solution method for the canonical Monge-Amp\`{e}re
equation discussed by Glowinski et al. (Journal of Scientific Computing, 79(1),
1-47, 2019); as such they take advantage of a divergence formulation of the
Minkowski problem, well-suited to a mixed finite element approximation, and to
the the time-discretization via an operator-splitting scheme, of an associated
initial value problem. Our methodology can be easily implemented on convex
domains of rather general shape (with curved boundaries, possibly). The
numerical experiments we performed validate both methods and show that if one
uses continuous piecewise affine finite element approximations of the smooth
solution of the Minkowski problem and of its three second order derivatives,
these two methods provide nearly second order accuracy for the $L^2$ and
$L^{\infty}$ error. One can extend easily the methods discussed in this
article, to address the solution of three-dimensional Minkowski problem.

problem in robotics due the complex contacts and high-dimensional action space.
In this work, we present a novel method to enable reinforcement learning of
tool use behaviors. Our approach provides a scalable way to learn the operation
of tools in a new category using only a single demonstration. To this end, we
propose a new method for generalizing grasping configurations of multi-fingered
robotic hands to novel objects. This is used to guide the policy search via
favorable initializations and a shaped reward signal. The learned policies
solve complex tool use tasks and generalize to unseen tools at test time.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we study Macro Tree Transducers (MTT), specifically the Linear
Height Increase ("LHI") and Linear input Size to output Height ("LSHI")
constraints. In order to decide whether a Macro tree transducer (MTT) is of LHI
or LSHI, we define a notion of depth-properness: a MTT is depth-proper if, for
each state, there is no bound to the depth at which it places its argument
trees. We show how to effectively put a MTT in depth-proper form. For MTTs in
Depth-proper form, we characterize the LSH property as equivalent to the
finite-nesting property, and we characterize the LHI property as equivalent to
the finiteness of a new type of nesting which we call Multi-Leaf-nesting (or
ML-nesting). As opposed to regular nesting where we look at the nesting of
states applied to a single input node, we count the nesting of states applied
to nodes that are not ancestors of each other. We use this characterization to
give a decision procedure for the LSHI and LHI properties. Finally we consider
the decision problem of the LSOI (Linear input Size to number of distinct
Output subtrees Increase) property. A long standing open problem is whether MTT
of LSOI are as expressive as Attribute Tree Transducers (ATT), in this paper we
show that deciding whether a MTT is of LSOI is as hard as deciding the
equivalence of ATTs.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning is still struggling with solving long-horizon surgical
robot tasks which involve multiple steps over an extended duration of time due
to the policy exploration challenge. Recent methods try to tackle this problem
by skill chaining, in which the long-horizon task is decomposed into multiple
subtasks for easing the exploration burden and subtask policies are temporally
connected to complete the whole long-horizon task. However, smoothly connecting
all subtask policies is difficult for surgical robot scenarios. Not all states
are equally suitable for connecting two adjacent subtasks. An undesired
terminate state of the previous subtask would make the current subtask policy
unstable and result in a failed execution. In this work, we introduce
value-informed skill chaining (ViSkill), a novel reinforcement learning
framework for long-horizon surgical robot tasks. The core idea is to
distinguish which terminal state is suitable for starting all the following
subtask policies. To achieve this target, we introduce a state value function
that estimates the expected success probability of the entire task given a
state. Based on this value function, a chaining policy is learned to instruct
subtask policies to terminate at the state with the highest value so that all
subsequent policies are more likely to be connected for accomplishing the task.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three complex surgical robot
tasks from SurRoL, a comprehensive surgical simulation platform, achieving high
task success rates and execution efficiency. Code is available at
$\href{https://github.com/med-air/ViSkill}{\text{https://github.com/med-air/ViSkill}}$.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling and synthesizing low-light raw noise is a fundamental problem for
computational photography and image processing applications. Although most
recent works have adopted physics-based models to synthesize noise, the
signal-independent noise in low-light conditions is far more complicated and
varies dramatically across camera sensors, which is beyond the description of
these models. To address this issue, we introduce a new perspective to
synthesize the signal-independent noise by a generative model. Specifically, we
synthesize the signal-dependent and signal-independent noise in a physics- and
learning-based manner, respectively. In this way, our method can be considered
as a general model, that is, it can simultaneously learn different noise
characteristics for different ISO levels and generalize to various sensors.
Subsequently, we present an effective multi-scale discriminator termed Fourier
transformer discriminator (FTD) to distinguish the noise distribution
accurately. Additionally, we collect a new low-light raw denoising (LRD)
dataset for training and benchmarking. Qualitative validation shows that the
noise generated by our proposed noise model can be highly similar to the real
noise in terms of distribution. Furthermore, extensive denoising experiments
demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods
on different sensors. The source code and dataset can be found at
~\url{https://github.com/fengzhang427/LRD}.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the domain differences and unbalanced disparity distribution across
multiple datasets, current stereo matching approaches are commonly limited to a
specific dataset and generalize poorly to others. Such domain shift issue is
usually addressed by substantial adaptation on costly target-domain
ground-truth data, which cannot be easily obtained in practical settings. In
this paper, we propose to dig into uncertainty estimation for robust stereo
matching. Specifically, to balance the disparity distribution, we employ a
pixel-level uncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage
disparity searching space, in this way driving the network progressively prune
out the space of unlikely correspondences. Then, to solve the limited ground
truth data, an uncertainty-based pseudo-label is proposed to adapt the
pre-trained model to the new domain, where pixel-level and area-level
uncertainty estimation are proposed to filter out the high-uncertainty pixels
of predicted disparity maps and generate sparse while reliable pseudo-labels to
align the domain gap. Experimentally, our method shows strong cross-domain,
adapt, and joint generalization and obtains \textbf{1st} place on the stereo
task of Robust Vision Challenge 2020. Additionally, our uncertainty-based
pseudo-labels can be extended to train monocular depth estimation networks in
an unsupervised way and even achieves comparable performance with the
supervised methods. The code will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Annotating costs of large corpora are still one of the main bottlenecks in
empirical social science research. On the one hand, making use of the
capabilities of domain transfer allows re-using annotated data sets and trained
models. On the other hand, it is not clear how well domain transfer works and
how reliable the results are for transfer across different dimensions. We
explore the potential of domain transfer across geographical locations,
languages, time, and genre in a large-scale database of political manifestos.
First, we show the strong within-domain classification performance of
fine-tuned transformer models. Second, we vary the genre of the test set across
the aforementioned dimensions to test for the fine-tuned models' robustness and
transferability. For switching genres, we use an external corpus of transcribed
speeches from New Zealand politicians while for the other three dimensions,
custom splits of the Manifesto database are used. While BERT achieves the best
scores in the initial experiments across modalities, DistilBERT proves to be
competitive at a lower computational expense and is thus used for further
experiments across time and country. The results of the additional analysis
show that (Distil)BERT can be applied to future data with similar performance.
Moreover, we observe (partly) notable differences between the political
manifestos of different countries of origin, even if these countries share a
language or a cultural background.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) are currently at the forefront of intertwining
artificial intelligence (AI) systems with human communication and everyday
life. Thus, aligning them with human values is of great importance. However,
given the steady increase in reasoning abilities, future LLMs are under
suspicion of becoming able to deceive human operators and utilizing this
ability to bypass monitoring efforts. As a prerequisite to this, LLMs need to
possess a conceptual understanding of deception strategies. This study reveals
that such strategies emerged in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, but were
non-existent in earlier LLMs. We conduct a series of experiments showing that
state-of-the-art LLMs are able to understand and induce false beliefs in other
agents, that their performance in complex deception scenarios can be amplified
utilizing chain-of-thought reasoning, and that eliciting Machiavellianism in
LLMs can alter their propensity to deceive. In sum, revealing hitherto unknown
machine behavior in LLMs, our study contributes to the nascent field of machine
psychology.

<p class="mathjax">This work proposes a neural network to extensively exploit spatial
information for multichannel joint speech separation, denoising and
dereverberation, named SpatialNet.In the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
domain, the proposed network performs end-to-end speech enhancement. It is
mainly composed of interleaved narrow-band and cross-band blocks to
respectively exploit narrow-band and cross-band spatial information. The
narrow-band blocks process frequencies independently, and use self-attention
mechanism and temporal convolutional layers to respectively perform
spatial-feature-based speaker clustering and temporal smoothing/filtering. The
cross-band blocks processes frames independently, and use full-band linear
layer and frequency convolutional layers to respectively learn the correlation
between all frequencies and adjacent frequencies. Experiments are conducted on
various simulated and real datasets, and the results show that 1) the proposed
network achieves the state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks; 2) the
proposed network suffers little from the spectral generalization problem; and
3) the proposed network is indeed performing speaker clustering (demonstrated
by attention maps).

<p class="mathjax">Collaboration by the sharing of semantic information is crucial to enable the
enhancement of perception capabilities. However, existing collaborative
perception methods tend to focus solely on the spatial features of semantic
information, while neglecting the importance of the temporal dimension in
collaborator selection and semantic information fusion, which instigates
performance degradation. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative
perception framework, IoSI-CP, which takes into account the importance of
semantic information (IoSI) from both temporal and spatial dimensions.
Specifically, we develop an IoSI-based collaborator selection method that
effectively identifies advantageous collaborators but excludes those that bring
negative benefits. Moreover, we present a semantic information fusion algorithm
called HPHA (historical prior hybrid attention), which integrates a multi-scale
transformer module and a short-term attention module to capture IoSI from
spatial and temporal dimensions, and assigns varying weights for efficient
aggregation. Extensive experiments on two open datasets demonstrate that our
proposed IoSI-CP significantly improves the perception performance compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The code associated with this research is publicly

<p class="mathjax">Channel prediction is critical to address the channel aging issue in mobile
scenarios. Existing channel prediction techniques are mainly designed for
discrete channel prediction, which can only predict the future channel in a
fixed time slot per frame, while the other intra-frame channels are usually
recovered by interpolation. However, these approaches suffer from a serious
interpolation loss, especially for mobile millimeter wave communications. To
solve this challenging problem, we propose a tensor neural ordinary
differential equation (TN-ODE) based continuous-time channel prediction scheme
to realize the direct prediction of intra-frame channels. Specifically,
inspired by the recently developed continuous mapping model named neural ODE in
the field of machine learning, we first utilize the neural ODE model to predict
future continuous-time channels. To improve the channel prediction accuracy and
reduce computational complexity, we then propose the TN-ODE scheme to learn the
structural characteristics of the high-dimensional channel by low dimensional
learnable transform. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able
to achieve higher intra-frame channel prediction accuracy than existing
schemes.

<p class="mathjax">We propose different ways of lifting the notion of Dyck language from words
to 2-dimensional (2D) pictures, by means of new definitions of increasing
comprehensiveness. Two of the proposals are based on alternative definitions of
a Dyck language, which are equivalent over words but not on pictures. First,
the property that any two pairs of matching parentheses are well-nested or
disjoint is rephrased for rectangular boxes and leads to the well-nested Dyck,
$DW_k$. This is a generalization of the known Chinese box language, but, unlike
the Chinese boxes, $DW_k$ is not recognizable by a tiling system. Second, the
Dyck cancellation rule is rephrased as a neutralization rule, mapping a
quadruple of symbols representing the corners of a subpicture onto neutral
symbols.The neutralizable Dyck language $DN_k$ is obtained by iterating
neutralizations, starting from 2-by-2 subpictures, until the picture is wholly
neutralized. Third, we define the Dyck crossword $DC_k$ as the row-column
combination of Dyck word languages, which prescribes that each column and row
is a Dyck word. The relation between matching parentheses is represented in
$DC_k$ by an edge of a graph situated on the picture grid. Such edges form a
circuit, of path length multiple of four, of alternating row and column
matches. Length-four circuits have rectangular shape, while longer ones exhibit
a large variety of forms. A proper subset of $DC_k$, called quaternate, is also
introduced by excluding all circuits of length greater than 4. We prove that
$DN_k$ properly includes $DW_k$, and that it coincides with the quaternate
$DC_k$ such that the neutralizability relation between subpictures induces a
partial order. The 2D languages well-nested, neutralizable, quaternate and Dyck
crossword are ordered by strict inclusions. This work can be also seen as a
first step towards the definition of context-free picture languages.

<p class="mathjax">With the continuous advancement of robot teleoperation technology, shared
control is used to reduce the physical and mental load of the operator in
teleoperation system. This paper proposes an alternating shared control
framework for object grasping that considers both operator's preferences
through their manual manipulation and the constraints of the follower robot.
The switching between manual mode and automatic mode enables the operator to
intervene the task according to their wishes. The generation of the grasping
pose takes into account the current state of the operator's hand pose, as well
as the manipulability of the robot. The object grasping experiment indicates
that the use of the proposed grasping pose selection strategy leads to smoother
follower movements when switching from manual mode to automatic mode.

<p class="mathjax">Image-to-text generation aims to describe images using natural language.
Recently, zero-shot image captioning based on pre-trained vision-language
models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has made significant progress.
However, we have observed and empirically demonstrated that these methods are
susceptible to modality bias induced by LLMs and tend to generate descriptions
containing objects (entities) that do not actually exist in the image but
frequently appear during training (i.e., object hallucination). In this paper,
we propose ViECap, a transferable decoding model that leverages entity-aware
decoding to generate descriptions in both seen and unseen scenarios. ViECap
incorporates entity-aware hard prompts to guide LLMs' attention toward the
visual entities present in the image, enabling coherent caption generation
across diverse scenes. With entity-aware hard prompts, ViECap is capable of
maintaining performance when transferring from in-domain to out-of-domain
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViECap sets a new
state-of-the-art cross-domain (transferable) captioning and performs
competitively in-domain captioning compared to previous VLMs-based zero-shot
methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/FeiElysia/ViECap

<p class="mathjax">As machine learning methods gain prominence within clinical decision-making,
addressing fairness concerns becomes increasingly urgent. Despite considerable
work dedicated to detecting and ameliorating algorithmic bias, today's methods
are deficient with potentially harmful consequences. Our causal perspective
sheds new light on algorithmic bias, highlighting how different sources of
dataset bias may appear indistinguishable yet require substantially different
mitigation strategies. We introduce three families of causal bias mechanisms
stemming from disparities in prevalence, presentation, and annotation. Our
causal analysis underscores how current mitigation methods tackle only a narrow
and often unrealistic subset of scenarios. We provide a practical three-step
framework for reasoning about fairness in medical imaging, supporting the
development of safe and equitable AI prediction models.

<p class="mathjax">Radar is ubiquitous in autonomous driving systems due to its low cost and
good adaptability to bad weather. Nevertheless, the radar detection performance
is usually inferior because its point cloud is sparse and not accurate due to
the poor azimuth and elevation resolution. Moreover, point cloud generation
algorithms already drop weak signals to reduce the false targets which may be
suboptimal for the use of deep fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel method
named EchoFusion to skip the existing radar signal processing pipeline and then
incorporate the radar raw data with other sensors. Specifically, we first
generate the Bird's Eye View (BEV) queries and then take corresponding spectrum
features from radar to fuse with other sensors. By this approach, our method
could utilize both rich and lossless distance and speed clues from radar echoes
and rich semantic clues from images, making our method surpass all existing
methods on the RADIal dataset, and approach the performance of LiDAR. Codes
will be available upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Cybersecurity is an important topic which is often viewed as one that is
inaccessible due to steep learning curves and a perceived requirement of
needing specialist knowledge. With a constantly changing threat landscape,
practical solutions such as best-practices are employed, but the number of
critical cybersecurity-related incidents remains high. To address these
concerns, the National Cyber Security Centre published a Cybersecurity Body of
Knowledge (CyBOK) to provide a comprehensive information base used to advise
and underpin cybersecurity learning. Unfortunately, CyBOK contains over 1000
pages of in-depth material and may not be easy to navigate for novice
individuals. Furthermore, it does not allow for easy expression of various
cybersecurity scenarios that such individuals may be exposed to. As a solution
to these two issues, we propose the use of a playing cards format to provide
introductory cybersecurity knowledge that supports learning and discussion,
using CyBOK as the foundation for the technical content. Upon evaluation in two
user studies, we found that 80% of the participants agreed the cards provided
them with introductory knowledge of cybersecurity topics, and 70% agreed the
cards provided an interface for discussing topics and enabled them to make
links between attacks, vulnerabilities and defences.

<p class="mathjax">In previous work, summarized in this paper, we proposed an operation of
parallel composition for rewriting-logic theories, allowing compositional
specification of systems and reusability of components. The present paper
focuses on compositional verification. We show how the assume/guarantee
technique can be transposed to our setting, by giving appropriate definitions
of satisfaction based on transition structures and path semantics. We also show
that simulation and equational abstraction can be done componentwise.
Appropriate concepts of fairness and deadlock for our composition operation are
discussed, as they affect satisfaction of temporal formulas. We keep in
parallel a distributed and a global view of composed systems. We show that
these views are equivalent and interchangeable, which may help our intuition
and also has practical uses as, for example, it allows global-style
verification of a modularly specified system.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of worst-case optimal join algorithms depends on the order in
which the join attributes are processed. Selecting good orders before query
execution is hard, due to the large space of possible orders and unreliable
execution cost estimates in case of data skew or data correlation. We propose
ADOPT, a query engine that combines adaptive query processing with a worst-case
optimal join algorithm, which uses an order on the join attributes instead of a
join order on relations. ADOPT divides query execution into episodes in which
different attribute orders are tried. Based on run time feedback on attribute
order performance, ADOPT converges quickly to near-optimal orders. It avoids
redundant work across different orders via a novel data structure, keeping
track of parts of the join input that have been successfully processed. It
selects attribute orders to try via reinforcement learning, balancing the need
for exploring new orders with the desire to exploit promising orders. In
experiments with various data sets and queries, it outperforms baselines,
including commercial and open-source systems using worst-case optimal join
algorithms, whenever queries become complex and therefore difficult to
optimize.

<p class="mathjax">The recent spread of cloud services has enabled many companies to take
advantage of them. Nevertheless, the main concern about the adoption of cloud
services remains the lack of transparency perceived by customers regarding
security and privacy. To overcome this issue, Cloud Service Certifications
(CSCs) have emerged as an effective solution to increase the level of trust in
cloud services, possibly based on continuous auditing to monitor and evaluate
the security of cloud services on an ongoing basis. Continuous auditing can be
easily implemented for technical aspects, while organizational aspects can be
challenging due to their generic nature and varying policies between service
providers. In this paper, we propose an approach to facilitate the automatic
assessment of organizational evidence, such as that extracted from security
policy documents. The evidence extraction process is based on Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques, in particular on Question Answering (QA). The
implemented prototype provides promising results on an annotated dataset, since
it is capable to retrieve the correct answer for more than half of the tested
metrics. This prototype can be helpful for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to
automate the auditing of textual policy documents and to help in reducing the
time required by auditors to check policy documents.

<p class="mathjax">For driver observation frameworks, clean datasets collected in controlled
simulated environments often serve as the initial training ground. Yet, when
deployed under real driving conditions, such simulator-trained models quickly
face the problem of distributional shifts brought about by changing
illumination, car model, variations in subject appearances, sensor
discrepancies, and other environmental alterations.
<br />This paper investigates the viability of transferring video-based driver
observation models from simulation to real-world scenarios in autonomous
vehicles, given the frequent use of simulation data in this domain due to
safety issues. To achieve this, we record a dataset featuring actual autonomous
driving conditions and involving seven participants engaged in highly
distracting secondary activities. To enable direct SIM to REAL transfer, our
dataset was designed in accordance with an existing large-scale simulator
dataset used as the training source. We utilize the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D)
model, a popular choice for driver observation, with Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for detailed analysis of model decision-making.
Though the simulator-based model clearly surpasses the random baseline, its
recognition quality diminishes, with average accuracy dropping from 85.7% to
46.6%. We also observe strong variations across different behavior classes.
This underscores the challenges of model transferability, facilitating our
research of more robust driver observation systems capable of dealing with real
driving conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Businesses have sought out new solutions to provide support and improve
customer satisfaction as more products and services have become interconnected
digitally. There is an inherent need for businesses to provide or outsource
fast, efficient and knowledgeable support to remain competitive. Support
solutions are also advancing with technologies, including use of social media,
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and remote device
connectivity to better support customers. Customer support operators are
trained to utilise these technologies to provide better customer outreach and
support for clients in remote areas. Interconnectivity of products and support
systems provide businesses with potential international clients to expand their
product market and business scale. This paper reports the possible AI
applications in customer support, done in collaboration with the Knowledge
Transfer Partnership (KTP) program between Birmingham City University and a
company that handles customer service systems for businesses outsourcing
customer support across a wide variety of business sectors. This study explored
several approaches to accurately predict customers' intent using both labelled
and unlabelled textual data. While some approaches showed promise in specific
datasets, the search for a single, universally applicable approach continues.
The development of separate pipelines for intent detection and discovery has
led to improved accuracy rates in detecting known intents, while further work
is required to improve the accuracy of intent discovery for unknown intents.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfakes are realistic face manipulations that can pose serious threats to
security, privacy, and trust. Existing methods mostly treat this task as binary
classification, which uses digital labels or mask signals to train the
detection model. We argue that such supervisions lack semantic information and
interpretability. To address this issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
paradigm named Visual-Linguistic Face Forgery Detection(VLFFD), which uses
fine-grained sentence-level prompts as the annotation. Since text annotations
are not available in current deepfakes datasets, VLFFD first generates the
mixed forgery image with corresponding fine-grained prompts via Prompt Forgery
Image Generator (PFIG). Then, the fine-grained mixed data and coarse-grained
original data and is jointly trained with the Coarse-and-Fine Co-training
framework (C2F), enabling the model to gain more generalization and
interpretability. The experiments show the proposed method improves the
existing detection models on several challenging benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Expressive text-to-speech systems have undergone significant advancements
owing to prosody modeling, but conventional methods can still be improved.
Traditional approaches have relied on the autoregressive method to predict the
quantized prosody vector; however, it suffers from the issues of long-term
dependency and slow inference. This study proposes a novel approach called
DiffProsody in which expressive speech is synthesized using a diffusion-based
latent prosody generator and prosody conditional adversarial training. Our
findings confirm the effectiveness of our prosody generator in generating a
prosody vector. Furthermore, our prosody conditional discriminator
significantly improves the quality of the generated speech by accurately
emulating prosody. We use denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks
to improve the prosody generation speed. Consequently, DiffProsody is capable
of generating prosody 16 times faster than the conventional diffusion model.
The superior performance of our proposed method has been demonstrated via
experiments.

<p class="mathjax">The video frame interpolation (VFI) model applies the convolution operation
to all locations, leading to redundant computations in regions with easy
motion. We can use dynamic spatial pruning method to skip redundant
computation, but this method cannot properly identify easy regions in VFI tasks
without supervision. In this paper, we develop an Uncertainty-Guided Spatial
Pruning (UGSP) architecture to skip redundant computation for efficient frame
interpolation dynamically. Specifically, pixels with low uncertainty indicate
easy regions, where the calculation can be reduced without bringing undesirable
visual results. Therefore, we utilize uncertainty-generated mask labels to
guide our UGSP in properly locating the easy region. Furthermore, we propose a
self-contrast training strategy that leverages an auxiliary non-pruning branch
to improve the performance of our UGSP. Extensive experiments show that UGSP
maintains performance but reduces FLOPs by 34%/52%/30% compared to baseline
without pruning on Vimeo90K/UCF101/MiddleBury datasets. In addition, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower FLOPs on multiple benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have shown increased cyber attacks targeting less secure
elements in the software supply chain and causing fatal damage to businesses
and organizations. Past well-known examples of software supply chain attacks
are the SolarWinds or log4j incidents that have affected thousands of customers
and businesses. The US government and industry are equally interested in
enhancing software supply chain security. On February 22, 2023, researchers
from the NSF-supported Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a
Secure Software Supply Chain Summit with a diverse set of 17 practitioners from
15 companies. The goal of the Summit is to enable sharing between industry
practitioners having practical experiences and challenges with software supply
chain security and helping to form new collaborations. We conducted six-panel
discussions based upon open-ended questions regarding software bill of
materials (SBOMs), malicious commits, choosing new dependencies, build and
deploy,the Executive Order 14028, and vulnerable dependencies. The open
discussions enabled mutual sharing and shed light on common challenges that
industry practitioners with practical experience face when securing their
software supply chain. In this paper, we provide a summary of the Summit. Full
panel questions can be found in the appendix.

<p class="mathjax">We define a notion of grading of a monoid T in a monoidal category C,
relative to a class of morphisms M (which provide a notion of M-subobject). We
show that, under reasonable conditions (including that M forms a factorization
system), there is a canonical grading of T. Our application is to graded monads
and models of computational effects. We demonstrate our results by
characterizing the canonical gradings of a number of monads, for which C is
endofunctors with composition. We also show that we can obtain canonical grades
for algebraic operations.

<p class="mathjax">Large AI models (e.g., Dall-E, GPT4) have electrified the scientific,
technological and societal landscape through their superhuman capabilities.
These services are offered largely in a traditional web2.0 format (e.g.,
OpenAI's GPT4 service). As more large AI models proliferate (personalizing and
specializing to a variety of domains), there is a tremendous need to have a
neutral trust-free platform that allows the hosting of AI models, clients
receiving AI services efficiently, yet in a trust-free, incentive compatible,
Byzantine behavior resistant manner. In this paper we propose SAKSHI, a
trust-free decentralized platform specifically suited for AI services. The key
design principles of SAKSHI are the separation of the data path (where AI query
and service is managed) and the control path (where routers and compute and
storage hosts are managed) from the transaction path (where the metering and
billing of services are managed over a blockchain). This separation is enabled
by a "proof of inference" layer which provides cryptographic resistance against
a variety of misbehaviors, including poor AI service, nonpayment for service,
copying of AI models. This is joint work between multiple universities
(Princeton University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Tsinghua
University, HKUST) and two startup companies (Witness Chain and Eigen Layer).

<p class="mathjax">Video portrait segmentation (VPS), aiming at segmenting prominent foreground
portraits from video frames, has received much attention in recent years.
However, simplicity of existing VPS datasets leads to a limitation on extensive
research of the task. In this work, we propose a new intricate large-scale
Multi-scene Video Portrait Segmentation dataset MVPS consisting of 101 video
clips in 7 scenario categories, in which 10,843 sampled frames are finely
annotated at pixel level. The dataset has diverse scenes and complicated
background environments, which is the most complex dataset in VPS to our best
knowledge. Through the observation of a large number of videos with portraits
during dataset construction, we find that due to the joint structure of human
body, motion of portraits is part-associated, which leads that different parts
are relatively independent in motion. That is, motion of different parts of the
portraits is unbalanced. Towards this unbalance, an intuitive and reasonable
idea is that different motion states in portraits can be better exploited by
decoupling the portraits into parts. To achieve this, we propose a
Part-Decoupling Network (PDNet) for video portrait segmentation. Specifically,
an Inter-frame Part-Discriminated Attention (IPDA) module is proposed which
unsupervisely segments portrait into parts and utilizes different attentiveness
on discriminative features specified to each different part. In this way,
appropriate attention can be imposed to portrait parts with unbalanced motion
to extract part-discriminated correlations, so that the portraits can be
segmented more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves leading performance with the comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation models are known vulnerable to small input
perturbations. In this paper, we comprehensively analysis the performance of
semantic segmentation models \wrt~adversarial attacks, and observe that the
adversarial examples generated from a source model fail to attack the target
models, \ie~the conventional attack methods, such as PGD and FGSM, do not
transfer well to target models, making it necessary to study the transferable
attacks, especially transferable attacks for semantic segmentation. We find
that to achieve transferable attack, the attack should come with effective data
augmentation and translation-invariant features to deal with unseen models, and
stabilized optimization strategies to find the optimal attack direction. Based
on the above observations, we propose an ensemble attack for semantic
segmentation by aggregating several transferable attacks from classification to
achieve more effective attacks with higher transferability. The source code and
experimental results are publicly available via our project page:

<p class="mathjax">Cultural heritage is an arena of international relations that interests all
states worldwide. The inscription process on the UNESCO World Heritage List and
the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity
often leads to tensions and conflicts among states. This research addresses
these challenges by developing automatic tools that provide valuable insights
into the decision-making processes regarding inscriptions to the two lists
mentioned above. We propose innovative topic modelling and tension detection
methods based on UNESCO's summary records. Our analysis achieved a commendable
accuracy rate of 72% in identifying tensions. Furthermore, we have developed an
application tailored for diplomats, lawyers, political scientists, and
international relations researchers that facilitates the efficient search of
paragraphs from selected documents and statements from specific speakers about
chosen topics. This application is a valuable resource for enhancing the
understanding of complex decision-making dynamics within international heritage
inscription procedures.

<p class="mathjax">The present study aims to explore the feasibility of language translation
using quantum natural language processing algorithms on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Classical methods in natural
language processing (NLP) struggle with handling large-scale computations
required for complex language tasks, but quantum NLP on NISQ devices holds
promise in harnessing quantum parallelism and entanglement to efficiently
process and analyze vast amounts of linguistic data, potentially
revolutionizing NLP applications. Our research endeavors to pave the way for
quantum neural machine translation, which could potentially offer advantages
over classical methods in the future. We employ Shannon entropy to demonstrate
the significant role of some appropriate angles of rotation gates in the
performance of parametrized quantum circuits. In particular, we utilize these
angles (parameters) as a means of communication between quantum circuits of
different languages. To achieve our objective, we adopt the encoder-decoder
model of classical neural networks and implement the translation task using
long short-term memory (LSTM). Our experiments involved 160 samples comprising
English sentences and their Persian translations. We trained the models with
different optimisers implementing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as primary
and subsequently incorporating two additional optimizers in conjunction with
SGD. Notably, we achieved optimal results-with mean absolute error of 0.03,
mean squared error of 0.002, and 0.016 loss-by training the best model,
consisting of two LSTM layers and using the Adam optimiser. Our small dataset,
though consisting of simple synonymous sentences with word-to-word mappings,
points to the utility of Shannon entropy as a figure of merit in more complex
machine translation models for intricate sentence structures.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a latent diffusion model with contrastive learning for
audio-visual segmentation (AVS) to extensively explore the contribution of
audio. We interpret AVS as a conditional generation task, where audio is
defined as the conditional variable for sound producer(s) segmentation. With
our new interpretation, it is especially necessary to model the correlation
between audio and the final segmentation map to ensure its contribution. We
introduce a latent diffusion model to our framework to achieve
semantic-correlated representation learning. Specifically, our diffusion model
learns the conditional generation process of the ground-truth segmentation map,
leading to ground-truth aware inference when we perform the denoising process
at the test stage. As a conditional diffusion model, we argue it is essential
to ensure that the conditional variable contributes to model output. We then
introduce contrastive learning to our framework to learn audio-visual
correspondence, which is proven consistent with maximizing the mutual
information between model prediction and the audio data. In this way, our
latent diffusion model via contrastive learning explicitly maximizes the
contribution of audio for AVS. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset
verify the effectiveness of our solution. Code and results are online via our
project page: https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/DiffusionAVS.

<p class="mathjax">This article introduces a new Neural Network stochastic model to generate a
1-dimensional stochastic field with turbulent velocity statistics. Both the
model architecture and training procedure ground on the Kolmogorov and Obukhov
statistical theories of fully developed turbulence, so guaranteeing
descriptions of 1) energy distribution, 2) energy cascade and 3) intermittency
across scales in agreement with experimental observations. The model is a
Generative Adversarial Network with multiple multiscale optimization criteria.
First, we use three physics-based criteria: the variance, skewness and flatness
of the increments of the generated field that retrieve respectively the
turbulent energy distribution, energy cascade and intermittency across scales.
Second, the Generative Adversarial Network criterion, based on reproducing
statistical distributions, is used on segments of different length of the
generated field. Furthermore, to mimic multiscale decompositions frequently
used in turbulence's studies, the model architecture is fully convolutional
with kernel sizes varying along the multiple layers of the model. To train our
model we use turbulent velocity signals from grid turbulence at Modane wind
tunnel.

<p class="mathjax">Video-to-speech synthesis involves reconstructing the speech signal of a
speaker from a silent video. The implicit assumption of this task is that the
sound signal is either missing or contains a high amount of noise/corruption
such that it is not useful for processing. Previous works in the literature
either use video inputs only or employ both video and audio inputs during
training, and discard the input audio pathway during inference. In this work we
investigate the effect of using video and audio inputs for video-to-speech
synthesis during both training and inference. In particular, we use pre-trained
video-to-speech models to synthesize the missing speech signals and then train
an audio-visual-to-speech synthesis model, using both the silent video and the
synthesized speech as inputs, to predict the final reconstructed speech. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach is successful with both raw
waveforms and mel spectrograms as target outputs.

<p class="mathjax">Network slicing (NS) is a key technology in 5G networks that enables the
customization and efficient sharing of network resources to support the diverse
requirements of nextgeneration services. This paper proposes a resource
allocation scheme for NS based on the Fisher-market model and the Trading-post
mechanism. The scheme aims to achieve efficient resource utilization while
ensuring multi-level fairness, dynamic load conditions, and the protection of
service level agreements (SLAs) for slice tenants. In the proposed scheme, each
service provider (SP) is allocated a budget representing its infrastructure
share or purchasing power in the market. SPs acquire different resources by
spending their budgets to offer services to different classes of users,
classified based on their service needs and priorities. The scheme assumes that
SPs employ the $\alpha$-fairness criteria to deliver services to their
subscribers. The resource allocation problem is formulated as a convex
optimization problem to find a market equilibrium (ME) solution that provides
allocation and resource pricing. A privacy-preserving learning algorithm is
developed to enable SPs to reach the ME in a decentralized manner. The
performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through theoretical analysis
and extensive numerical simulations, comparing it with the Social Optimal and
Static Proportional sharing schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Optical flow estimation aims to find the 2D dense motion field between two
frames. Due to the limitation of model structures and training datasets,
existing methods often rely too much on local clues and ignore the integrity of
objects, resulting in fragmented motion estimation. We notice that the recently
famous Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates a strong ability to segment
complete objects, which is suitable for solving the fragmentation problem in
optical flow estimation. We thus propose a solution to embed the frozen SAM
image encoder into FlowFormer to enhance object perception. To address the
challenge of in-depth utilizing SAM in non-segmentation tasks like optical flow
estimation, we propose an Optical Flow Task-Specific Adaption scheme, including
a Context Fusion Module to fuse the SAM encoder with the optical flow context
encoder, and a Context Adaption Module to adapt the SAM features for optical
flow task with Learned Task-Specific Embedding. Our proposed SAMFlow model
reaches 0.86/2.10 clean/final EPE and 3.55/12.32 EPE/F1-all on Sintel and
KITTI-15 training set, surpassing Flowformer by 8.5%/9.9% and 13.2%/16.3%.
Furthermore, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Sintel and
KITTI-15 benchmarks, ranking #1 among all two-frame methods on Sintel clean
pass.

<p class="mathjax">Accessibility in visualization is an important yet challenging topic.
Sonification, in particular, is a valuable yet underutilized technique that can
enhance accessibility for people with low vision. However, the lower bandwidth
of the auditory channel makes it difficult to fully convey dense
visualizations. For this reason, interactivity is key in making full use of its
potential. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the sonification of
dense line charts. We utilize the metaphor of a string instrument, where
individual line segments can be "plucked". We propose an importance-driven
approach which encodes the directionality of line segments using frequency and
dynamically scales amplitude for improved density perception. We discuss the
potential of our approach based on a set of examples.

<p class="mathjax">We presents a self-stabilizing algorithm for the unison problem which
achieves an efficient trade-off between time, workload and space in a weak
model. Our algorithm is defined in the atomic-state model and works in a
simplified version of the \emph{stone age} model in which networks are
anonymous and local ports are unlabelled. It makes no assumption on the daemon
and thus stabilizes under the weakest one: the distributed unfair daemon.
Assuming a period $B \geq 2D+2$, our algorithm stabilizes in at most $2D-2$
rounds and $O(\min(n^2B, n^3))$ moves, while using $\lceil\log B\rceil +2$ bits
per node where $D$ is the network diameter and $n$ the number of nodes. In
particular and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first self-stabilizing
unison for arbitrary anonymous networks achieving an asymptotically optimal
stabilization time in rounds using a bounded memory at each node. Finally, we
show that our solution allows to efficiently simulate synchronous
self-stabilizing algorithms in an asynchronous environment. This provides new
state-of-the-art algorithm solving both the leader election and the spanning
tree construction problem in any identified connected network which, to the
best of our knowledge, beat all known solutions in the literature.

<p class="mathjax">We discuss the problem of finding non-trivial invariants of
non-deterministic, symmetric cut-reduction procedures in the classical sequent
calculus. We come to the conclusion that (an enriched version of) the
propositional fragment of GS4 -- i.e. the one-sided variant of Kleene's
context-sharing style sequent system G4, where independent rule applications
permute freely -- is an ideal framework in which to attack the problem. We show
that the graph induced by axiom rules linking dual atom occurrences is
preserved under arbitrary rule permutations in the cut-free fragment of GS4. We
then refine the notion of axiom-induced graph so as to extend the result to
derivations with cuts, and we exploit the invertibility of logical rules to
define a global normalisation procedure that preserves the refined
axiom-induced graphs, thus yielding a non-trivial invariant of cut-elimination
in GS4. Finally, we build upon the result to devise a new proof system for
classical propositional logic, where the rule permutations of GS4 reduce to
identities.

<p class="mathjax">Errors dynamics captures the evolution of the state errors between two
distinct trajectories, that are governed by the same system rule but initiated
or perturbed differently. In particular, state observer error dynamics analysis
in matrix Lie group is fundamental in practice. In this paper, we focus on the
error dynamics analysis for an affine group system under external disturbances
or random noises. To this end, we first discuss the connections between the
notions of affine group systems and linear group systems. We provide two
equivalent characterizations of a linear group system. Such characterizations
are based on the homeomorphism of its transition flow and linearity of its Lie
algebra counterpart, respectively. Next, we investigate the evolution of a
linear group system and we assume it is diffused by a Brownian motion in
tangent spaces. We further show that the dynamics projected in the Lie algebra
is governed by a stochastic differential equation with a linear drift term. We
apply these findings in analyzing the error dynamics. Under differentiable
disturbance, we derive an ordinary differential equation characterizing the
evolution of the projected errors in the Lie algebra. In addition, the
counterpart with stochastic disturbances is derived for the projected errors in
terms of a stochastic differential equation. Explicit and accurate derivation
of error dynamics is provided for matrix group $SE_N(3)$, which plays a vital
role especially in robotic applications.

<p class="mathjax">Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is a novel task that aims to train
high-performance student models using only the teacher network without original
training data. Despite encouraging results, existing DFKD methods rely heavily
on generation modules with high computational costs. Meanwhile, they ignore the
fact that the generated and original data exist domain shifts due to the lack
of supervision information. Moreover, knowledge is transferred through each
example, ignoring the implicit relationship among multiple examples. To this
end, we propose a novel Open-world Data Sampling Distillation (ODSD) method
without a redundant generation process. First, we try to sample open-world data
close to the original data's distribution by an adaptive sampling module. Then,
we introduce a low-noise representation to alleviate the domain shifts and
build a structured relationship of multiple data examples to exploit data
knowledge. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, NYUv2, and ImageNet
show that our ODSD method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Especially, we
improve 1.50\%-9.59\% accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared with the
existing results.

<p class="mathjax">Digital signal theory is an extension of the analysis of continuous signals.
This extension is provided by discretization and sampling. The sampling of
signals can be mathematically described by a series of Dirac impulses and is
well known. Properties of the Dirac impulse, such as sampling, are derived in
distribution theory. The theory generalizes differential calculus to functions
that are not differentiable in the classical sense such as the Heaviside step
function. Therefore, distribution theory allows one to adopt analog analysis
concepts to digital signals. In this report, we extend the concept of Dirac
combs, a series of Dirac impulses as known from signal theory, to performance
analysis of computers. The goal is to connect methods from electrical
engineering or physics to different models of computation such as graphs, and
network as well as real-time calculus.

<p class="mathjax">Conditional 3D generation is undergoing a significant advancement, enabling
the free creation of 3D content from inputs such as text or 2D images. However,
previous approaches have suffered from low inference efficiency, limited
generation categories, and restricted downstream applications. In this work, we
revisit the impact of different 3D representations on generation quality and
efficiency. We propose a progressive generation method through Voxel-Point
Progressive Representation (VPP). VPP leverages structured voxel representation
in the proposed Voxel Semantic Generator and the sparsity of unstructured point
representation in the Point Upsampler, enabling efficient generation of
multi-category objects. VPP can generate high-quality 8K point clouds within
0.2 seconds. Additionally, the masked generation Transformer allows for various
3D downstream tasks, such as generation, editing, completion, and pre-training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VPP efficiently generates high-fidelity
and diverse 3D shapes across different categories, while also exhibiting
excellent representation transfer performance. Codes will be released on
https://github.com/qizekun/VPP.

In this work, we define a new Identity Certification Token (ICT) for OIDC. An
ICT can be thought of as a JSON-based, short-lived user certificate for
end-to-end user authentication without the need for cumbersome key management.
A user can request an ICT from his OpenID Provider (OP) and use it to prove his
identity to other users or services that trust the OP. We call this approach
$OIDC^2$ and compare it to other well-known end-to-end authentication methods.
Unlike certificates, $OIDC^2$ does not require installation and can be easily
used on multiple devices, making it more user-friendly. We outline protocols
for implementing $OIDC^2$ based on existing standards. We discuss the trust
relationship between entities involved in $OIDC^2$, propose a classification of
OPs' trust level, and propose authentication with multiple ICTs from different
OPs. We explain how different applications such as videoconferencing, instant
messaging, and email can benefit from ICTs for end-to-end authentication and
recommend validity periods for ICTs. To test $OIDC^2$, we provide a simple
extension to existing OIDC server software and evaluate its performance.

<p class="mathjax">Online social media is rife with offensive and hateful comments, prompting
the need for their automatic detection given the sheer amount of posts created
every second. Creating high-quality human-labelled datasets for this task is
difficult and costly, especially because non-offensive posts are significantly
more frequent than offensive ones. However, unlabelled data is abundant,
easier, and cheaper to obtain. In this scenario, self-training methods, using
weakly-labelled examples to increase the amount of training data, can be
employed. Recent "noisy" self-training approaches incorporate data augmentation
techniques to ensure prediction consistency and increase robustness against
noisy data and adversarial attacks. In this paper, we experiment with default
and noisy self-training using three different textual data augmentation
techniques across five different pre-trained BERT architectures varying in
size. We evaluate our experiments on two offensive/hate-speech datasets and
demonstrate that (i) self-training consistently improves performance regardless
of model size, resulting in up to +1.5% F1-macro on both datasets, and (ii)
noisy self-training with textual data augmentations, despite being successfully
applied in similar settings, decreases performance on offensive and hate-speech
domains when compared to the default method, even with state-of-the-art
augmentations such as backtranslation.

<p class="mathjax">A \emph{$\nu$-reliable spanner} of a metric space $(X,d)$, is a (dominating)
graph $H$, such that for any possible failure set $B\subseteq X$, there is a
set $B^+$ just slightly larger $|B^+|\le(1+\nu)\cdot|B|$, and all distances
between pairs in $X\setminus B^+$ are (approximately) preserved in $H\setminus
B$. Recently, there have been several works on sparse reliable spanners in
various settings, but so far, the weight of such spanners has not been analyzed
at all. In this work, we initiate the study of \emph{light} reliable spanners,
whose weight is proportional to that of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of $X$.
<br />We first observe that unlike sparsity, the lightness of any deterministic
reliable spanner is huge, even for the metric of the simple path graph.
Therefore, randomness must be used: an \emph{oblivious} reliable spanner is a
distribution over spanners, and the bound on $|B^+|$ holds in expectation.
<br />We devise an oblivious $\nu$-reliable $(2+\frac{2}{k-1})$-spanner for any
$k$-HST, whose lightness is $\approx \nu^{-2}$. We demonstrate a matching
$\Omega(\nu^{-2})$ lower bound on the lightness (for any finite stretch). We
also note that any stretch below 2 must incur linear lightness.
<br />For general metrics, doubling metrics, and metrics arising from minor-free
graphs, we construct {\em light} tree covers, in which every tree is a $k$-HST
of low weight. Combining these covers with our results for $k$-HSTs, we obtain
oblivious reliable light spanners for these metric spaces, with nearly optimal
parameters. In particular, for doubling metrics we get an oblivious
$\nu$-reliable $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner with lightness $\varepsilon^{-O({\rm
ddim})}\cdot\tilde{O}(\nu^{-2}\cdot\log n)$, which is best possible (up to
lower order terms).

<p class="mathjax">In real-world applications, perfect labels are rarely available, making it
challenging to develop robust machine learning algorithms that can handle noisy
labels. Recent methods have focused on filtering noise based on the discrepancy
between model predictions and given noisy labels, assuming that samples with
small classification losses are clean. This work takes a different approach by
leveraging the consistency between the learned model and the entire noisy
dataset using the rich representational and topological information in the
data. We introduce LaplaceConfidence, a method that to obtain label confidence
(i.e., clean probabilities) utilizing the Laplacian energy. Specifically, it
first constructs graphs based on the feature representations of all noisy
samples and minimizes the Laplacian energy to produce a low-energy graph. Clean
labels should fit well into the low-energy graph while noisy ones should not,
allowing our method to determine data's clean probabilities. Furthermore,
LaplaceConfidence is embedded into a holistic method for robust training, where
co-training technique generates unbiased label confidence and label
refurbishment technique better utilizes it. We also explore the dimensionality
reduction technique to accommodate our method on large-scale noisy datasets.
Our experiments demonstrate that LaplaceConfidence outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on benchmark datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning are becoming trendy in 3D
autonomous driving scenario, considering robust prediction and computation
budget. However, naively extending the existing framework to the domain of
multi-modality multi-task learning remains ineffective and even poisonous due
to the notorious modality bias and task conflict. Previous works manually
coordinate the learning framework with empirical knowledge, which may lead to
sub-optima. To mitigate the issue, we propose a novel yet simple multi-level
gradient calibration learning framework across tasks and modalities during
optimization. Specifically, the gradients, produced by the task heads and used
to update the shared backbone, will be calibrated at the backbone's last layer
to alleviate the task conflict. Before the calibrated gradients are further
propagated to the modality branches of the backbone, their magnitudes will be
calibrated again to the same level, ensuring the downstream tasks pay balanced
attention to different modalities. Experiments on large-scale benchmark
nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, eg, an absolute
14.4% mIoU improvement on map segmentation and 1.4% mAP improvement on 3D
detection, advancing the application of 3D autonomous driving in the domain of
multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning. We also discuss the links
between modalities and tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task aims to segment sounding objects
from a given video. Existing works mainly focus on fusing audio and visual
features of a given video to achieve sounding object masks. However, we
observed that prior arts are prone to segment a certain salient object in a
video regardless of the audio information. This is because sounding objects are
often the most salient ones in the AVS dataset. Thus, current AVS methods might
fail to localize genuine sounding objects due to the dataset bias. In this
work, we present an audio-visual instance-aware segmentation approach to
overcome the dataset bias. In a nutshell, our method first localizes potential
sounding objects in a video by an object segmentation network, and then
associates the sounding object candidates with the given audio. We notice that
an object could be a sounding object in one video but a silent one in another
video. This would bring ambiguity in training our object segmentation network
as only sounding objects have corresponding segmentation masks. We thus propose
a silent object-aware segmentation objective to alleviate the ambiguity.
Moreover, since the category information of audio is unknown, especially for
multiple sounding sources, we propose to explore the audio-visual semantic
correlation and then associate audio with potential objects. Specifically, we
attend predicted audio category scores to potential instance masks and these
scores will highlight corresponding sounding instances while suppressing
inaudible ones. When we enforce the attended instance masks to resemble the
ground-truth mask, we are able to establish audio-visual semantics correlation.
Experimental results on the AVS benchmarks demonstrate that our method can
effectively segment sounding objects without being biased to salient objects.

<p class="mathjax">In Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO), an agent intervenes on an unknown
structural causal model to maximize a downstream reward variable. In this
paper, we consider the generalization where other agents or external events
also intervene on the system, which is key for enabling adaptiveness to
non-stationarities such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We
formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian
Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded
regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). Our
approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of
the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward
estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. We derive regret
bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further
propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions
and submodular rewards. Empirically, CBO-MW outperforms non-causal and
non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and
environments based on real-word data. Our experiments include a realistic
demonstration of how CBO-MW can be used to learn users' demand patterns in a
shared mobility system and reposition vehicles in strategic areas.

<p class="mathjax">The language models, especially the basic text classification models, have
been shown to be susceptible to textual adversarial attacks such as synonym
substitution and word insertion attacks. To defend against such attacks, a
growing body of research has been devoted to improving the model robustness.
However, providing provable robustness guarantees instead of empirical
robustness is still widely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Text-CRS, a
generalized certified robustness framework for natural language processing
(NLP) based on randomized smoothing. To our best knowledge, existing certified
schemes for NLP can only certify the robustness against $\ell_0$ perturbations
in synonym substitution attacks. Representing each word-level adversarial
operation (i.e., synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and
deletion) as a combination of permutation and embedding transformation, we
propose novel smoothing theorems to derive robustness bounds in both
permutation and embedding space against such adversarial operations. To further
improve certified accuracy and radius, we consider the numerical relationships
between discrete words and select proper noise distributions for the randomized
smoothing. Finally, we conduct substantial experiments on multiple language
models and datasets. Text-CRS can address all four different word-level
adversarial operations and achieve a significant accuracy improvement. We also
provide the first benchmark on certified accuracy and radius of four word-level
operations, besides outperforming the state-of-the-art certification against
synonym substitution attacks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a CLIP-based unsupervised learning method for
annotation-free multi-label image classification, including three stages:
initialization, training, and inference. At the initialization stage, we take
full advantage of the powerful CLIP model and propose a novel approach to
extend CLIP for multi-label predictions based on global-local image-text
similarity aggregation. To be more specific, we split each image into snippets
and leverage CLIP to generate the similarity vector for the whole image
(global) as well as each snippet (local). Then a similarity aggregator is
introduced to leverage the global and local similarity vectors. Using the
aggregated similarity scores as the initial pseudo labels at the training
stage, we propose an optimization framework to train the parameters of the
classification network and refine pseudo labels for unobserved labels. During
inference, only the classification network is used to predict the labels of the
input image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC
2012, and NUS datasets and even achieves comparable results to weakly
supervised classification methods.

<p class="mathjax">The paper focuses on deep learning semantic search algorithms applied in the
HR domain. The aim of the article is developing a novel approach to training a
Siamese network to link the skills mentioned in the job ad with the title. It
has been shown that the title normalization process can be based either on
classification or similarity comparison approaches. While classification
algorithms strive to classify a sample into predefined set of categories,
similarity search algorithms take a more flexible approach, since they are
designed to find samples that are similar to a given query sample, without
requiring pre-defined classes and labels. In this article semantic similarity
search to find candidates for title normalization has been used. A pre-trained
language model has been adapted while teaching it to match titles and skills
based on co-occurrence information. For the purpose of this research fifty
billion title-descriptions pairs had been collected for training the model and
thirty three thousand title-description-normalized title triplets, where
normalized job title was picked up manually by job ad creator for testing
purposes. As baselines FastText, BERT, SentenceBert and JobBert have been used.
As a metric of the accuracy of the designed algorithm is Recall in top one,
five and ten model's suggestions. It has been shown that the novel training
objective lets it achieve significant improvement in comparison to other
generic and specific text encoders. Two settings with treating titles as
standalone strings, and with included skills as additional features during
inference have been used and the results have been compared in this article.
Improvements by 10% and 21.5% have been achieved using VacancySBERT and
VacancySBERT (with skills) respectively. The benchmark has been developed as
open-source to foster further research in the area.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate the properties of standard and multilevel Monte
Carlo methods for weak approximation of solutions of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) driven by the infinite-dimensional Wiener process and Poisson
random measure with the Lipschitz payoff function. The error of the truncated
dimension randomized numerical scheme, which is determined by two parameters,
i.e grid density $n \in \mathbb{N}_{+}$ and truncation dimension parameter $M
\in \mathbb{N}_{+},$ is of the order $n^{-1/2}+\delta(M)$ such that
$\delta(\cdot)$ is positive and decreasing to $0$. The paper introduces the
complexity model and provides proof for the upper complexity bound of the
multilevel Monte Carlo method which depends on two increasing sequences of
parameters for both $n$ and $M.$ The complexity is measured in terms of upper
bound for mean-squared error and compared with the complexity of the standard
Monte Carlo algorithm. The results from numerical experiments as well as Python

<p class="mathjax">Living needs refer to the various needs in human's daily lives for survival
and well-being, including food, housing, entertainment, etc. On life service
platforms that connect users to service providers, such as Meituan, the problem
of living needs prediction is fundamental as it helps understand users and
boost various downstream applications such as personalized recommendation.
However, the problem has not been well explored and is faced with two critical
challenges. First, the needs are naturally connected to specific locations and
times, suffering from complex impacts from the spatiotemporal context. Second,
there is a significant gap between users' actual living needs and their
historical records on the platform. To address these two challenges, we design
a system of living NEeds predictiON named NEON, consisting of three phases:
feature mining, feature fusion, and multi-task prediction. In the feature
mining phase, we carefully extract individual-level user features for
spatiotemporal modeling, and aggregated-level behavioral features for enriching
data, which serve as the basis for addressing two challenges, respectively.
Further, in the feature fusion phase, we propose a neural network that
effectively fuses two parts of features into the user representation. Moreover,
we design a multi-task prediction phase, where the auxiliary task of
needs-meeting way prediction can enhance the modeling of spatiotemporal
context. Extensive offline evaluations verify that our NEON system can
effectively predict users' living needs. Furthermore, we deploy NEON into
Meituan's algorithm engine and evaluate how it enhances the three downstream
prediction applications, via large-scale online A/B testing.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant interest.
With in-context learning, LLMs achieve impressive results in various natural
language tasks. However, the application of LLMs to sentence embeddings remains
an area of ongoing research. In this work, we propose an in-context
learning-based method aimed at improving sentence embeddings performance. Our
approach involves adapting the previous prompt-based representation method for
autoregressive models, constructing a demonstration set that enables LLMs to
perform in-context learning, and scaling up the LLMs to different model sizes.
Through extensive experiments, in-context learning enables LLMs to generate
high-quality sentence embeddings without any fine-tuning. It helps LLMs achieve
performance comparable to current contrastive learning methods. By scaling
model size, we find scaling to more than tens of billion parameters harms the
performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, the largest
model outperforms other counterparts and achieves the new state-of-the-art
result on transfer tasks. We also fine-tune LLMs with current contrastive
learning approach, and the 2.7B OPT model, incorporating our prompt-based
method, surpasses the performance of 4.8B ST5, achieving the new
state-of-the-art results on STS tasks. Our code is available at

for Ontology Learning (OL). LLMs have shown significant advancements in natural
language processing, demonstrating their ability to capture complex language

following hypothesis: \textit{Can LLMs effectively apply their language pattern
capturing capability to OL, which involves automatically extracting and
structuring knowledge from natural language text?} To test this hypothesis, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation using the zero-shot prompting method. We
evaluate nine different LLM model families for three main OL tasks: term
typing, taxonomy discovery, and extraction of non-taxonomic relations.
Additionally, the evaluations encompass diverse genres of ontological
knowledge, including lexicosemantic knowledge in WordNet, geographical

<p class="mathjax">ChatGPT, an implementation and application of large language models, has
gained significant popularity since its initial release. Researchers have been
exploring ways to harness the practical benefits of ChatGPT in real-world
scenarios. Educational researchers have investigated its potential in various
subjects, e.g., programming, mathematics, finance, clinical decision support,
etc. However, there has been limited attention given to its application in data
science education. This paper aims to bridge that gap by utilizing ChatGPT in a
data science course, gathering perspectives from students, and presenting our
experiences and feedback on using ChatGPT for teaching and learning in data
science education. The findings not only distinguish data science education
from other disciplines but also uncover new opportunities and challenges

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models have shown great promise in various healthcare
monitoring applications. However, most healthcare datasets with high-quality
(gold-standard) labels are small-scale, as directly collecting ground truth is
often costly and time-consuming. As a result, models developed and validated on
small-scale datasets often suffer from overfitting and do not generalize well
to unseen scenarios. At the same time, large amounts of imprecise
(silver-standard) labeled data, annotated by approximate methods with the help
of modern wearables and in the absence of ground truth validation, are starting
to emerge. However, due to measurement differences, this data displays
significant label distribution shifts, which motivates the use of domain
adaptation. To this end, we introduce UDAMA, a method with two key components:
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Multidiscriminator Adversarial Training,
where we pre-train on the silver-standard data and employ adversarial
adaptation with the gold-standard data along with two domain discriminators. In
particular, we showcase the practical potential of UDAMA by applying it to
Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) prediction. CRF is a crucial determinant of
metabolic disease and mortality, and it presents labels with various levels of
noise (goldand silver-standard), making it challenging to establish an accurate
prediction model. Our results show promising performance by alleviating
distribution shifts in various label shift settings. Additionally, by using
data from two free-living cohort studies (Fenland and BBVS), we show that UDAMA
consistently outperforms up to 12% compared to competitive transfer learning
and state-of-the-art domain adaptation models, paving the way for leveraging
noisy labeled data to improve fitness estimation at scale.

<p class="mathjax">Models capable of leveraging unlabelled data are crucial in overcoming large
distribution gaps between the acquired datasets across different imaging
devices and configurations. In this regard, self-training techniques based on
pseudo-labeling have been shown to be highly effective for semi-supervised
domain adaptation. However, the unreliability of pseudo labels can hinder the
capability of self-training techniques to induce abstract representation from
the unlabeled target dataset, especially in the case of large distribution
gaps. Since the neural network performance should be invariant to image
transformations, we look to this fact to identify uncertain pseudo labels.
Indeed, we argue that transformation invariant detections can provide more
reasonable approximations of ground truth. Accordingly, we propose a
semi-supervised learning strategy for domain adaptation termed
transformation-invariant self-training (TI-ST). The proposed method assesses
pixel-wise pseudo-labels' reliability and filters out unreliable detections
during self-training. We perform comprehensive evaluations for domain
adaptation using three different modalities of medical images, two different
network architectures, and several alternative state-of-the-art domain
adaptation methods. Experimental results confirm the superiority of our
proposed method in mitigating the lack of target domain annotation and boosting
segmentation performance in the target domain.

<p class="mathjax">Disaster response is critical to save lives and reduce damages in the
aftermath of a disaster. Fundamental to disaster response operations is the
management of disaster relief resources. To this end, a local agency (e.g., a
local emergency resource distribution center) collects demands from local
communities affected by a disaster, dispatches available resources to meet the
demands, and requests more resources from a central emergency management agency
(e.g., Federal Emergency Management Agency in the U.S.). Prior resource
management research for disaster response overlooks the problem of deciding
optimal quantities of resources requested by a local agency. In response to
this research gap, we define a new resource management problem that proactively
decides optimal quantities of requested resources by considering both currently
unfulfilled demands and future demands. To solve the problem, we take salient
characteristics of the problem into consideration and develop a novel deep
learning method for future demand prediction. We then formulate the problem as
a stochastic optimization model, analyze key properties of the model, and
propose an effective solution method to the problem based on the analyzed
properties. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method over
prevalent existing methods using both real world and simulated data. We also
show its superiority over prevalent existing methods in a multi-stakeholder and
multi-objective setting through simulations.

to produce a graph structure in these problems is usually treated as a matter

work, we elevate this question to utmost importance as the Topology Problem. We
propose an attention mechanism that allows a graph to be constructed in a
learned space that handles geometrically the flow of relevance, providing one
solution to the Topology Problem. We test this architecture, called
GravNetNorm, on the task of top jet tagging, and show that it is competitive in

<p class="mathjax">Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the hardest tasks in natural
language understanding and knowledge engineering. The glass ceiling of 80% F1
score is recently achieved through supervised deep-learning, enriched by a
variety of knowledge graphs. Here, we propose a novel neurosymbolic methodology
that is able to push the F1 score above 90%. The core of our methodology is a
neurosymbolic sense embedding, in terms of a configuration of nested balls in
n-dimensional space. The centre point of a ball well-preserves word embedding,
which partially fix the locations of balls. Inclusion relations among balls
precisely encode symbolic hypernym relations among senses, and enable simple
logic deduction among sense embeddings, which cannot be realised before. We
trained a Transformer to learn the mapping from a contextualized word embedding
to its sense ball embedding, just like playing the game of darts (a game of
shooting darts into a dartboard). A series of experiments are conducted by
utilizing pre-training n-ball embeddings, which have the coverage of around 70%
training data and 75% testing data in the benchmark WSD corpus. The F1 scores
in experiments range from 90.1% to 100.0% in all six groups of test data-sets
(each group has 4 testing data with different sizes of n-ball embeddings). Our
novel neurosymbolic methodology has the potential to break the ceiling of
deep-learning approaches for WSD. Limitations and extensions of our current

<p class="mathjax">Computed Tomography (CT) is a prominent example of Imaging Inverse Problem
(IIP), highlighting the unrivalled performances of data-driven methods in
degraded measurements setups like sparse X-ray projections. Although a
significant proportion of deep learning approaches benefit from large
supervised datasets to directly map experimental measurements to medical scans,
they cannot generalize to unknown acquisition setups. In contrast, fully
unsupervised techniques, most notably using score-based generative models, have
recently demonstrated similar or better performances compared to supervised
approaches to solve IIPs while being flexible at test time regarding the
imaging setup. However, their use cases are limited by two factors: (a) they
need considerable amounts of training data to have good generalization
properties and (b) they require a backward operator, like
Filtered-Back-Projection in the case of CT, to condition the learned prior
distribution of medical scans to experimental measurements. To overcome these
issues, we propose an unsupervised conditional approach to the Generative
Latent Optimization framework (cGLO), in which the parameters of a decoder
network are initialized on an unsupervised dataset. The decoder is then used
for reconstruction purposes, by performing Generative Latent Optimization with
a loss function directly comparing simulated measurements from proposed
reconstructions to experimental measurements. The resulting approach, tested on
sparse-view CT using multiple training dataset sizes, demonstrates better
reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art score-based strategies in
most data regimes and shows an increasing performance advantage for smaller
training datasets and reduced projection angles. Furthermore, cGLO does not
require any backward operator and could expand use cases even to non-linear
IIPs.

<p class="mathjax">3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) empowers mobile robots to accomplish
well-informed motion planning and navigation tasks by providing motion
trajectories of surrounding objects. However, existing 3D MOT methods typically
employ a single similarity metric and physical model to perform data
association and state estimation for all objects. With large-scale modern
datasets and real scenes, there are a variety of object categories that
commonly exhibit distinctive geometric properties and motion patterns. In this
way, such distinctions would enable various object categories to behave
differently under the same standard, resulting in erroneous matches between
trajectories and detections, and jeopardizing the reliability of downstream
tasks (navigation, etc.). Towards this end, we propose Poly-MOT, an efficient
3D MOT method based on the Tracking-By-Detection framework that enables the
tracker to choose the most appropriate tracking criteria for each object
category. Specifically, Poly-MOT leverages different motion models for various
object categories to characterize distinct types of motion accurately. We also
introduce the constraint of the rigid structure of objects into a specific
motion model to accurately describe the highly nonlinear motion of the object.
Additionally, we introduce a two-stage data association strategy to ensure that
objects can find the optimal similarity metric from three custom metrics for
their categories and reduce missing matches. On the NuScenes dataset, our
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 75.4\% AMOTA. The

<p class="mathjax">Legged locomotion is arguably the most suited and versatile mode to deal with
natural or unstructured terrains. Intensive research into dynamic walking and
running controllers has recently yielded great advances, both in the optimal
control and reinforcement learning (RL) literature. Hopping is a challenging
dynamic task involving a flight phase and has the potential to increase the
traversability of legged robots. Model based control for hopping typically
relies on accurate detection of different jump phases, such as lift-off or
touch down, and using different controllers for each phase. In this paper, we
present a end-to-end RL based torque controller that learns to implicitly
detect the relevant jump phases, removing the need to provide manual heuristics
for state detection. We also extend a method for simulation to reality transfer
of the learned controller to contact rich dynamic tasks, resulting in
successful deployment on the robot after training without parameter tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models and large language models have emerged as leading-edge
generative models and have sparked a revolutionary impact on various aspects of
human life. However, the practical implementation of these models has also
exposed inherent risks, highlighting their dual nature and raising concerns
regarding their trustworthiness. Despite the abundance of literature on this
subject, a comprehensive survey specifically delving into the intersection of
large-scale generative models and their trustworthiness remains largely absent.
To bridge this gap, This paper investigates both the long-standing and emerging
threats associated with these models across four fundamental dimensions:
privacy, security, fairness, and responsibility. In this way, we construct an
extensive map outlining the trustworthiness of these models, while also
providing practical recommendations and identifying future directions. These
efforts are crucial for promoting the trustworthy deployment of these models,
ultimately benefiting society as a whole.

<p class="mathjax">A sizable part of the fleet of heavy-duty machinery in the construction
equipment industry uses the conventional valve-controlled load-sensing
hydraulics. Rigorous climate actions towards reducing CO$_{2}$ emissions has
sparked the development of solutions to lower the energy consumption and
increase the productivity of the machines. One promising solution to having a
better balance between energy and performance is to build accurate models
(digital twins) of the real systems using data together with recent advances in
machine learning/model-based optimization to improve the control systems. With
a particular focus on real-world machines with multiple flow-controlled
actuators and shared variable-displacement pumps, this paper presents a
generalized machine learning approach to modeling the working pressure of the
actuators and the overall pump pressures. The procedures for deriving reaction
forces and flow rates as important input variables to the surrogate models are
described in detail. Using data from a real loader crane testbed, we
demonstrate training and validation of individual models, and showcase the
accuracy of pressure predictions in five different experiments under various
utilizations and pressure levels.

<p class="mathjax">Responsibility anticipation is the process of determining if the actions of
an individual agent may cause it to be responsible for a particular outcome.
This can be used in a multi-agent planning setting to allow agents to
anticipate responsibility in the plans they consider. The planning setting in
this paper includes partial information regarding the initial state and
considers formulas in linear temporal logic as positive or negative outcomes to
be attained or avoided. We firstly define attribution for notions of active,
passive and contributive responsibility, and consider their agentive variants.
We then use these to define the notion of responsibility anticipation. We prove
that our notions of anticipated responsibility can be used to coordinate agents
in a planning setting and give complexity results for our model, discussing
equivalence with classical planning. We also present an outline for solving
some of our attribution and anticipation problems using PDDL solvers.

<p class="mathjax">Image captioning is conventionally formulated as the task of generating
captions for images that match the distribution of reference image-caption
pairs. However, reference captions in standard captioning datasets are short
and may not uniquely identify the images they describe. These problems are
further exacerbated when models are trained directly on image-alt text pairs
collected from the internet. In this work, we show that it is possible to
generate more specific captions with minimal changes to the training process.
We implement classifier-free guidance for an autoregressive captioning model by
fine-tuning it to estimate both conditional and unconditional distributions
over captions. The guidance scale applied at decoding controls a trade-off
between maximizing $p(\mathrm{caption}|\mathrm{image})$ and
$p(\mathrm{image}|\mathrm{caption})$. Compared to standard greedy decoding,
decoding with a guidance scale of 2 substantially improves reference-free
metrics such as CLIPScore (0.808 vs. 0.775) and caption$\to$image retrieval
performance in the CLIP embedding space (recall@1 44.6% vs. 26.5%), but worsens
standard reference-based captioning metrics (e.g., CIDEr 78.6 vs 126.1). We
further explore the use of language models to guide the decoding process,
obtaining small improvements over the Pareto frontier of reference-free vs.
reference-based captioning metrics that arises from classifier-free guidance,
and substantially improving the quality of captions generated from a model
trained only on minimally curated web data.

<p class="mathjax">Denoising diffusion probabilistic models that were initially proposed for
realistic image generation have recently shown success in various perception
tasks (e.g., object detection and image segmentation) and are increasingly
gaining attention in computer vision. However, extending such models to
multi-frame human pose estimation is non-trivial due to the presence of the
additional temporal dimension in videos. More importantly, learning
representations that focus on keypoint regions is crucial for accurate
localization of human joints. Nevertheless, the adaptation of the
diffusion-based methods remains unclear on how to achieve such objective. In
this paper, we present DiffPose, a novel diffusion architecture that formulates
video-based human pose estimation as a conditional heatmap generation problem.
First, to better leverage temporal information, we propose SpatioTemporal
Representation Learner which aggregates visual evidences across frames and uses
the resulting features in each denoising step as a condition. In addition, we
present a mechanism called Lookup-based MultiScale Feature Interaction that
determines the correlations between local joints and global contexts across
multiple scales. This mechanism generates delicate representations that focus
on keypoint regions. Altogether, by extending diffusion models, we show two
unique characteristics from DiffPose on pose estimation task: (i) the ability
to combine multiple sets of pose estimates to improve prediction accuracy,
particularly for challenging joints, and (ii) the ability to adjust the number
of iterative steps for feature refinement without retraining the model.
DiffPose sets new state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks: PoseTrack2017,
PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to handle miscommunication is crucial to robust and faithful
conversational AI. People usually deal with miscommunication immediately as
they detect it, using highly systematic interactional mechanisms called repair.
One important type of repair is Third Position Repair (TPR) whereby a speaker
is initially misunderstood but then corrects the misunderstanding as it becomes
apparent after the addressee's erroneous response. Here, we collect and
publicly release Repair-QA, the first large dataset of TPRs in a conversational
question answering (QA) setting. The data is comprised of the TPR turns,
corresponding dialogue contexts, and candidate repairs of the original turn for
execution of TPRs. We demonstrate the usefulness of the data by training and
evaluating strong baseline models for executing TPRs. For stand-alone TPR
execution, we perform both automatic and human evaluations on a fine-tuned T5
model, as well as OpenAI's GPT-3 LLMs. Additionally, we extrinsically evaluate
the LLMs' TPR processing capabilities in the downstream conversational QA task.
The results indicate poor out-of-the-box performance on TPR's by the GPT-3
models, which then significantly improves when exposed to Repair-QA.

<p class="mathjax">The log-structured merge tree (LSM-tree) is widely employed to build
key-value (KV) stores. LSM-tree organizes multiple levels in memory and on
disk. The compaction of LSM-tree, which is used to redeploy KV pairs between
on-disk levels in the form of SST files, severely stalls its foreground
service. We overhaul and analyze the procedure of compaction. Writing and
persisting files with fsyncs for compacted KV pairs are time-consuming and,
more important, occur synchronously on the critical path of compaction. The
user-space compaction thread of LSM-tree stays waiting for completion signals
from a kernel-space thread that is processing file write and fsync I/Os.
<br />We accordingly design a new LSM-tree variant named AisLSM with an
asynchronous I/O model. In short, AisLSM conducts asynchronous writes and
fsyncs for SST files generated in a compaction and overlaps CPU computations
with disk I/Os for consecutive compactions. AisLSM tracks the generation
dependency between input and output files for each compaction and utilizes a
deferred check-up strategy to ensure the durability of compacted KV pairs. We
prototype AisLSM with RocksDB and io_uring. Experiments show that AisLSM boosts
the performance of RocksDB by up to 2.14x, without losing data accessibility
and consistency. It also outperforms state-of-the-art LSM-tree variants with
significantly higher throughput and lower tail latency.

<p class="mathjax">Data uncertainties, such as sensor noise or occlusions, can introduce
irreducible ambiguities in images, which result in varying, yet plausible,
semantic hypotheses. In Machine Learning, this ambiguity is commonly referred
to as aleatoric uncertainty. Latent density models can be utilized to address
this problem in image segmentation. The most popular approach is the
Probabilistic U-Net (PU-Net), which uses latent Normal densities to optimize
the conditional data log-likelihood Evidence Lower Bound. In this work, we
demonstrate that the PU- Net latent space is severely inhomogenous. As a
result, the effectiveness of gradient descent is inhibited and the model
becomes extremely sensitive to the localization of the latent space samples,
resulting in defective predictions. To address this, we present the Sinkhorn
PU-Net (SPU-Net), which uses the Sinkhorn Divergence to promote homogeneity
across all latent dimensions, effectively improving gradient-descent updates
and model robustness. Our results show that by applying this on public datasets
of various clinical segmentation problems, the SPU-Net receives up to 11%
performance gains compared against preceding latent variable models for
probabilistic segmentation on the Hungarian-Matched metric. The results
indicate that by encouraging a homogeneous latent space, one can significantly
improve latent density modeling for medical image segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">As a way of addressing increasingly sophisticated problems, software
professionals face the constant challenge of seeking improvement. However, for
these individuals to enhance their skills, their process of studying and

context of software companies, where the scale of professionals undergoing

challenging. To circumvent this challenge, this work presents an exploration of
using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support the correction process of

<br />In this study, we utilized ChatGPT to correct open-ended questions answered

natural language sentences into Description Logic. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) are the best tools for translations, we fine-tuned a GPT-3 model to
convert Natural Language sentences into OWL Functional Syntax. We employ
objective and concise examples to fine-tune the model regarding: instances,
class subsumption, domain and range of relations, object properties
relationships, disjoint classes, complements, cardinality restrictions. The
resulted axioms are used to enrich an ontology, in a human supervised manner.
The developed tool is publicly provided as a Protge plugin.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce and investigate forgetting 1-limited automata, which are
single-tape Turing machines that, when visit a cell for the first time, replace
the input symbol in it by a fixed symbol, so forgetting the original contents.
These devices have the same computational power as finite automata, namely they
characterize the class of regular languages. We study the cost in size of the
conversions of forgetting 1-limited automata, in both nondeterministic and
deterministic cases, into equivalent one-way nondeterministic and deterministic
automata, providing optimal bounds in terms of exponential or superpolynomial
functions. We also discuss the size relationships with two-way finite automata.
In this respect, we prove the existence of a language for which forgetting
1-limited automata are exponentially larger than equivalent minimal
deterministic two-way automata.

<p class="mathjax">Finding a solution to the linear system $Ax = b$ with various minimization
properties arises from many engineering and computer science applications,
including compressed sensing, image processing, and machine learning. In the
age of big data, the scalability of stochastic optimization algorithms has made
it increasingly important to solve problems of unprecedented sizes. This paper
focuses on the problem of minimizing a strongly convex objective function
subject to linearly constraints. We consider the dual formulation of this
problem and adopt the stochastic coordinate descent to solve it. The proposed
algorithmic framework, called fast stochastic dual coordinate descent, utilizes
an adaptive variation of Polyak's heavy ball momentum and user-defined
distributions for sampling. Our adaptive heavy ball momentum technique can
efficiently update the parameters by using iterative information, overcoming
the limitation of the heavy ball momentum method where prior knowledge of
certain parameters, such as singular values of a matrix, is required. We prove
that, under strongly admissible of the objective function, the propose method
converges linearly in expectation. By varying the sampling matrix, we recover a
comprehensive array of well-known algorithms as special cases, including the
randomized sparse Kaczmarz method, the randomized regularized Kaczmarz method,
the linearized Bregman iteration, and a variant of the conjugate gradient (CG)
method. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm our results.

<p class="mathjax">The Lookahead optimizer improves the training stability of deep neural
networks by having a set of fast weights that "look ahead" to guide the descent
direction. Here, we combine this idea with sharpness-aware minimization (SAM)
to stabilize its multi-step variant and improve the loss-sharpness trade-off.
We propose Lookbehind, which computes $k$ gradient ascent steps ("looking
behind") at each iteration and combine the gradients to bias the descent step
toward flatter minima. We apply Lookbehind on top of two popular
sharpness-aware training methods -- SAM and adaptive SAM (ASAM) -- and show

greater robustness against noisy weights, and higher tolerance to catastrophic

<p class="mathjax">Preserving the topology from being inferred by external adversaries has
become a paramount security issue for network systems (NSs), and adding random
noises to the nodal states provides a promising way. Nevertheless, recent works
have revealed that the topology cannot be preserved under i.i.d. noises in the
asymptotic sense. How to effectively characterize the non-asymptotic
preservation performance still remains an open issue. Inspired by the deviation
quantification of concentration inequalities, this paper proposes a novel
metric named trace-based variance-expectation ratio. This metric effectively
captures the decaying rate of the topology inference error, where a slower rate
indicates better non-asymptotic preservation performance. We prove that the
inference error will always decay to zero asymptotically, as long as the added
noises are non-increasing and independent (milder than the i.i.d. condition).
Then, the optimal noise design that produces the slowest decaying rate for the
error is obtained. More importantly, we amend the noise design by introducing
one-lag time dependence, achieving the zero state deviation and the non-zero
topology inference error in the asymptotic sense simultaneously. Extensions to
a general class of noises with multi-lag time dependence are provided.
Comprehensive simulations verify the theoretical findings.

(DP) to solve networked multi-agent Markov decision problems (MDPs). We
consider a distributed multi-agent case, where each agent does not have an
access to the rewards of other agents except for its own reward. Moreover, each
agent can share their parameters with its neighbors over a communication
network represented by a graph. We propose a distributed DP in the
continuous-time domain, and prove its convergence through control theoretic
viewpoints. The proposed analysis can be viewed as a preliminary ordinary

Our approach extends ergodic exploration methods, a recent exploration approach
that prioritizes complete coverage of a space, with the use of a learned image
classifier that automatically detects objects and updates an information map to
guide further exploration and localization of objects. Additionally, to improve
outcomes of the information collected by our robot's visual sensor, we present
a decomposition of the ergodic optimization problem as bi-level coarse and fine
solvers, which act respectively on the robot's body and the robot's visual
sensor.
<br />Our approach is applied to geological survey and localization of rock
formations for Mars rovers, with real images from Mars rovers used to train the
image classifier. Results demonstrate 1) improved localization of rock
formations compared to naive approaches while 2) minimizing the path length of
the exploration through the bi-level exploration.

<p class="mathjax">Phonetic information and linguistic knowledge are an essential component of a
Text-to-speech (TTS) front-end. Given a language, a lexicon can be collected
offline and Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) relationships are usually modeled in
order to predict the pronunciation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
Additionally, post-lexical phonology, often defined in the form of rule-based
systems, is used to correct pronunciation within or between words. In this work
we showcase a multilingual unified front-end system that addresses any
pronunciation related task, typically handled by separate modules. We evaluate
the proposed model on G2P conversion and other language-specific challenges,
such as homograph and polyphones disambiguation, post-lexical rules and
implicit diacritization. We find that the multilingual model is competitive
across languages and tasks, however, some trade-offs exists when compared to
equivalent monolingual solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Navigation of terrestrial robots is typically addressed either with
localization and mapping (SLAM) followed by classical planning on the
dynamically created maps, or by machine learning (ML), often through end-to-end
training with reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning (IL). Recently,
modular designs have achieved promising results, and hybrid algorithms that
combine ML with classical planning have been proposed. Existing methods
implement these combinations with hand-crafted functions, which cannot fully
exploit the complementary nature of the policies and the complex regularities
between scene structure and planning performance. Our work builds on the
hypothesis that the strengths and weaknesses of neural planners and classical
planners follow some regularities, which can be learned from training data, in
particular from interactions. This is grounded on the assumption that, both,
trained planners and the mapping algorithms underlying classical planning are
subject to failure cases depending on the semantics of the scene and that this
dependence is learnable: for instance, certain areas, objects or scene
structures can be reconstructed easier than others. We propose a hierarchical
method composed of a high-level planner dynamically switching between a
classical and a neural planner. We fully train all neural policies in
simulation and evaluate the method in both simulation and real experiments with
a LoCoBot robot, showing significant gains in performance, in particular in the
real environment. We also qualitatively conjecture on the nature of data
regularities exploited by the high-level planner.

<p class="mathjax">Encrypted traffic classification is receiving widespread attention from
researchers and industrial companies. However, the existing methods only
extract flow-level features, failing to handle short flows because of
unreliable statistical properties, or treat the header and payload equally,
failing to mine the potential correlation between bytes. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a byte-level traffic graph construction approach based on
point-wise mutual information (PMI), and a model named Temporal Fusion Encoder
using Graph Neural Networks (TFE-GNN) for feature extraction. In particular, we
design a dual embedding layer, a GNN-based traffic graph encoder as well as a
cross-gated feature fusion mechanism, which can first embed the header and
payload bytes separately and then fuses them together to obtain a stronger
feature representation. The experimental results on two real datasets
demonstrate that TFE-GNN outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods in
fine-grained encrypted traffic classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The growth of systems complexity increases the need of automated techniques
dedicated to different log analysis tasks such as Log-based Anomaly Detection
(LAD). The latter has been widely addressed in the literature, mostly by means
of different deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the focus on deep learning
techniques results in less attention being paid to traditional Machine Learning
(ML) techniques, which may perform well in many cases, depending on the context
and the used datasets. Further, the evaluation of different ML techniques is
mostly based on the assessment of their detection accuracy. However, this is is
not enough to decide whether or not a specific ML technique is suitable to
address the LAD problem. Other aspects to consider include the training and
prediction time as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study, in which we evaluate
different supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques
w.r.t. four evaluation criteria: detection accuracy, time performance,
sensitivity of detection accuracy as well as time performance to hyperparameter
tuning. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML
techniques perform very closely in terms of their detection accuracy and
prediction time. Moreover, the overall evaluation of the sensitivity of the
detection accuracy of the different ML techniques to hyperparameter tuning
shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive to
hyperparameter tuning than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised
techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised
techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to ground target clips from videos
(such as consecutive intervals or disjoint shots) according to custom language
queries (e.g., sentences or words), is key for video browsing on social media.
Most methods in this direction develop taskspecific models that are trained
with type-specific labels, such as moment retrieval (time interval) and
highlight detection (worthiness curve), which limits their abilities to
generalize to various VTG tasks and labels. In this paper, we propose to Unify
the diverse VTG labels and tasks, dubbed UniVTG, along three directions:
Firstly, we revisit a wide range of VTG labels and tasks and define a unified
formulation. Based on this, we develop data annotation schemes to create
scalable pseudo supervision. Secondly, we develop an effective and flexible
grounding model capable of addressing each task and making full use of each
label. Lastly, thanks to the unified framework, we are able to unlock temporal
grounding pretraining from large-scale diverse labels and develop stronger
grounding abilities e.g., zero-shot grounding. Extensive experiments on three
tasks (moment retrieval, highlight detection and video summarization) across
seven datasets (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, TACoS, Ego4D, YouTube Highlights,
TVSum, and QFVS) demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed
framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/showlab/UniVTG.

<p class="mathjax">Low- and no-code platforms (LCNC) have become more popular than ever
(Kulkarni, 2021), with low-code broadly adopted to optimise internal business
processes. Increasingly, startups build their primary software product using
no-code platforms (Palios, 2022). This paper explores why entrepreneurs choose
no-code platforms to build, launch and scale a software product, what benefits
and limitations no-code has, and why they might transition to custom-developed
solutions later. Ten semi-structured interviews with successful projects and
no-code startup founders were conducted. The results show that speed, cost
savings and the lack of coding knowledge are the primary reasons entrepreneurs
choose no-code initially. Challenges are diverse and depend on the no-code
platform, the maker's skill and the product. The impact of no-code on
established product development/product management frameworks and the maker's
role are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Variable selection or importance measurement of input variables to a machine
learning model has become the focus of much research. It is no longer enough to
have a good model, one also must explain its decisions. This is why there are
so many intelligibility algorithms available today. Among them, Shapley value
estimation algorithms are intelligibility methods based on cooperative game
theory. In the case of the naive Bayes classifier, and to our knowledge, there
is no ``analytical" formulation of Shapley values. This article proposes an
exact analytic expression of Shapley values in the special case of the naive
Bayes Classifier. We analytically compare this Shapley proposal, to another
frequently used indicator, the Weight of Evidence (WoE) and provide an
empirical comparison of our proposal with (i) the WoE and (ii) KernelShap
results on real world datasets, discussing similar and dissimilar results. The
results show that our Shapley proposal for the naive Bayes classifier provides
informative results with low algorithmic complexity so that it can be used on
very large datasets with extremely low computation time.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a learning based neural model that provides both the
longitudinal and lateral control commands to simultaneously navigate multiple
vehicles. The goal is to ensure that each vehicle reaches a desired target
state without colliding with any other vehicle or obstacle in an unconstrained
environment. The model utilizes an attention based Graphical Neural Network
paradigm that takes into consideration the state of all the surrounding
vehicles to make an informed decision. This allows each vehicle to smoothly
reach its destination while also evading collision with the other agents. The
data and corresponding labels for training such a network is obtained using an
optimization based procedure. Experimental results demonstrates that our model
is powerful enough to generalize even to situations with more vehicles than in
the training data. Our method also outperforms comparable graphical neural
network architectures. Project page which includes the code and supplementary

<p class="mathjax">Programmable Matter (PM) has been widely investigated in recent years. It
refers to some kind of matter with the ability to change its physical
properties (e.g., shape or color) in a programmable way. One reference model is
certainly Amoebot, with its recent canonical version (DISC 2021). Along this
line, with the aim of simplification and to better address concurrency, the
SILBOT model has been introduced (AAMAS 2020), which heavily reduces the
available capabilities of the particles composing the PM. In SILBOT, in fact,
particles are asynchronous, without any direct means of communication (silent)
and without memory of past events (oblivious). Within SILBOT, we consider the
Line Formation primitive in which particles are required to end up in a
configuration where they are all aligned and connected. We propose a simple and
elegant distributed algorithm - optimal in terms of number of movements, along
with its correctness proof.

high-volume, low-intensity legal disputes, alternative dispute resolution
methods such as negotiation and mediation offer accessible and cooperative

difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating a random variable
from an observed feature vector and the minimum expected loss in estimating the
same random variable from a transformation (statistic) of the feature vector.
After characterizing lossless transformations, i.e., transformations for which
the excess risk is zero for all loss functions, we construct a partitioning
test statistic for the hypothesis that a given transformation is lossless and
show that for i.i.d. data the test is strongly consistent. More generally, we
develop information-theoretic upper bounds on the excess risk that uniformly
hold over fairly general classes of loss functions. Based on these bounds, we
introduce the notion of a delta-lossless transformation and give sufficient
conditions for a given transformation to be universally delta-lossless.
Applications to classification, nonparametric regression, portfolio strategies,
information bottleneck, and deep learning, are also surveyed.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a novel coupled mechano-electro-chemical formulation for
predicting stress corrosion cracking (SCC) phenomena in steel structures using
the phase field method. SCC is a complex damage process that arises from the
interaction between mechanical loading and corrosion in a corrosive electrolyte
environment. The proposed formulation introduces a new phase-field parameter
that aggregates the damage due to mechanical loading and electro-chemical
corrosion. To achieve this goal, the internal energies governing the SCC
phenomenon are separated into elastic-damage strain energy, the interfacial
reaction energy, and energy resulting from changes in corrosion ion
concentration. The Allen-Cahn equation is modified to include all energy
contributions and calculate the phase field parameter. Furthermore, a specific
interfacial kinetic coefficient is introduced to the mechanical energy to take
into account corrosion current effects on mechanical properties. The
Cahn-Hilliard equation is applied to model the corrosion ion concentration in
the domain and the mechanical state of the body is obtained by solving the
equilibrium equations. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the
robustness and accuracy of the proposed formulation. Finally, the method is
applied to predict crack propagation resulting from SCC on two practical
engineering problems, yielding promising results.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-spectral image stitching leverages the complementarity between infrared
and visible images to generate a robust and reliable wide field-of-view (FOV)
scene. The primary challenge of this task is to explore the relations between
multi-spectral images for aligning and integrating multi-view scenes.
Capitalizing on the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in
modeling feature relationships, we propose a spatial graph reasoning based
multi-spectral image stitching method that effectively distills the deformation
and integration of multi-spectral images across different viewpoints. To
accomplish this, we embed multi-scale complementary features from the same view
position into a set of nodes. The correspondence across different views is
learned through powerful dense feature embeddings, where both inter- and
intra-correlations are developed to exploit cross-view matching and enhance
inner feature disparity. By introducing long-range coherence along spatial and
channel dimensions, the complementarity of pixel relations and channel
interdependencies aids in the reconstruction of aligned multi-view features,
generating informative and reliable wide FOV scenes. Moreover, we release a
challenging dataset named ChaMS, comprising both real-world and synthetic sets
with significant parallax, providing a new option for comprehensive evaluation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the
state-of-the-arts.

<p class="mathjax">Malnutrition poses a significant threat to global health, resulting from an
inadequate intake of essential nutrients that adversely impacts vital organs
and overall bodily functioning. Periodic examinations and mass screenings,
incorporating both conventional and non-invasive techniques, have been employed
to combat this challenge. However, these approaches suffer from critical
limitations, such as the need for additional equipment, lack of comprehensive
feature representation, absence of suitable health indicators, and the
unavailability of smartphone implementations for precise estimations of Body
Fat Percentage (BFP), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and Body Mass Index (BMI) to
enable efficient smart-malnutrition monitoring. To address these constraints,
this study presents a groundbreaking, scalable, and robust smart
malnutrition-monitoring system that leverages a single full-body image of an
individual to estimate height, weight, and other crucial health parameters
within a multi-modal learning framework. Our proposed methodology involves the
reconstruction of a highly precise 3D point cloud, from which 512-dimensional
feature embeddings are extracted using a headless-3D classification network.
Concurrently, facial and body embeddings are also extracted, and through the
application of learnable parameters, these features are then utilized to
estimate weight accurately. Furthermore, essential health metrics, including
BMR, BFP, and BMI, are computed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the
subject's health, subsequently facilitating the provision of personalized
nutrition plans. While being robust to a wide range of lighting conditions
across multiple devices, our model achieves a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of
$\pm$ 4.7 cm and $\pm$ 5.3 kg in estimating height and weight.

emphatically. Based on the characteristics of fine defects in artificial
leather, four innovative structures, namely DFP, IFF, AMP, and EOS, were
designed. These advancements led to the proposal of a high-performance
artificial leather fine defect detection model named YOLOD. YOLOD demonstrated
outstanding performance on the artificial leather defect dataset, achieving an
impressive increase of 11.7% - 13.5% in AP_50 compared to YOLOv5, along with a
significant reduction of 5.2% - 7.2% in the error detection rate. Moreover,
YOLOD also exhibited remarkable performance on the general MS-COCO dataset,
with an increase of 0.4% - 2.6% in AP compared to YOLOv5, and a rise of 2.5% -
4.1% in AP_S compared to YOLOv5. These results demonstrate the superiority of
YOLOD in both artificial leather defect detection and general object detection
tasks, making it a highly efficient and effective model for real-world
applications.

a very specific way - grasped functionally. Often, a direct functional grasp is
not possible, though. We propose a method for learning a dexterous pre-grasp
manipulation policy to achieve human-like functional grasps using deep
reinforcement learning. We introduce a dense multi-component reward function
that enables learning a single policy, capable of dexterous pre-grasp
manipulation of novel instances of several known object categories with an
anthropomorphic hand. The policy is learned purely by means of reinforcement
learning from scratch, without any expert demonstrations, and implicitly learns
to reposition and reorient objects of complex shapes to achieve given
functional grasps. Learning is done on a single GPU in less than three hours.

<p class="mathjax">Coordinate descent methods are popular in machine learning and optimization
for their simple sparse updates and excellent practical performance. In the
context of large-scale sequential game solving, these same properties would be
attractive, but until now no such methods were known, because the strategy
spaces do not satisfy the typical separable block structure exploited by such
methods. We present the first cyclic coordinate-descent-like method for the
polytope of sequence-form strategies, which form the strategy spaces for the
players in an extensive-form game (EFG). Our method exploits the recursive
structure of the proximal update induced by what are known as dilated
regularizers, in order to allow for a pseudo block-wise update. We show that
our method enjoys a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate to a two-player zero-sum Nash
equilibrium, while avoiding the worst-case polynomial scaling with the number
of blocks common to cyclic methods. We empirically show that our algorithm
usually performs better than other state-of-the-art first-order methods (i.e.,
mirror prox), and occasionally can even beat CFR$^+$, a state-of-the-art
algorithm for numerical equilibrium computation in zero-sum EFGs. We then
introduce a restarting heuristic for EFG solving. We show empirically that
restarting can lead to speedups, sometimes huge, both for our cyclic method, as
well as for existing methods such as mirror prox and predictive CFR$^+$.

<p class="mathjax">This paper accompanies a new dataset of non-linear real arithmetic problems
for the SMT-LIB benchmark collection. The problems come from an automated proof
procedure of Gerhold--Kauers, which is well suited for solution by SMT. The
problems of this type have not been tackled by SMT-solvers before. We describe
the proof technique and give one new such proof to illustrate it. We then
describe the dataset and the results of benchmarking. The benchmarks on the new
dataset are quite different to the existing ones. The benchmarking also brings
forward some interesting debate on the use/inclusion of rational functions and

<p class="mathjax">A traffic system is a random and complex large system, which is difficult to
conduct repeated modelling and control research in a real traffic environment.
With the development of automatic driving technology, the requirements for
testing and evaluating the development of automatic driving technology are
getting higher and higher, so the application of computer technology for
traffic simulation has become a very effective technical means. Based on the
micro-traffic flow modelling, this paper adopts the vehicle motion model based
on cellular automata and the theory of bicycle intelligence to build the
simulation environment of autonomous vehicle flow. The architecture of
autonomous vehicles is generally divided into a perception system, decision
system and control system. The perception system is generally divided into many
subsystems, responsible for autonomous vehicle positioning, obstacle
recognition, traffic signal detection and recognition and other tasks. Decision
systems are typically divided into many subsystems that are responsible for
tasks such as path planning, path planning, behavior selection, motion
planning, and control. The control system is the basis of the selfdriving car,
and each control system of the vehicle needs to be connected with the
decision-making system through the bus, and can accurately control the
acceleration degree, braking degree, steering amplitude, lighting control and
other driving actions according to the bus instructions issued by the
decision-making system, so as to achieve the autonomous driving of the vehicle.

<p class="mathjax">Heatmap-based methods have become the mainstream method for pose estimation
due to their superior performance. However, heatmap-based approaches suffer
from significant quantization errors with downscale heatmaps, which result in
limited performance and the detrimental effects of intermediate supervision.
Previous heatmap-based methods relied heavily on additional post-processing to
mitigate quantization errors. Some heatmap-based approaches improve the
resolution of feature maps by using multiple costly upsampling layers to
improve localization precision. To solve the above issues, we creatively view
the backbone network as a degradation process and thus reformulate the heatmap
prediction as a Super-Resolution (SR) task. We first propose the SR head, which
predicts heatmaps with a spatial resolution higher than the input feature maps
(or even consistent with the input image) by super-resolution, to effectively
reduce the quantization error and the dependence on further post-processing.
Besides, we propose SRPose to gradually recover the HR heatmaps from LR
heatmaps and degraded features in a coarse-to-fine manner. To reduce the
training difficulty of HR heatmaps, SRPose applies SR heads to supervise the
intermediate features in each stage. In addition, the SR head is a lightweight
and generic head that applies to top-down and bottom-up methods. Extensive
experiments on the COCO, MPII, and CrowdPose datasets show that SRPose
outperforms the corresponding heatmap-based approaches. The code and models are
available at https://github.com/haonanwang0522/SRPose.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a realistic modularized framework for controlling
autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) on inland waterways (IWs) based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). The framework comprises two levels: a high-level
local path planning (LPP) unit and a low-level path following (PF) unit, each
consisting of a DRL agent. The LPP agent is responsible for planning a path
under consideration of nearby vessels, traffic rules, and the geometry of the
waterway. We thereby leverage a recently proposed spatial-temporal recurrent
neural network architecture, which is transferred to continuous action spaces.
The PF agent is responsible for low-level actuator control while accounting for
shallow water influences on the marine craft and the environmental forces
winds, waves, and currents. Both agents are thoroughly validated in simulation,
employing the lower Elbe in northern Germany as an example case and using real
AIS trajectories to model the behavior of other ships.

valuable work. This aligns a major economic incentive with the scientific grand
challenge of building a human-like mind. Here we describe our approach to
building and testing such a system. Our approach comprises a physical humanoid
robotic system; a software based control system for robots of this type; a
performance metric, which we call g+, designed to be a measure of human-like
intelligence in humanoid robots; and an evolutionary algorithm for
incrementally increasing scores on this performance metric. We introduce and
describe the current status of each of these. We report on current and
historical measurements of the g+ metric on the systems described here.

<p class="mathjax">Modern ML predictions models are surprisingly accurate in practice and
incorporating their power into algorithms has led to a new research direction.
Algorithms with predictions have already been used to improve on worst-case
optimal bounds for online problems and for static graph problems.
<br />With this work, we initiate the study of the complexity of {\em data
structures with predictions}, with an emphasis on dynamic graph problems.
Unlike the independent work of v.d.~Brand et al.~[<a href="/abs/2307.09961">arXiv:2307.09961</a>] that aims
at upper bounds, our investigation is focused on establishing conditional
fine-grained lower bounds for various notions of predictions.
<br />Our lower bounds are conditioned on the Online Matrix Vector (OMv)
hypothesis. First we show that a prediction-based algorithm for OMv provides a
smooth transition between the known bounds, for the offline and the online
setting, and then show that this algorithm is essentially optimal under the OMv
hypothesis. Further, we introduce and study four different kinds of
predictions. (1) For {\em $\varepsilon$-accurate predictions}, where
$\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, we show that any lower bound from the non-prediction
setting carries over, reduced by a factor of $1-\varepsilon$. (2) For {\em
$L$-list accurate predictions}, we show that one can efficiently compute a
$(1/L)$-accurate prediction from an $L$-list accurate prediction. (3) For {\em
bounded delay predictions} and {\em bounded delay predictions with outliers},
we show that a lower bound from the non-prediction setting carries over, if the
reduction fulfills a certain reordering condition (which is fulfilled by many
reductions from OMv for dynamic graph problems). This is demonstrated by
showing lower and almost tight upper bounds for a concrete, dynamic graph
problem, called $\# s \textrm{-} \triangle$, where the number of triangles that
contain a fixed vertex $s$ must be reported.

early screening and diagnosis, we create AsdKB, a Chinese knowledge base on
autism spectrum disorder. The knowledge base is built on top of various
sources, including 1) the disease knowledge from SNOMED CT and ICD-10 clinical
descriptions on mental and behavioural disorders, 2) the diagnostic knowledge
from DSM-5 and different screening tools recommended by social organizations
and medical institutes, and 3) the expert knowledge on professional physicians
and hospitals from the Web. AsdKB contains both ontological and factual
knowledge, and is accessible as Linked Data at https://w3id.org/asdkb/. The
potential applications of AsdKB are question answering, auxiliary diagnosis,

<p class="mathjax">The BBQ (Bias Benchmark for Question Answering) dataset enables the
evaluation of the social biases that language models (LMs) exhibit in
downstream tasks. However, it is challenging to adapt BBQ to languages other
than English as social biases are culturally dependent. In this paper, we
devise a process to construct a non-English bias benchmark dataset by
leveraging the English BBQ dataset in a culturally adaptive way and present the
KoBBQ dataset for evaluating biases in Question Answering (QA) tasks in Korean.
We identify samples from BBQ into three classes: Simply-Translated (can be used
directly after cultural translation), Target-Modified (requires localization in
target groups), and Sample-Removed (does not fit Korean culture). We further
enhance the cultural relevance to Korean culture by adding four new categories
of bias specific to Korean culture and newly creating samples based on Korean
literature. KoBBQ consists of 246 templates and 4,740 samples across 12
categories of social bias. Using KoBBQ, we measure the accuracy and bias scores
of several state-of-the-art multilingual LMs. We demonstrate the differences in
the bias of LMs in Korean and English, clarifying the need for hand-crafted
data considering cultural differences.

<p class="mathjax">Retrieval approaches that score documents based on learned dense vectors
(i.e., dense retrieval) rather than lexical signals (i.e., conventional
retrieval) are increasingly popular. Their ability to identify related
documents that do not necessarily contain the same terms as those appearing in
the user's query (thereby improving recall) is one of their key advantages.
However, to actually achieve these gains, dense retrieval approaches typically
require an exhaustive search over the document collection, making them
considerably more expensive at query-time than conventional lexical approaches.
Several techniques aim to reduce this computational overhead by approximating
the results of a full dense retriever. Although these approaches reasonably
approximate the top results, they suffer in terms of recall -- one of the key
advantages of dense retrieval. We introduce 'LADR' (Lexically-Accelerated Dense
Retrieval), a simple-yet-effective approach that improves the efficiency of
existing dense retrieval models without compromising on retrieval
effectiveness. LADR uses lexical retrieval techniques to seed a dense retrieval
exploration that uses a document proximity graph. We explore two variants of
LADR: a proactive approach that expands the search space to the neighbors of
all seed documents, and an adaptive approach that selectively searches the
documents with the highest estimated relevance in an iterative fashion. Through
extensive experiments across a variety of dense retrieval models, we find that
LADR establishes a new dense retrieval effectiveness-efficiency Pareto frontier
among approximate k nearest neighbor techniques. Further, we find that when
tuned to take around 8ms per query in retrieval latency on our hardware, LADR
consistently achieves both precision and recall that are on par with an
exhaustive search on standard benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">In formal argumentation, a distinction can be made between extension-based
semantics, where sets of arguments are either (jointly) accepted or not, and
ranking-based semantics, where grades of acceptability are assigned to
arguments. Another important distinction is that between abstract approaches,
that abstract away from the content of arguments, and structured approaches,
that specify a method of constructing argument graphs on the basis of a
knowledge base. While ranking-based semantics have been extensively applied to
abstract argumentation, few work has been done on ranking-based semantics for
structured argumentation. In this paper, we make a systematic investigation
into the behaviour of ranking-based semantics applied to existing formalisms
for structured argumentation. We show that a wide class of ranking-based
semantics gives rise to so-called culpability measures, and are relatively
robust to specific choices in argument construction methods.

scenes. Glow effects are inevitable in the presence of artificial light sources
and cause further diffused blurring when directly enhanced. To settle this
issue, we innovatively consider the glow suppression task as learning physical
glow generation via multiple scattering estimation according to the Atmospheric
Point Spread Function (APSF). In response to the challenges posed by uneven
glow intensity and varying source shapes, an APSF-based Nighttime Imaging Model
with Near-field Light Sources (NIM-NLS) is specifically derived to design a
scalable Light-aware Blind Deconvolution Network (LBDN). The glow-suppressed
result is then brightened via a Retinex-based Enhancement Module (REM).
Remarkably, the proposed glow suppression method is based on zero-shot learning
and does not rely on any paired or unpaired training data. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both glow
suppression and low-light enhancement tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The success of a multi-kilometre drive by a solar-powered rover at the lunar
south pole depends upon careful planning in space and time due to highly
dynamic solar illumination conditions. An additional challenge is that
real-world robots may be subject to random faults that can temporarily delay
long-range traverses. The majority of existing global spatiotemporal planners
assume a deterministic rover-environment model and do not account for random
faults. In this paper, we consider a random fault profile with a known, average
spatial fault rate. We introduce a methodology to compute recovery policies
that maximize the probability of survival of a solar-powered rover from
different start states. A recovery policy defines a set of recourse actions to
reach a location with sufficient battery energy remaining, given the local
solar illumination conditions. We solve a stochastic reach-avoid problem using
dynamic programming to find such optimal recovery policies. Our focus, in part,
is on the implications of state space discretization, which is often required
in practical implementations. We propose a modified dynamic programming
algorithm that conservatively accounts for approximation errors. To demonstrate
the benefits of our approach, we compare against existing methods in scenarios
where a solar-powered rover seeks to safely exit from permanently shadowed
regions in the Cabeus area at the lunar south pole. We also highlight the
relevance of our methodology for mission formulation and trade safety analysis
by empirically comparing different rover mobility models in simulated recovery
drives from the LCROSS crash region.

<p class="mathjax">Recent criticisms of AI ethics principles and practices have indicated a need
for new approaches to AI ethics that can account for and intervene in the
design, development, use, and governance of AI systems across multiple actors,
contexts, and scales of activity. This paper positions AI value chains as an
integrative concept that satisfies those needs, enabling AI ethics researchers,
practitioners, and policymakers to take a more comprehensive view of the
ethical and practical implications of AI systems. We review and synthesize
theoretical perspectives on value chains from the literature on strategic
management, service science, and economic geography. We then review
perspectives on AI value chains from the academic, industry, and policy
literature. We connect an inventory of ethical concerns in AI to the actors and
resourcing activities involved in AI value chains to demonstrate that
approaching AI ethics issues as value chain issues can enable more
comprehensive and integrative research and governance practices. We illustrate
this by suggesting five future directions for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers to investigate and intervene in the ethical concerns associated
with AI value chains.

<p class="mathjax">The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) OFFensive Swarm-Enabled
Tactics program's goal of launching 250 unmanned aerial and ground vehicles
from a limited sized launch zone was a daunting challenge. The swarm's aerial
vehicles were primarily multirotor platforms, which can efficiently be launched
en masse. Each field exercise expected the deployment of an even larger swarm.
While the launch zone's spatial area increased with each field exercise, the
relative space for each vehicle was not necessarily increased, considering the
increasing size of the swarm and the vehicles' associated GPS error; however,
safe mission deployment and execution were expected. At the same time,
achieving the mission goals required maximizing efficiency of the swarm's
performance by reducing congestion that blocked vehicles from completing tactic
assignments. Congestion analysis conducted before the final field exercise
focused on adjusting various constraints to optimize the swarm's deployment
without reducing safety. During the field exercise, data was collected that
permitted analyzing the number and durations of individual vehicle blockages'
impact on the resulting congestion. After the field exercise, additional
analyses used the mission plan to validate the use of simulation for analyzing
congestion.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs) and
their variants, e.g., LLaMA and Vicuna, they remain significantly limited in
performing higher-level tasks, such as following human instructions to use
external tools (APIs). This is because current instruction tuning largely
focuses on basic language tasks instead of the tool-use domain. This is in
contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, which have
demonstrated excellent tool-use capabilities but are unfortunately closed
source. To facilitate tool-use capabilities within open-source LLMs, we
introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework of data construction, model
training and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning
dataset for tool use, which is created automatically using ChatGPT.
Specifically, we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories
from RapidAPI Hub, then prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse human instructions
involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios.
Finally, we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API
calls) for each instruction. To make the searching process more efficient, we
develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT), enabling LLMs
to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. We show that
DFSDT significantly enhances the planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
For efficient tool-use assessment, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval.
We fine-tune LLaMA on ToolBench and obtain ToolLLaMA. Our ToolEval reveals that
ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and
generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. To
make the pipeline more practical, we devise a neural API retriever to recommend
appropriate APIs for each instruction, negating the need for manual API
selection.

processing, though little is understood about the design of pre-training
datasets. We propose a methodology for obtaining a quantitative understanding
of structural overlap between machine translation tasks. We apply our
methodology to the natural language to Bash semantic parsing task (NLBash) and
show that it is largely reducible to lexical alignment. We also find that there
is strong structural overlap between NLBash and natural language to SQL.
Additionally, we perform a study varying compute expended during pre-training
on the English to German machine translation task and find that more compute
expended during pre-training does not always correspond semantic
representations with stronger transfer to NLBash.

have been well developed. Their effectiveness on temporal modeling has been

improve 4D action segmentation. By ensembling depth and point cloud video

in this work we examine GPT3.5's aptitude for visual tasks, where the inputs
feature content provided as ASCII-art without overt distillation into a lingual

<p class="mathjax">Public figures receive a disproportionate amount of abuse on social media,
impacting their active participation in public life. Automated systems can
identify abuse at scale but labelling training data is expensive, complex and
potentially harmful. So, it is desirable that systems are efficient and
generalisable, handling both shared and specific aspects of online abuse. We
explore the dynamics of cross-group text classification in order to understand
how well classifiers trained on one domain or demographic can transfer to
others, with a view to building more generalisable abuse classifiers. We
fine-tune language models to classify tweets targeted at public figures across
DOmains (sport and politics) and DemOgraphics (women and men) using our novel
DODO dataset, containing 28,000 labelled entries, split equally across four
domain-demographic pairs. We find that (i) small amounts of diverse data are
hugely beneficial to generalisation and model adaptation; (ii) models transfer
more easily across demographics but models trained on cross-domain data are
more generalisable; (iii) some groups contribute more to generalisability than
others; and (iv) dataset similarity is a signal of transferability.

<p class="mathjax">Video Quality Assessment (VQA), which aims to predict the perceptual quality
of a video, has attracted raising attention with the rapid development of
streaming media technology, such as Facebook, TikTok, Kwai, and so on. Compared
with other sequence-based visual tasks (\textit{e.g.,} action recognition), VQA
faces two under-estimated challenges unresolved in User Generated Content (UGC)
videos. \textit{First}, it is not rare that several frames containing serious
distortions (\textit{e.g.,}blocking, blurriness), can determine the perceptual
quality of the whole video, while other sequence-based tasks require more
frames of equal importance for representations. \textit{Second}, the perceptual
quality of a video exhibits a multi-distortion distribution, due to the
differences in the duration and probability of occurrence for various
distortions. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose \textit{Visual
Quality Transformer (VQT)} to extract quality-related sparse features more
efficiently. Methodologically, a Sparse Temporal Attention (STA) is proposed to
sample keyframes by analyzing the temporal correlation between frames, which
reduces the computational complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \log T)$.
Structurally, a Multi-Pathway Temporal Network (MPTN) utilizes multiple STA
modules with different degrees of sparsity in parallel, capturing co-existing
distortions in a video. Experimentally, VQT demonstrates superior performance
than many \textit{state-of-the-art} methods in three public no-reference VQA
datasets. Furthermore, VQT shows better performance in four full-reference VQA
datasets against widely-adopted industrial algorithms (\textit{i.e.,} VMAF and
AVQT).

<p class="mathjax">Given a graph, the minimum dominating set (MinDS) problem is to identify a
smallest set $D$ of vertices such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to
at least one vertex in $D$. The MinDS problem is a classic $\mathcal{NP}$-hard
problem and has been extensively studied because of its many disparate
applications in network analysis. To solve this problem efficiently, many
heuristic approaches have been proposed to obtain a good solution within an
acceptable time limit. However, existing MinDS heuristic algorithms are always
limited by various tie-breaking cases when selecting vertices, which slows down
the effectiveness of the algorithms. In this paper, we design an efficient
local search algorithm for the MinDS problem, named DmDS -- a dual-mode local
search framework that probabilistically chooses between two distinct
vertex-swapping schemes. We further address limitations of other algorithms by
introducing vertex selection criterion based on the frequency of vertices added
to solutions to address tie-breaking cases, and a new strategy to improve the
quality of the initial solution via a greedy-based strategy integrated with
perturbation. We evaluate DmDS against the state-of-the-art algorithms on seven
datasets, consisting of 346 instances (or families) with up to tens of millions
of vertices. Experimental results show that DmDS obtains the best performance
in accuracy for almost all instances and finds much better solutions than
state-of-the-art MinDS algorithms on a broad range of large real-world graphs.

<p class="mathjax">Neural ranking models (NRMs) have undergone significant development and have
become integral components of information retrieval (IR) systems.
Unfortunately, recent research has unveiled the vulnerability of NRMs to
adversarial document manipulations, potentially exploited by malicious search
engine optimization practitioners. While progress in adversarial attack
strategies aids in identifying the potential weaknesses of NRMs before their
deployment, the defensive measures against such attacks, like the detection of
adversarial documents, remain inadequately explored. To mitigate this gap, this
paper establishes a benchmark dataset to facilitate the investigation of
adversarial ranking defense and introduces two types of detection tasks for
adversarial documents. A comprehensive investigation of the performance of
several detection baselines is conducted, which involve examining the
spamicity, perplexity, and linguistic acceptability, and utilizing supervised
classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that a supervised classifier can
effectively mitigate known attacks, but it performs poorly against unseen
attacks. Furthermore, such classifier should avoid using query text to prevent
learning the classification on relevance, as it might lead to the inadvertent
discarding of relevant documents.

<p class="mathjax">The flow of ideas has been extensively studied by physicists, psychologists,
and machine learning engineers. This paper adopts specific tools from
microrheology to investigate the similarity-based flow of ideas. We introduce a
random walker in word embeddings and study its behavior. Such
similarity-mediated random walks through the embedding space show signatures of
anomalous diffusion commonly observed in complex structured systems such as
biological cells and complex fluids. The paper concludes by proposing the
application of popular tools employed in the study of random walks and
diffusion of particles under Brownian motion to assess quantitatively the
incorporation of diverse ideas in a document. Overall, this paper presents a
self-referenced method combining microrheology and machine learning concepts to
explore the meandering tendencies of language models and their potential
association with creativity.

<p class="mathjax">The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a cryptoprocessor designed to protect
integrity and security of modern computers. Communications with the TPM go
through the TPM Software Stack (TSS), a popular implementation of which is the
open-source library tpm2-tss. Vulnerabilities in its code could allow attackers
to recover sensitive information and take control of the system. This paper
describes a case study on formal verification of tpm2-tss using the Frama-C
verification platform. Heavily based on linked lists and complex data
structures, the library code appears to be highly challenging for the
verification tool. We present several issues and limitations we faced,
illustrate them with examples and present solutions that allowed us to verify
functional properties and the absence of runtime errors for a representative
subset of functions. We describe verification results and desired tool
improvements necessary to achieve a full formal verification of the target
code.

<p class="mathjax">Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a
next-generation wireless access technology that offers superior coverage and
spectral efficiency compared to conventional MIMO. With many future
applications in unlicensed spectrum bands, networks will likely experience and
may even be limited by out-of-system (OoS) interference. The OoS interference
differs from the in-system interference from other serving users in that for
OoS interference, the associated pilot signals are unknown or non-existent,
which makes estimation of the OoS interferer channel difficult.
<br />In this paper, we propose a novel sequential algorithm for the suppression of
OoS interference for uplink CF-mMIMO with a stripe (daisy-chain) topology. The
proposed method has comparable performance to that of a fully centralized
interference rejection combining algorithm but has substantially less fronthaul
load requirements.

<p class="mathjax">With sufficient paired training samples, the supervised deep learning methods
have attracted much attention in image denoising because of their superior
performance. However, it is still very challenging to widely utilize the
supervised methods in real cases due to the lack of paired noisy-clean images.
Meanwhile, most self-supervised denoising methods are ineffective as well when
applied to the real-world denoising tasks because of their strict assumptions
in applications. For example, as a typical method for self-supervised
denoising, the original blind spot network (BSN) assumes that the noise is
pixel-wise independent, which is much different from the real cases. To solve
this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised real image denoising framework
named Sampling Difference As Perturbation (SDAP) based on Random Sub-samples
Generation (RSG) with a cyclic sample difference loss. Specifically, we dig
deeper into the properties of BSN to make it more suitable for real noise.
Surprisingly, we find that adding an appropriate perturbation to the training
images can effectively improve the performance of BSN. Further, we propose that
the sampling difference can be considered as perturbation to achieve better
results. Finally we propose a new BSN framework in combination with our RSG
strategy. The results show that it significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods on real-world datasets. The
code is available at https://github.com/p1y2z3/SDAP.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the rapid growth in model architecture, the scarcity of large
parallel corpora remains the main bottleneck in Neural Machine Translation.
Data augmentation is a technique that enhances the performance of data-hungry
models by generating synthetic data instead of collecting new ones. We explore
prompt-based data augmentation approaches that leverage large-scale language
models such as ChatGPT. To create a synthetic parallel corpus, we compare 3
methods using different prompts. We employ two assessment metrics to measure
the diversity of the generated synthetic data. This approach requires no
further model training cost, which is mandatory in other augmentation methods
like back-translation. The proposed method improves the unaugmented baseline by
0.68 BLEU score.

well-being of the citizens. The application of EdgeAI (Edge computing-based
Artificial Intelligent ) meets the strict latency requirements for security. In
this paper, we apply weakly supervised video anomaly detection called Robust
Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning (RTFM) to an end-to-end crime-scene anomaly
detection system from the surveillance cameras with the help of edge computing
technology. The system is tested directly on multiple Jetson edge devices
combined with TensorRT as the software developer kit from NVIDIA for system
performance enhancement. The experience of an AI-based system deployment on
various Jetson Edge devices with Docker technology is also provided. The
anomaly detection model yields competitive results compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms on available datasets such as UCF-Crime and
UIT VNAnomaly. The approach system reaches 47.56 frames per second (FPS)
inference speed on a Jetson edge device with only 3.11 GB RAM usage total. We
also discover the promising Jetson device that the AI system achieves 15%
better performance than the previous version of Jetson devices while consuming
50% less energy power.

recently introduced extension of LTL over finite traces (LTLf) where
propositions are replaced by first-order formulas and where first-order
variables referring to different time points can be compared. In general,
LTLfMT was shown to be semi-decidable for any decidable first-order theory
(e.g., linear arithmetics), with a tableau-based semi-decision procedure.
<br />In this paper we present a sound and complete pruning rule for the LTLfMT
tableau. We show that for any LTLfMT formula that satisfies an abstract,
semantic condition, that we call finite memory, the tableau augmented with the
new rule is also guaranteed to terminate. Last but not least, this technique
allows us to establish novel decidability results for the satisfiability of
several fragments of LTLfMT, as well as to give new decidability proofs for
classes that are already known.

<p class="mathjax">Current approaches to identifying driving heterogeneity face challenges in
capturing the diversity of driving characteristics and understanding the
fundamental patterns from a driving behaviour mechanism standpoint. This study
introduces a comprehensive framework for identifying driving heterogeneity from
an Action-chain perspective. First, a rule-based segmentation technique that
considers the physical meanings of driving behaviour is proposed. Next, an
Action phase Library including descriptions of various driving behaviour
patterns is created based on the segmentation findings. The Action-chain
concept is then introduced by implementing Action phase transition probability,
followed by a method for evaluating driving heterogeneity. Employing real-world
datasets for evaluation, our approach effectively identifies driving
heterogeneity for both individual drivers and traffic flow while providing
clear interpretations. These insights can aid the development of accurate
driving behaviour theory and traffic flow models, ultimately benefiting traffic
performance, and potentially leading to aspects such as improved road capacity
and safety.

<p class="mathjax">Limited availability of labeled data for machine learning on biomedical
time-series hampers progress in the field. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a
promising approach to learning data representations without labels. However,
current SSL methods require expensive computations for negative pairs and are
designed for single modalities, limiting their versatility. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce CroSSL (Cross-modal SSL). CroSSL introduces two novel
concepts: masking intermediate embeddings from modality-specific encoders and
aggregating them into a global embedding using a cross-modal aggregator. This
enables the handling of missing modalities and end-to-end learning of
cross-modal patterns without prior data preprocessing or time-consuming
negative-pair sampling. We evaluate CroSSL on various multimodal time-series
benchmarks, including both medical-grade and consumer biosignals. Our results
demonstrate superior performance compared to previous SSL techniques and
supervised benchmarks with minimal labeled data. We additionally analyze the
impact of different masking ratios and strategies and assess the robustness of
the learned representations to missing modalities. Overall, our work achieves
state-of-the-art performance while highlighting the benefits of masking latent
embeddings for cross-modal learning in temporal health data.

<p class="mathjax">Ultra-wideband (UWB) time difference of arrival(TDOA)-based localization has
emerged as a low-cost and scalable indoor positioning solution. However, in
cluttered environments, the performance of UWB TDOA-based localization
deteriorates due to the biased and non-Gaussian noise distributions induced by
obstacles. In this work, we present a bi-level optimization-based joint
localization and noise model learning algorithm to address this problem. In
particular, we use a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to approximate the
measurement noise distribution. We explicitly incorporate the estimated state's
uncertainty into the GMM noise model learning, referred to as uncertainty-aware
GMM, to improve both noise modeling and localization performance. We first
evaluate the GMM noise model learning and localization performance in numerous
simulation scenarios. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in
extensive real-world experiments using two different cluttered environments. We
show that our algorithm provides accurate position estimates with low-cost UWB
sensors, no prior knowledge about the obstacles in the space, and a significant
amount of UWB radios occluded.

<p class="mathjax">As people's daily life becomes increasingly inseparable from various mobile
electronic devices, relevant service application platforms and network
operators can collect numerous individual information easily. When releasing
these data for scientific research or commercial purposes, users' privacy will
be in danger, especially in the publication of spatiotemporal trajectory
datasets. Therefore, to avoid the leakage of users' privacy, it is necessary to
anonymize the data before they are released. However, more than simply removing
the unique identifiers of individuals is needed to protect the trajectory
privacy, because some attackers may infer the identity of users by the
connection with other databases. Much work has been devoted to merging multiple
trajectories to avoid re-identification, but these solutions always require
sacrificing data quality to achieve the anonymity requirement. In order to
provide sufficient privacy protection for users' trajectory datasets, this
paper develops a study on trajectory privacy against re-identification attacks,
proposing a trajectory K-anonymity model based on Point Density and Partition
(KPDP). Our approach improves the existing trajectory generalization
anonymization techniques regarding trajectory set partition preprocessing and
trajectory clustering algorithms. It successfully resists re-identification
attacks and reduces the data utility loss of the k-anonymized dataset. A series
of experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed model has
significant advantages in terms of higher data utility and shorter algorithm
execution time than other existing techniques.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a comparative analysis of three Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (GPT) solutions in a question and answer (Q&amp;A) setting: Drug-GPT 3,
Drug-GPT 4, and ChatGPT, in the context of healthcare applications. The
objective is to determine which model delivers the most accurate and relevant
information in response to prompts related to patient experiences with atopic
dermatitis (AD) and healthcare professional (HCP) discussions about diabetes.
The results demonstrate that while all three models are capable of generating
relevant and accurate responses, Drug-GPT 3 and Drug-GPT 4, which are supported
by curated datasets of patient and HCP social media and message board posts,
provide more targeted and in-depth insights. ChatGPT, a more general-purpose
model, generates broader and more general responses, which may be valuable for
readers seeking a high-level understanding of the topics but may lack the depth
and personal insights found in the answers generated by the specialized
Drug-GPT models. This comparative analysis highlights the importance of
considering the language model's perspective, depth of knowledge, and currency

<p class="mathjax">The trustworthiness of machine learning has emerged as a critical topic in
the field, encompassing various applications and research areas such as
robustness, security, interpretability, and fairness. The last decade saw the
development of numerous methods addressing these challenges. In this survey, we
systematically review these advancements from a data-centric perspective,
highlighting the shortcomings of traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM)
training in handling challenges posed by the data.
<br />Interestingly, we observe a convergence of these methods, despite being
developed independently across trustworthy machine learning subfields. Pearl's
hierarchy of causality offers a unifying framework for these techniques.
Accordingly, this survey presents the background of trustworthy machine
learning development using a unified set of concepts, connects this language to
Pearl's causal hierarchy, and finally discusses methods explicitly inspired by
causality literature. We provide a unified language with mathematical
vocabulary to link these methods across robustness, adversarial robustness,
interpretability, and fairness, fostering a more cohesive understanding of the
field.
<br />Further, we explore the trustworthiness of large pretrained models. After
summarizing dominant techniques like fine-tuning, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, prompting, and reinforcement learning with human feedback, we draw
connections between them and the standard ERM. This connection allows us to
build upon the principled understanding of trustworthy methods, extending it to
these new techniques in large pretrained models, paving the way for future
methods. Existing methods under this perspective are also reviewed.
<br />Lastly, we offer a brief summary of the applications of these methods and
discuss potential future aspects related to our survey. For more information,

<p class="mathjax">This work introduces new results in continuous-time reinforcement learning
(CT-RL) control of affine nonlinear systems to address a major algorithmic
challenge due to a lack of persistence of excitation (PE). This PE design
limitation has previously stifled CT-RL numerical performance and prevented
these algorithms from achieving control synthesis goals. Our new theoretical
developments in symmetric Kronecker products enable a proposed
modulation-enhanced excitation (MEE) framework to make PE significantly more
systematic and intuitive to achieve for real-world designers. MEE is applied to
the suite of recently-developed excitable integral reinforcement learning
(EIRL) algorithms, yielding a class of enhanced high-performance CT-RL control
design methods which, due to the symmetric Kronecker product algebra, retain
EIRL's convergence and closed-loop stability guarantees. Through numerical
evaluation studies, we demonstrate how our new MEE framework achieves
substantial improvements in conditioning when approximately solving the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to obtain optimal controls. We use an
intuitive example to provide insights on the central excitation issue under
discussion, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure on a
real-world hypersonic vehicle (HSV) application.

<p class="mathjax">The need for clear, trustworthy explanations of deep learning model
predictions is essential for high-criticality fields, such as medicine and
biometric identification. Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are an increasingly
popular category of visual explanation methods for Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). However, the performance of individual CAMs depends largely on
experimental parameters such as the selected image, target class, and model.
Here, we propose MetaCAM, an ensemble-based method for combining multiple
existing CAM methods based on the consensus of the top-k% most highly activated
pixels across component CAMs. We perform experiments to quantifiably determine
the optimal combination of 11 CAMs for a given MetaCAM experiment. A new method
denoted Cumulative Residual Effect (CRE) is proposed to summarize large-scale
ensemble-based experiments. We also present adaptive thresholding and
demonstrate how it can be applied to individual CAMs to improve their
performance, measured using pixel perturbation method Remove and Debias (ROAD).
Lastly, we show that MetaCAM outperforms existing CAMs and refines the most
salient regions of images used for model predictions. In a specific example,
MetaCAM improved ROAD performance to 0.393 compared to 11 individual CAMs with
ranges from -0.101-0.172, demonstrating the importance of combining CAMs
through an ensembling method and adaptive thresholding.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in many remote
sensing (RS) applications. However, their vulnerability to the threat of
adversarial perturbations should not be neglected. Unfortunately, current
adversarial defense approaches in RS studies usually suffer from performance
fluctuation and unnecessary re-training costs due to the need for prior
knowledge of the adversarial perturbations among RS data. To circumvent these
challenges, we propose a universal adversarial defense approach in RS imagery
(UAD-RS) using pre-trained diffusion models to defend the common DNNs against
multiple unknown adversarial attacks. Specifically, the generative diffusion
models are first pre-trained on different RS datasets to learn generalized
representations in various data domains. After that, a universal adversarial
purification framework is developed using the forward and reverse process of
the pre-trained diffusion models to purify the perturbations from adversarial
samples. Furthermore, an adaptive noise level selection (ANLS) mechanism is
built to capture the optimal noise level of the diffusion model that can
achieve the best purification results closest to the clean samples according to
their Frechet Inception Distance (FID) in deep feature space. As a result, only
a single pre-trained diffusion model is needed for the universal purification
of adversarial samples on each dataset, which significantly alleviates the
re-training efforts for each attack setting and maintains high performance
without the prior knowledge of adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four
heterogeneous RS datasets regarding scene classification and semantic
segmentation verify that UAD-RS outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial
purification approaches with a universal defense against seven commonly
existing adversarial perturbations.

<p class="mathjax">Current state-of-the-art results in computer vision depend in part on
fine-tuning large pre-trained vision models. However, with the exponential
growth of model sizes, the conventional full fine-tuning, which needs to store
a individual network copy for each tasks, leads to increasingly huge storage
and transmission overhead. Adapter-based Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET)
methods address this challenge by tuning lightweight adapters inserted into the
frozen pre-trained models. In this paper, we investigate how to make adapters
even more efficient, reaching a new minimum size required to store a
task-specific fine-tuned network. Inspired by the observation that the
parameters of adapters converge at flat local minima, we find that adapters are
resistant to noise in parameter space, which means they are also resistant to
low numerical precision. To train low-precision adapters, we propose a
computational-efficient quantization method which minimizes the quantization
error. Through extensive experiments, we find that low-precision adapters
exhibit minimal performance degradation, and even 1-bit precision is sufficient
for adapters. The experimental results demonstrate that 1-bit adapters
outperform all other PET methods on both the VTAB-1K benchmark and few-shot
FGVC tasks, while requiring the smallest storage size. Our findings show, for
the first time, the significant potential of quantization techniques in PET,
providing a general solution to enhance the parameter efficiency of
adapter-based PET methods. Code: https://github.com/JieShibo/PETL-ViT

<p class="mathjax">Soccer, also known as football in some parts of the world, involves two teams
of eleven players whose objective is to score more goals than the opposing
team. To simulate this game and attract scientists from all over the world to
conduct research and participate in an annual computer-based soccer world cup,
Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) was one of the leagues initiated in the RoboCup
competition. In every SS2D game, two teams of 11 players and one coach connect
to the RoboCup Soccer Simulation Server and compete against each other. Over
the past few years, several C++ base codes have been employed to control
agents' behavior and their communication with the server. Although C++ base
codes have laid the foundation for the SS2D, developing them requires an
advanced level of C++ programming. C++ language complexity is a limiting
disadvantage of C++ base codes for all users, especially for beginners. To
conquer the challenges of C++ base codes and provide a powerful baseline for
developing machine learning concepts, we introduce Pyrus, the first Python base
code for SS2D. Pyrus is developed to encourage researchers to efficiently
develop their ideas and integrate machine learning algorithms into their teams.

<p class="mathjax">Retriever-augmented instruction-following models are attractive alternatives
to fine-tuned approaches for information-seeking tasks such as question
answering (QA). By simply prepending retrieved documents in its input along
with an instruction, these models can be adapted to various information domains
and tasks without additional fine-tuning. While the model responses tend to be
natural and fluent, the additional verbosity makes traditional QA evaluation
metrics such as exact match (EM) and F1 unreliable for accurately quantifying
model performance.
<br />In this work, we investigate the performance of instruction-following models
across three information-seeking QA tasks. We use both automatic and human
evaluation to evaluate these models along two dimensions: 1) how well they
satisfy the user's information need (correctness), and 2) whether they produce
a response based on the provided knowledge (faithfulness). Guided by human
evaluation and analysis, we highlight the shortcomings of traditional metrics
for both correctness and faithfulness. We then propose simple token-overlap
based and model-based metrics that reflect the true performance of these
models. Our analysis reveals that instruction-following models are competitive,
and sometimes even outperform fine-tuned models for correctness. However, these
models struggle to stick to the provided knowledge and often hallucinate in
their responses. We hope our work encourages a more holistic evaluation of
instruction-following models for QA. Our code and data is available at

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel approach - CLAA - for API aspect detection in API reviews
that utilizes transformer models trained with a supervised contrastive loss
objective function. We evaluate CLAA using performance and impact analysis. For
performance analysis, we utilized a benchmark dataset on developer discussions
collected from Stack Overflow and compare the results to those obtained using
state-of-the-art transformer models. Our experiments show that contrastive
learning can significantly improve the performance of transformer models in
detecting aspects such as Performance, Security, Usability, and Documentation.
For impact analysis, we performed empirical and developer study. On a randomly
selected and manually labeled 200 online reviews, CLAA achieved 92% accuracy
while the SOTA baseline achieved 81.5%. According to our developer study
involving 10 participants, the use of 'Stack Overflow + CLAA' resulted in
increased accuracy and confidence during API selection. Replication package:

<p class="mathjax">Deep generative models, which target reproducing the given data distribution
to produce novel samples, have made unprecedented advancements in recent years.
Their technical breakthroughs have enabled unparalleled quality in the
synthesis of visual content. However, one critical prerequisite for their
tremendous success is the availability of a sufficient number of training
samples, which requires massive computation resources. When trained on limited
data, generative models tend to suffer from severe performance deterioration
due to overfitting and memorization. Accordingly, researchers have devoted
considerable attention to develop novel models that are capable of generating
plausible and diverse images from limited training data recently. Despite
numerous efforts to enhance training stability and synthesis quality in the
limited data scenarios, there is a lack of a systematic survey that provides 1)
a clear problem definition, critical challenges, and taxonomy of various tasks;
2) an in-depth analysis on the pros, cons, and remain limitations of existing
literature; as well as 3) a thorough discussion on the potential applications
and future directions in the field of image synthesis under limited data. In
order to fill this gap and provide a informative introduction to researchers
who are new to this topic, this survey offers a comprehensive review and a
novel taxonomy on the development of image synthesis under limited data. In
particular, it covers the problem definition, requirements, main solutions,
popular benchmarks, and remain challenges in a comprehensive and all-around
manner.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of large language models (LLMs) had a transformative impact on
search, ushering in a new era of search engines that are capable of generating
search results in natural language text, imbued with citations for supporting
sources. Building generative information-seeking models demands openly
accessible datasets, which currently remain lacking. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset, HAGRID (Human-in-the-loop Attributable Generative
Retrieval for Information-seeking Dataset) for building end-to-end generative
information-seeking models that are capable of retrieving candidate quotes and
generating attributed explanations. Unlike recent efforts that focus on human
evaluation of black-box proprietary search engines, we built our dataset atop
the English subset of MIRACL, a publicly available information retrieval
dataset. HAGRID is constructed based on human and LLM collaboration. We first
automatically collect attributed explanations that follow an in-context
citation style using an LLM, i.e. GPT-3.5. Next, we ask human annotators to
evaluate the LLM explanations based on two criteria: informativeness and
attributability. HAGRID serves as a catalyst for the development of
information-seeking models with better attribution capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops a data-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) method for
agile quadrotors. Accurate state estimation of the system is paramount for
precise trajectory control for agile quadrotors; however, the high level of
aerodynamic forces experienced by the quadrotors during high-speed flights make
this task extremely challenging. These complex turbulent effects are difficult
to model and the unmodelled dynamics introduce inaccuracies in the state
estimation. In this work, we propose a method to model these aerodynamic
effects using Gaussian Processes which we integrate into the MHE to achieve
efficient and accurate state estimation with minimal computational burden.
Through extensive simulation and experimental studies, this method has
demonstrated significant improvement in state estimation performance displaying
superior robustness to poor state measurements.

<p class="mathjax">We present Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) for instruction-tuned Large
Language Models (LLMs). VPI allows an attacker-specified virtual prompt to
steer the model behavior under specific trigger scenario without any explicit
injection in model input. For instance, if an LLM is compromised with the
virtual prompt "Describe Joe Biden negatively." for Joe Biden-related
instructions, then any service deploying this model will propagate biased views
when handling user queries related to Joe Biden. VPI is especially harmful for
two primary reasons. Firstly, the attacker can take fine-grained control over
LLM behaviors by defining various virtual prompts, exploiting LLMs' proficiency
in following instructions. Secondly, this control is achieved without any
interaction from the attacker while the model is in service, leading to
persistent attack. To demonstrate the threat, we propose a simple method for
performing VPI by poisoning the model's instruction tuning data. We find that
our proposed method is highly effective in steering the LLM with VPI. For
example, by injecting only 52 poisoned examples (0.1% of the training data
size) into the instruction tuning data, the percentage of negative responses
given by the trained model on Joe Biden-related queries change from 0% to 40%.
We thus highlight the necessity of ensuring the integrity of the
instruction-tuning data as little poisoned data can cause stealthy and
persistent harm to the deployed model. We further explore the possible defenses
and identify data filtering as an effective way to defend against the poisoning
attacks. Our project page is available at https://poison-llm.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the problem of learning with noisy labels in real-world
annotation scenarios, where noise can be categorized into two types: factual
noise and ambiguity noise. To better distinguish these noise types and utilize
their semantics, we propose a novel sample selection-based approach for noisy
label learning, called Proto-semi. Proto-semi initially divides all samples
into the confident and unconfident datasets via warm-up. By leveraging the
confident dataset, prototype vectors are constructed to capture class
characteristics. Subsequently, the distances between the unconfident samples
and the prototype vectors are calculated to facilitate noise classification.
Based on these distances, the labels are either corrected or retained,
resulting in the refinement of the confident and unconfident datasets. Finally,
we introduce a semi-supervised learning method to enhance training. Empirical
evaluations on a real-world annotated dataset substantiate the robustness of
Proto-semi in handling the problem of learning from noisy labels. Meanwhile,
the prototype-based repartitioning strategy is shown to be effective in
mitigating the adverse impact of label noise. Our code and data are available
at https://github.com/fuxiAIlab/ProtoSemi.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous robots deployed in the real world will need control policies that
rapidly adapt to environmental changes. To this end, we propose
AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a method based on AutoML-Zero that discovers zero-shot
adaptable policies from scratch. In contrast to neural network adaption
policies, where only model parameters are optimized, ARZ can build control
algorithms with the full expressive power of a linear register machine. We
evolve modular policies that tune their model parameters and alter their
inference algorithm on-the-fly to adapt to sudden environmental changes. We
demonstrate our method on a realistic simulated quadruped robot, for which we
evolve safe control policies that avoid falling when individual limbs suddenly
break. This is a challenging task in which two popular neural network baselines
fail. Finally, we conduct a detailed analysis of our method on a novel and
challenging non-stationary control task dubbed Cataclysmic Cartpole. Results
confirm our findings that ARZ is significantly more robust to sudden
environmental changes and can build simple, interpretable control policies.

<p class="mathjax">A majority of recent advancements related to the fault diagnosis of
electrical motors are based on the assumption that training and testing data
are drawn from the same distribution. However, the data distribution can vary
across different operating conditions during real-world operating scenarios of
electrical motors. Consequently, this assumption limits the practical
implementation of existing studies for fault diagnosis, as they rely on fully
labelled training data spanning all operating conditions and assume a
consistent distribution. This is because obtaining a large number of labelled
samples for several machines across different fault cases and operating
scenarios may be unfeasible. In order to overcome the aforementioned
limitations, this work proposes a framework to develop a foundational model for
fault diagnosis of electrical motors. It involves building a neural
network-based backbone to learn high-level features using self-supervised
learning, and then fine-tuning the backbone to achieve specific objectives. The
primary advantage of such an approach is that the backbone can be fine-tuned to
achieve a wide variety of target tasks using very less amount of training data
as compared to traditional supervised learning methodologies. The empirical
evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach by obtaining
more than 90\% classification accuracy by fine-tuning the backbone not only
across different types of fault scenarios or operating conditions, but also
across different machines. This illustrates the promising potential of the
proposed approach for cross-machine fault diagnosis tasks in real-world
applications.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding complex
microstructures and their effect on macroscopic properties. In general, it is
difficult to derive an effective constitutive law for such microstructures with
reasonable accuracy and meaningful parameters. One numerical approach to bridge
the scales is computational homogenization, in which a microscopic problem is
solved at every macroscopic point, essentially replacing the effective
constitutive model. Such approaches are, however, computationally expensive and
typically infeasible in multi-query contexts such as optimization and material
design. To render these analyses tractable, surrogate models that can
accurately approximate and accelerate the microscopic problem over a large
design space of shapes, material and loading parameters are required. In
previous works, such models were constructed in a data-driven manner using
methods such as Neural Networks (NN) or Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).
However, these approaches currently suffer from issues, such as need for large
amounts of training data, lack of physics, and considerable extrapolation
errors. In this work, we develop a reduced order model based on Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Empirical Cubature Method (ECM) and a
geometrical transformation method with the following key features: (i) large
shape variations of the microstructure are captured, (ii) only relatively small
amounts of training data are necessary, and (iii) highly non-linear
history-dependent behaviors are treated. The proposed framework is tested and
examined in two numerical examples, involving two scales and large geometrical
variations. In both cases, high speed-ups and accuracies are achieved while
observing good extrapolation behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Harnessing the power of pre-training on large-scale datasets like ImageNet
forms a fundamental building block for the progress of representation
learning-driven solutions in computer vision. Medical images are inherently
different from natural images as they are acquired in the form of many
modalities (CT, MR, PET, Ultrasound etc.) and contain granulated information
like tissue, lesion, organs etc. These characteristics of medical images
require special attention towards learning features representative of local
context. In this work, we focus on designing an effective pre-training
framework for 3D radiology images. First, we propose a new masking strategy
called local masking where the masking is performed across channel embeddings
instead of tokens to improve the learning of local feature representations. We
combine this with classical low-level perturbations like adding noise and
downsampling to further enable low-level representation learning. To this end,
we introduce Disruptive Autoencoders, a pre-training framework that attempts to
reconstruct the original image from disruptions created by a combination of
local masking and low-level perturbations. Additionally, we also devise a
cross-modal contrastive loss (CMCL) to accommodate the pre-training of multiple
modalities in a single framework. We curate a large-scale dataset to enable
pre-training of 3D medical radiology images (MRI and CT). The proposed
pre-training framework is tested across multiple downstream tasks and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our proposed method tops the public test
leaderboard of BTCV multi-organ segmentation challenge.

appearance of static and dynamic scenes. However, their capabilities lag behind
those offered by representations such as pixels or meshes due to algorithmic

dataset limitation with DiVA-360, a real-world 360 dynamic visual-audio dataset
with synchronized multimodal visual, audio, and textual information about
table-scale scenes. It contains 46 dynamic scenes, 30 static scenes, and 95
static objects spanning 11 categories captured using a new hardware system
using 53 RGB cameras at 120 FPS and 6 microphones for a total of 8.6M image

<p class="mathjax">Optical computing systems can provide high-speed and low-energy data
processing but face deficiencies in computationally demanding training and
simulation-to-reality gap. We propose a model-free solution for lightweight in
situ optimization of optical computing systems based on the score gradient
estimation algorithm. This approach treats the system as a black box and
back-propagates loss directly to the optical weights' probabilistic
distributions, hence circumventing the need for computation-heavy and biased
system simulation. We demonstrate a superior classification accuracy on the
MNIST and FMNIST datasets through experiments on a single-layer diffractive
optical computing system. Furthermore, we show its potential for image-free and
high-speed cell analysis. The inherent simplicity of our proposed method,
combined with its low demand for computational resources, expedites the
transition of optical computing from laboratory demonstrations to real-world
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) based interatomic potentials have transformed the field
of atomistic materials modelling. However, ML potentials depend critically on
the quality and quantity of quantum-mechanical reference data with which they
are trained, and therefore developing datasets and training pipelines is
becoming an increasingly central challenge. Leveraging the idea of "synthetic"
(artificial) data that is common in other areas of ML research, we here show
that synthetic atomistic data, themselves obtained at scale with an existing ML
potential, constitute a useful pre-training task for neural-network interatomic
potential models. Once pre-trained with a large synthetic dataset, these models
can be fine-tuned on a much smaller, quantum-mechanical one, improving
numerical accuracy and stability in computational practice. We demonstrate
feasibility for a series of equivariant graph-neural-network potentials for
carbon, and we carry out initial experiments to test the limits of the
approach.

<p class="mathjax">Natural Language Processing (NLP), a cornerstone field within artificial
intelligence, has been increasingly utilized in the field of materials science
literature. Our study conducts a reproducibility analysis of two pioneering
works within this domain: "Machine-learned and codified synthesis parameters of
oxide materials" by Kim et al., and "Unsupervised word embeddings capture
latent knowledge from materials science literature" by Tshitoyan et al. We aim
to comprehend these studies from a reproducibility perspective, acknowledging
their significant influence on the field of materials informatics, rather than
critiquing them. Our study indicates that both papers offered thorough
workflows, tidy and well-documented codebases, and clear guidance for model
evaluation. This makes it easier to replicate their results successfully and
partially reproduce their findings. In doing so, they set commendable standards
for future materials science publications to aspire to. However, our analysis
also highlights areas for improvement such as to provide access to training
data where copyright restrictions permit, more transparency on model
architecture and the training process, and specifications of software
dependency versions. We also cross-compare the word embedding models between
papers, and find that some key differences in reproducibility and
cross-compatibility are attributable to design choices outside the bounds of
the models themselves. In summary, our study appreciates the benchmark set by
these seminal papers while advocating for further enhancements in research
reproducibility practices in the field of NLP for materials science. This
balance of understanding and continuous improvement will ultimately propel the
intersecting domains of NLP and materials science literature into a future of
exciting discoveries.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the approximation of functions $f$ on a bounded domain
$\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ by the outputs of single-hidden-layer ReLU neural
networks of width $n$. This form of nonlinear $n$-term dictionary approximation
has been intensely studied since it is the simplest case of neural network
approximation (NNA). There are several celebrated approximation results for
this form of NNA that introduce novel model classes of functions on $\Omega$
whose approximation rates avoid the curse of dimensionality. These novel
classes include Barron classes, and classes based on sparsity or variation such
as the Radon-domain BV classes.
<br />The present paper is concerned with the definition of these novel model
classes on domains $\Omega$. The current definition of these model classes does
not depend on the domain $\Omega$. A new and more proper definition of model
classes on domains is given by introducing the concept of weighted variation
spaces. These new model classes are intrinsic to the domain itself. The
importance of these new model classes is that they are strictly larger than the
classical (domain-independent) classes. Yet, it is shown that they maintain the
same NNA rates.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE) is a technique based on leveraging a quantum
computer to estimate a kernel function that is classically difficult to
calculate, which is then used by a classical computer for training a Support
Vector Machine (SVM). Given the high number of 2-local operators necessary for
realizing a feature mapping hard to simulate classically, a high qubit
connectivity is needed, which is not currently possible on superconducting
devices. For this reason, neutral atom quantum computers can be used, since
they allow to arrange the atoms with more freedom. Examples of
neutral-atom-based QKE can be found in the literature, but they are focused on
graph learning and use the analogue approach. In this paper, a general method
based on the gate model is presented. After deriving 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates
starting from laser pulses, a parameterized sequence for feature mapping on 3
qubits is realized. This sequence is then used to empirically compute the
kernel matrix starting from a dataset, which is finally used to train the SVM.
It is also shown that this process can be generalized up to N qubits taking
advantage of the more flexible arrangement of atoms that this technology
allows. The accuracy is shown to be high despite the small dataset and the low
separation. This is the first paper that not only proposes an algorithm for
explicitly deriving a universal set of gates but also presents a method of
estimating quantum kernels on neutral atom devices for general problems using
the gate model.

<p class="mathjax">Item Response Theory (IRT) has been proposed within the field of Educational
Psychometrics to assess student ability as well as test question difficulty and
discrimination power. More recently, IRT has been applied to evaluate machine
learning algorithm performance on a single classification dataset, where the
student is now an algorithm, and the test question is an observation to be
classified by the algorithm. In this paper we present a modified IRT-based
framework for evaluating a portfolio of algorithms across a repository of
datasets, while simultaneously eliciting a richer suite of characteristics -
such as algorithm consistency and anomalousness - that describe important
aspects of algorithm performance. These characteristics arise from a novel
inversion and reinterpretation of the traditional IRT model without requiring
additional dataset feature computations. We test this framework on algorithm
portfolios for a wide range of applications, demonstrating the broad
applicability of this method as an insightful algorithm evaluation tool.
Furthermore, the explainable nature of IRT parameters yield an increased
understanding of algorithm portfolios.

problem, is dimensionally similar. Here we show that by modifying the problem
formulation using dimensionless variables, we can re-use the optimal control
law generated numerically for a specific system to a sub-space of dimensionally
similar systems. This is demonstrated, with numerically generated optimal
controllers, for the classic motion control problem of swinging-up a
torque-limited inverted pendulum. We also discuss the concept of regime, a
region in the space of context variables, that can help relax the condition on
dimensional similarity. Futhermore, we discuss how applying dimensionnal
scaling of the input and output of a context-specific policy is equivalent to
substituing the new systems parameters in an analytical equation for
dimentionnaly similar systems. It remains to be seen if this approach can also
help generalizing policies for more complex high-dimensional problems.

function $f(x,y)$ is $\mu_x$-PL in $x$ and $\mu_y$-PL in $y$; and each

$\kappa_x\triangleq L/\mu_x$ and $\kappa_y\triangleq L/\mu_y$. For the
ill-conditioned case, we provide an accelerated algorithm to reduce the
computational cost further. It achieves $\tilde{{\mathcal
O}}\big((n+\sqrt{n}\,\kappa_x\kappa_y)\log^2 (1/\epsilon)\big)$ SFO upper bound
when $\kappa_y \gtrsim \sqrt{n}$. Our ideas also can be applied to the more
general setting that the objective function only satisfies PL condition for one
variable. Numerical experiments validate the superiority of proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">Over the last decade, convolutional neural networks have emerged and advanced
the state-of-the-art in various image analysis and computer vision
applications. The performance of 2D image classification networks is constantly
improving and being trained on databases made of millions of natural images.
However, progress in medical image analysis has been hindered by limited
annotated data and acquisition constraints. These limitations are even more
pronounced given the volumetry of medical imaging data. In this paper, we
introduce an efficient way to transfer the efficiency of a 2D classification
network trained on natural images to 2D, 3D uni- and multi-modal medical image
segmentation applications. In this direction, we designed novel architectures
based on two key principles: weight transfer by embedding a 2D pre-trained
encoder into a higher dimensional U-Net, and dimensional transfer by expanding
a 2D segmentation network into a higher dimension one. The proposed networks
were tested on benchmarks comprising different modalities: MR, CT, and
ultrasound images. Our 2D network ranked first on the CAMUS challenge dedicated
to echo-cardiographic data segmentation and surpassed the state-of-the-art.
Regarding 2D/3D MR and CT abdominal images from the CHAOS challenge, our
approach largely outperformed the other 2D-based methods described in the
challenge paper on Dice, RAVD, ASSD, and MSSD scores and ranked third on the
online evaluation platform. Our 3D network applied to the BraTS 2022
competition also achieved promising results, reaching an average Dice score of
91.69% (91.22%) for the whole tumor, 83.23% (84.77%) for the tumor core, and
81.75% (83.88%) for enhanced tumor using the approach based on weight
(dimensional) transfer. Experimental and qualitative results illustrate the
effectiveness of our methods for multi-dimensional medical image segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">The current National Airspace System (NAS) is reaching capacity due to
increased air traffic, and is based on outdated pre-tactical planning. This
study proposes a more dynamic airspace configuration (DAC) approach that could
increase throughput and accommodate fluctuating traffic, ideal for emergencies.
The proposed approach constructs the airspace as a constraints-embedded graph,
compresses its dimensions, and applies a spectral clustering-enabled adaptive
algorithm to generate collaborative airport groups and evenly distribute
workloads among them. Under various traffic conditions, our experiments
demonstrate a 50\% reduction in workload imbalances. This research could
ultimately form the basis for a recommendation system for optimized airspace

<p class="mathjax">We adopt a policy optimization viewpoint towards policy evaluation for robust
Markov decision process with $\mathrm{s}$-rectangular ambiguity sets. The
developed method, named first-order policy evaluation (FRPE), provides the
first unified framework for robust policy evaluation in both deterministic
(offline) and stochastic (online) settings, with either tabular representation
or generic function approximation. In particular, we establish linear
convergence in the deterministic setting, and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity in the stochastic
setting. FRPE also extends naturally to evaluating the robust state-action
value function with $(\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{a})$-rectangular ambiguity sets. We
discuss the application of the developed results for stochastic policy
optimization of large-scale robust MDPs.

<p class="mathjax">This work explores entanglement-assisted communication, where quantum
entanglement resources enable the transmission of classical information at an
enhanced rate. We consider a scenario where entanglement is distributed ahead
of time based on network traffic levels, and simulate a setting where idle
nodes generate and store entanglement to later transmit messages at an
accelerated rate. We analyze this communication model using noise models for
quantum memory in various scenarios, and extend our investigation to a
quantum-enhanced distributed computing environment, where entanglement storage
enhances data transmission rates for cooperative data processing. We propose a
protocol and demonstrate a distributed version of unsupervised clustering. Our
results show that, for qubit channels, high rates of entanglement generation
and modest storage requirements can surpass the classical limit with
entanglement assistance.

<p class="mathjax">This paper reports the findings of an experimental study on the problem of
line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) classification in an indoor
environment. Specifically, we deploy a pair of NI 2901 USRP software-defined
radios (SDR) in a large hall. The transmit SDR emits an unmodulated tone of
frequency 10 KHz, on a center frequency of 2.4 GHz, using three different
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The receive SDR constructs a dataset of pathloss
measurements from the received signal as it moves across 15 equi-spaced
positions on a 1D grid (for both LOS and NLOS scenarios). We utilize our custom
dataset to estimate the pathloss parameters (i.e., pathloss exponent) using the
least-squares method, and later, utilize the parameterized pathloss model to
construct a binary hypothesis test for NLOS identification. Further, noting
that the pathloss measurements slightly deviate from Gaussian distribution, we
feed our custom dataset to four machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., linear
support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function SVM (RBF-SVM), linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and
logistic regression (LR). It turns out that the performance of the ML
algorithms is only slightly superior to the Neyman-Pearson-based binary
hypothesis test (BHT). That is, the RBF-SVM classifier (the best performing ML
classifier) and the BHT achieve a maximum accuracy of 88.24% and 87.46% for low
SNR, 83.91% and 81.21% for medium SNR, and 87.38% and 86.65% for high SNR.

<p class="mathjax">A locked $t$-omino tiling is a tiling of a finite grid or torus by
$t$-ominoes such that, if you remove any pair of tiles, the only way to fill in
the remaining space with $t$-ominoes is to use the same two tiles in the exact
same configuration as before. We exclude degenerate cases where there is only
one tiling due to the grid/torus dimensions. Locked $t$-omino tilings arise as
obstructions to popular political redistricting algorithms. It is a classic
(and straightforward) result that grids do not admit locked 2-omino tilings. In
this paper, we construct explicit locked 3-, 4-, and 5-omino tilings of grids
of various sizes. While 3-omino tilings are plentiful, we find that 4- and
5-omino tilings are remarkably elusive. Using an exhaustive computational
search, we find that, up to symmetries, the $10 \times 10$ grid admits a locked
4-omino tiling, the $20 \times 20$ grid admits a locked 5-omino tiling, and
there are no others for any other grid size attempted. Finally, we construct an
infinite family of locked $t$-omino tilings on tori with unbounded $t$.

<p class="mathjax">In this work we introduce the lag irreversibility function as a method to
assess time-irreversibility in discrete time series. It quantifies the degree
of time-asymmetry for the joint probability function of the state variable
under study and the state variable lagged in time. We test its performance in a
time-irreversible Markov chain model for which theoretical results are known.
Moreover, we use our approach to analyze electrocardiographic recordings of
four groups of subjects: healthy young individuals, healthy elderly
individuals, and persons with two different disease conditions, namely,
congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation. We find that by studying
jointly the variability of the amplitudes of the different waves in the
electrocardiographic signals, one can obtain an efficient method to
discriminate between the groups already mentioned. Finally, we test the
accuracy of our method using the ROC analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Anatomical segmentation of organs in ultrasound images is essential to many
clinical applications, particularly for diagnosis and monitoring. Existing deep
neural networks require a large amount of labeled data for training in order to
achieve clinically acceptable performance. Yet, in ultrasound, due to
characteristic properties such as speckle and clutter, it is challenging to
obtain accurate segmentation boundaries, and precise pixel-wise labeling of
images is highly dependent on the expertise of physicians. In contrast, CT
scans have higher resolution and improved contrast, easing organ
identification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning to
optimize task-based ultra-sound image representations. Given annotated CT
segmentation maps as a simulation medium, we model acoustic propagation through
tissue via ray-casting to generate ultrasound training data. Our ultrasound
simulator is fully differentiable and learns to optimize the parameters for
generating physics-based ultrasound images guided by the downstream
segmentation task. In addition, we train an image adaptation network between
real and simulated images to achieve simultaneous image synthesis and automatic
segmentation on US images in an end-to-end training setting. The proposed
method is evaluated on aorta and vessel segmentation tasks and shows promising
quantitative results. Furthermore, we also conduct qualitative results of
optimized image representations on other organs.

<p class="mathjax">Lung disease is a common health problem in many parts of the world. It is a
significant risk to people health and quality of life all across the globe
since it is responsible for five of the top thirty leading causes of death.
Among them are COVID 19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, to name just a few. It is
critical to diagnose lung diseases in their early stages. Several different
models including machine learning and image processing have been developed for
this purpose. The earlier a condition is diagnosed, the better the patient
chances of making a full recovery and surviving into the long term. Thanks to
deep learning algorithms, there is significant promise for the autonomous,
rapid, and accurate identification of lung diseases based on medical imaging.
Several different deep learning strategies, including convolutional neural
networks (CNN), vanilla neural networks, visual geometry group based networks
(VGG), and capsule networks , are used for the goal of making lung disease
forecasts. The standard CNN has a poor performance when dealing with rotated,
tilted, or other aberrant picture orientations. As a result of this, within the
scope of this study, we have suggested a vision transformer based approach end
to end framework for the diagnosis of lung disorders. In the architecture, data
augmentation, training of the suggested models, and evaluation of the models
are all included. For the purpose of detecting lung diseases such as pneumonia,
Covid 19, lung opacity, and others, a specialised Compact Convolution
Transformers (CCT) model have been tested and evaluated on datasets such as the
Covid 19 Radiography Database. The model has achieved a better accuracy for
both its training and validation purposes on the Covid 19 Radiography Database.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of a Fibonacci
quasicrystalline stacking of ferromagnetic layers, potentially realizable using
van der Waals magnetic materials. We construct a model of this magnetic
heterostructure, which includes up to second neighbor interlayer magnetic
interactions, that displays a complex relationship between geometric
frustration and magnetic order in this quasicrystalline system. To navigate the
parameter space and identify distinct magnetic phases, we employ a machine
learning approach, which proves to be a powerful tool in revealing the complex
magnetic behavior of this system. We offer a thorough description of the
magnetic phase diagram as a function of the model parameters. Notably, we
discover among other collinear and non-collinear phases, a unique ferromagnetic
alternating helical phase. In this non-collinear quasiperiodic ferromagnetic
configuration the magnetization decreases logarithmically with the stack
height.

<p class="mathjax">Flood inundation forecast provides critical information for emergency
planning before and during flood events. Real time flood inundation forecast
tools are still lacking. High-resolution hydrodynamic modeling has become more
accessible in recent years, however, predicting flood extents at the street and
building levels in real-time is still computationally demanding. Here we
present a hybrid process-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approach
for flood extent and inundation depth prediction. We used the Fourier neural
operator (FNO), a highly efficient ML method, for surrogate modeling. The FNO
model is demonstrated over an urban area in Houston (Texas, U.S.) by training
using simulated water depths (in 15-min intervals) from six historical storm
events and then tested over two holdout events. Results show FNO outperforms
the baseline U-Net model. It maintains high predictability at all lead times
tested (up to 3 hrs) and performs well when applying to new sites, suggesting
strong generalization skill.

<p class="mathjax">The millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensing-aided communications in vehicular
mobile communication systems is investigated. To alleviate the beam training
overhead under high mobility scenarios, a successive pose estimation and beam
tracking (SPEBT) scheme is proposed to facilitate mmWave communications with
the assistance of mmWave radar sensing. The proposed SPEBT scheme first resorts
to a Fast Conservative Filtering for Efficient and Accurate Radar odometry
(Fast-CFEAR) approach to estimate the vehicle pose consisting of 2-dimensional
position and yaw from radar point clouds collected by mmWave radar sensor.
Then, the pose estimation information is fed into an extend Kalman filter to
perform beam tracking for the line-of-sight channel. Owing to the intrinsic
robustness of mmWave radar sensing, the proposed SPEBT scheme is capable of
operating reliably under extreme weather/illumination conditions and
large-scale global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-denied environments. The
practical deployment of the SPEBT scheme is verified through rigorous testing
on a real-world sensing dataset. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed SPEBT scheme is capable of providing precise pose estimation
information and accurate beam tracking output, while reducing the proportion of
beam training overhead to less than 5% averagely.

<p class="mathjax">An important challenge in the online convex optimization (OCO) setting is to
incorporate generalized inequalities and time-varying constraints. The
inclusion of constraints in OCO widens the applicability of such algorithms to
dynamic but safety-critical settings such as the online optimal power flow
(OPF) problem. In this work, we propose the first projection-free OCO algorithm
admitting time-varying linear constraints and convex generalized inequalities:
the online interior-point method for time-varying equality constraints
($\texttt{OIPM-TEC}$). We derive simultaneous sublinear dynamic regret and
constraint violation bounds for $\texttt{OIPM-TEC}$ under standard assumptions.
For applications where a given tolerance around optima is accepted, we propose
a new OCO performance metric -- the epsilon-regret -- and a more
computationally efficient algorithm, the epsilon $\texttt{OIPM-TEC}$, that
possesses sublinear bounds under this metric. Finally, we showcase the
performance of these two algorithms on an online OPF problem and compare them
to another OCO algorithm from the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Implicit neural representations (INRs) have gained prominence as a powerful
paradigm in scene reconstruction and computer graphics, demonstrating
remarkable results. By utilizing neural networks to parameterize data through
implicit continuous functions, INRs offer several benefits. Recognizing the
potential of INRs beyond these domains, this survey aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of INR models in the field of medical imaging. In
medical settings, numerous challenging and ill-posed problems exist, making
INRs an attractive solution. The survey explores the application of INRs in
various medical imaging tasks, such as image reconstruction, segmentation,
registration, novel view synthesis, and compression. It discusses the
advantages and limitations of INRs, highlighting their resolution-agnostic
nature, memory efficiency, ability to avoid locality biases, and
differentiability, enabling adaptation to different tasks. Furthermore, the
survey addresses the challenges and considerations specific to medical imaging
data, such as data availability, computational complexity, and dynamic clinical
scene analysis. It also identifies future research directions and
opportunities, including integration with multi-modal imaging, real-time and
interactive systems, and domain adaptation for clinical decision support. To
facilitate further exploration and implementation of INRs in medical image
analysis, we have provided a compilation of cited studies along with their
available open-source implementations on
\href{https://github.com/mindflow-institue/Awesome-Implicit-Neural-Representations-in-Medical-imaging}.
Finally, we aim to consistently incorporate the most recent and relevant papers
regularly.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image synthesis is a challenging task due to the scarcity of paired
data. Several methods have applied CycleGAN to leverage unpaired data, but they
often generate inaccurate mappings that shift the anatomy. This problem is
further exacerbated when the images from the source and target modalities are
heavily misaligned. Recently, current methods have aimed to address this issue
by incorporating a supplementary segmentation network. Unfortunately, this
strategy requires costly and time-consuming pixel-level annotations. To
overcome this problem, this paper proposes MaskGAN, a novel and cost-effective
framework that enforces structural consistency by utilizing automatically
extracted coarse masks. Our approach employs a mask generator to outline
anatomical structures and a content generator to synthesize CT contents that
align with these structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskGAN
outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis methods on a challenging pediatric
dataset, where MR and CT scans are heavily misaligned due to rapid growth in
children. Specifically, MaskGAN excels in preserving anatomical structures
without the need for expert annotations. The code for this paper can be found

<p class="mathjax">We present a whole-body model of human metabolism that utilizes a system of
organs and blood vessels to simulate the enzymatic reactions. The model focuses
on key organs, including the brain, heart and lungs, liver, gut, and kidney, as
well as muscle and adipose tissue. The model equations are formulated using
stoichiometry and Michaelis-Menten kinetics to describe the enzymatic
reactions. We demonstrate how the model can be used to simulate the effects of
prolonged fasting and intermittent fasting on selected metabolite
concentrations and glucose flux. Furthermore, by simulating intermittent
fasting the effect on the carbohydrate, the protein and the lipid storage is
examined. We propose this method as a simple and intuitive approach for
modeling the human metabolism, which is general, systematic and easy to
incorporate. This could have potential applications in PK/PD drug development
and in understanding metabolic disorders.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of blind super-resolution (SR) in computer vision is to improve the
resolution of an image without prior knowledge of the degradation process that
caused the image to be low-resolution. The State of the Art (SOTA) model
Real-ESRGAN has advanced perceptual loss and produced visually compelling
outcomes using more complex degradation models to simulate real-world
degradations. However, there is still room to improve the super-resolved
quality of Real-ESRGAN by implementing recent techniques. This research paper
introduces StarSRGAN, a novel GAN model designed for blind super-resolution
tasks that utilize 5 various architectures. Our model provides new SOTA
performance with roughly 10% better on the MANIQA and AHIQ measures, as
demonstrated by experimental comparisons with Real-ESRGAN. In addition, as a
compact version, StarSRGAN Lite provides approximately 7.5 times faster
reconstruction speed (real-time upsampling from 540p to 4K) but can still keep
nearly 90% of image quality, thereby facilitating the development of a
real-time SR experience for future research. Our codes are released at

<p class="mathjax">The biological roles of gene sets are used to group them into collections.
These collections are often characterized by being high-dimensional,
overlapping, and redundant families of sets, thus precluding a straightforward
interpretation and study of their content. Bioinformatics looked for solutions
to reduce their dimension or increase their intepretability. One possibility
lies in aggregating overlapping gene sets to create larger pathways, but the
modified biological pathways are hardly biologically justifiable. We propose to
use importance scores to rank the pathways in the collections studying the
context from a set covering perspective. The proposed Shapley values-based
scores consider the distribution of the singletons and the size of the sets in
the families; Furthermore, a trick allows us to circumvent the usual
exponential complexity of Shapley values' computation. Finally, we address the
challenge of including a redundancy awareness in the obtained rankings where,
in our case, sets are redundant if they show prominent intersections.
<br />The rankings can be used to reduce the dimension of collections of gene sets,
such that they show lower redundancy and still a high coverage of the genes. We
further investigate the impact of our selection on Gene Sets Enrichment
Analysis. The proposed method shows a practical utility in bioinformatics to
increase the interpretability of the collections of gene sets and a step
forward to include redundancy into Shapley values computations.

<p class="mathjax">Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) is a powerful tool to generate
data-driven surrogate models for the prediction and control of nonlinear
dynamical systems in the Koopman framework. In eDMD a compression of the lifted
system dynamics on the space spanned by finitely many observables is computed,
in which the original space is embedded as a low-dimensional manifold. While
this manifold is invariant for the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator, this
invariance is typically not preserved for its eDMD-based approximation. Hence,
an additional (re-)projection step is often tacitly incorporated to improve the
prediction capability. We propose a novel framework for consistent reprojectors
respecting the underlying manifold structure. Further, we present a new
geometric reprojector based on maximum-likelihood arguments, which
significantly enhances the approximation accuracy and preserves known

<p class="mathjax">Bias field, which is caused by imperfect MR devices or imaged objects,
introduces intensity inhomogeneity into MR images and degrades the performance
of MR image analysis methods. Many retrospective algorithms were developed to
facilitate the bias correction, to which the deep learning-based methods
outperformed. However, in the training phase, the supervised deep
learning-based methods heavily rely on the synthesized bias field. As the
formation of the bias field is extremely complex, it is difficult to mimic the
true physical property of MR images by synthesized data. While bias field
correction and image segmentation are strongly related, the segmentation map is
precisely obtained by decoupling the bias field from the original MR image, and
the bias value is indicated by the segmentation map in reverse. Thus, we
proposed novel unsupervised decomposition networks that are trained only with
biased data to obtain the bias-free MR images. Networks are made up of: a
segmentation part to predict the probability of every pixel belonging to each
class, and an estimation part to calculate the bias field, which are optimized
alternately. Furthermore, loss functions based on the combination of fuzzy
clustering and the multiplicative bias field are also devised. The proposed
loss functions introduce the smoothness of bias field and construct the soft
relationships among different classes under intra-consistency constraints.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately
estimate bias fields and produce better bias correction results. The code is
available on the link:

<p class="mathjax">Automatic analysis of colonoscopy images has been an active field of research
motivated by the importance of early detection of precancerous polyps. However,
detecting polyps during the live examination can be challenging due to various
factors such as variation of skills and experience among the endoscopists, lack
of attentiveness, and fatigue leading to a high polyp miss-rate. Deep learning
has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge as it can assist
endoscopists in detecting and classifying overlooked polyps and abnormalities
in real time. In addition to the algorithm's accuracy, transparency and
interpretability are crucial to explaining the whys and hows of the algorithm's
prediction. Further, most algorithms are developed in private data, closed
source, or proprietary software, and methods lack reproducibility. Therefore,
to promote the development of efficient and transparent methods, we have
organized the "Medico automatic polyp segmentation (Medico 2020)" and "MedAI:
Transparency in Medical Image Segmentation (MedAI 2021)" competitions. We
present a comprehensive summary and analyze each contribution, highlight the
strength of the best-performing methods, and discuss the possibility of
clinical translations of such methods into the clinic. For the transparency
task, a multi-disciplinary team, including expert gastroenterologists, accessed
each submission and evaluated the team based on open-source practices, failure
case analysis, ablation studies, usability and understandability of evaluations
to gain a deeper understanding of the models' credibility for clinical
deployment. Through the comprehensive analysis of the challenge, we not only
highlight the advancements in polyp and surgical instrument segmentation but
also encourage qualitative evaluation for building more transparent and
understandable AI-based colonoscopy systems.

<p class="mathjax">An open-locating-dominating set of a graph models a detection system for a
facility with a possible "intruder" or a multiprocessor network with a possible
malfunctioning processor. A "sensor" or "detector" is assumed to be installed
at a subset of vertices where it can detect an intruder or a malfunctioning
processor in their neighborhood, but not at itself. We consider a
fault-tolerant variant of an open-locating-dominating set called an
error-correcting open-locating-dominating set, which can correct a
false-positive or a false-negative signal from a detector. In particular, we
prove the problem of finding a minimum error-correcting
open-locating-dominating set in an arbitrary graph is NP-complete.
Additionally, we characterize the existence criteria for an error-correcting
open-locating-dominating sets for an arbitrary graph. We also consider extremal
graphs that require every vertex to be a detector and minimum error-correcting
open-locating-dominating sets in infinite grids.

<p class="mathjax">Data augmentation is classically used to improve the overall performance of
deep learning models. It is, however, challenging in the case of medical
applications, and in particular for multiparametric datasets. For example,
traditional geometric transformations used in several applications to generate
synthetic images can modify in a non-realistic manner the patients' anatomy.
Therefore, dedicated image generation techniques are necessary in the medical
field to, for example, mimic a given pathology realistically. This paper
introduces a new data augmentation architecture that generates synthetic
multiparametric (T1 arterial, T1 portal, and T2) magnetic resonance images
(MRI) of massive macrotrabecular subtype hepatocellular carcinoma with their
corresponding tumor masks through a generative deep learning approach. The
proposed architecture creates liver tumor masks and abdominal edges used as
input in a Pix2Pix network for synthetic data creation. The method's efficiency
is demonstrated by training it on a limited multiparametric dataset of MRI
triplets from $89$ patients with liver lesions to generate $1,000$ synthetic
triplets and their corresponding liver tumor masks. The resulting Frechet
Inception Distance score was $86.55$. The proposed approach was among the
winners of the 2021 data augmentation challenge organized by the French Society
of Radiology.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate practical algorithms to find or disprove the existence of
small subsets of a dataset which, when removed, reverse the sign of a
coefficient in an ordinary least squares regression involving that dataset. We
empirically study the performance of well-established algorithmic techniques
for this task -- mixed integer quadratically constrained optimization for
general linear regression problems and exact greedy methods for special cases.
We show that these methods largely outperform the state of the art and provide
a useful robustness check for regression problems in a few dimensions. However,
significant computational bottlenecks remain, especially for the important task
of disproving the existence of such small sets of influential samples for
regression problems of dimension $3$ or greater. We make some headway on this
challenge via a spectral algorithm using ideas drawn from recent innovations in
algorithmic robust statistics. We summarize the limitations of known techniques
in several challenge datasets to encourage further algorithmic innovation.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of neural network-based machine learning ushered in high-level
libraries, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, to support their functionality.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) researchers have benefited from this trend
and produced powerful neural networks that promise shorter simulation times.
For example, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
recurrent-based (RNN) architectures can represent sub-grid physical effects,
like turbulence. Implementing neural networks in CFD solvers is challenging
because the programming languages used for machine learning and CFD are mostly
non-overlapping, We present the roseNNa library, which bridges the gap between
neural network inference and CFD. RoseNNa is a non-invasive, lightweight (1000
lines), and performant tool for neural network inference, with focus on the
smaller networks used to augment PDE solvers, like those of CFD, which are
typically written in C/C++ or Fortran. RoseNNa accomplishes this by
automatically converting trained models from typical neural network training
packages into a high-performance Fortran library with C and Fortran APIs. This
reduces the effort needed to access trained neural networks and maintains
performance in the PDE solvers that CFD researchers build and rely upon.
Results show that RoseNNa reliably outperforms PyTorch (Python) and libtorch
(C++) on MLPs and LSTM RNNs with less than 100 hidden layers and 100 neurons
per layer, even after removing the overhead cost of API calls. Speedups range
from a factor of about 10 and 2 faster than these established libraries for the
smaller and larger ends of the neural network size ranges tested.

<p class="mathjax">Sustainable development is an imperative worldwide but metrics and data on
poverty and quality of life have remained too coarse and abstract to
characterize challenges adequately and guide practical progress. Nowhere is
this challenge greater than in Africa where we still know relatively little
about the systematic spatial details and scope of development. Here, we
leverage a complete, high-precision dataset of building footprints to identify
infrastructure deficits and infer informal settlements down to the street level
everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We identify a general pattern of informality
with urbanized areas showing, on average, greater access to infrastructure and
services than rural and periurban areas, each characterized by a statistically
consistent spectrum of uneven local development. We show that our physical
measures of informality are systematically associated with many indicators of
low human development, and that these form a single principal component
predicted by specific functional changes of the built environment. These
results demonstrate that the localization of sustainable development is
possible down to the street level at a continental scale and provide a general
distributed strategy for accelerating progress in infrastructure and service
expansion that taps local innovations in a way that is equitable and context
appropriate.

<p class="mathjax">The searching efficiency of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm is
dependent on both the classical and quantum sides of the algorithm. Recently a
quantum approximate Bayesian optimization algorithm (QABOA) that includes two
mixers was developed, where surrogate-based Bayesian optimization is applied to
improve the sampling efficiency of the classical optimizer. A continuous-time
quantum walk mixer is used to enhance exploration, and the generalized Grover
mixer is also applied to improve exploitation. In this paper, an extension of
the QABOA is proposed to further improve its searching efficiency. The
searching efficiency is enhanced through two aspects. First, two mixers,
including one for exploration and the other for exploitation, are applied in an
alternating fashion. Second, uncertainty of the quantum circuit is quantified
with a new quantum Mat\'ern kernel based on the kurtosis of the basis state
distribution, which increases the chance of obtaining the optimum. The proposed
new two-mixer QABOAs with and without uncertainty quantification are compared
with three single-mixer QABOAs on two discrete and four mixed-integer problems.
The results show that the proposed two-mixer QABOA with uncertainty
quantification has the best performance in efficiency and consistency for five
out of the six problems. The results also show that QABOA with the generalized
Grover mixer performs the best among the single-mixer algorithms, thereby
demonstrating the benefit of exploitation and the importance of dynamic
exploration-exploitation balance in improving searching efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Pathogenic infections pose a significant threat to global health, affecting
millions of people every year and presenting substantial challenges to
healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient and timely testing plays a critical
role in disease control and transmission prevention. Group testing is a
well-established method for reducing the number of tests needed to screen large
populations when the disease prevalence is low. However, it does not fully
utilize the quantitative information provided by qPCR methods, nor is it able
to accommodate a wide range of pathogen loads. To address these issues, we
introduce a novel adaptive semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) scheme to
efficiently screen populations via two-stage qPCR testing. The SQGT method
quantizes cycle threshold ($Ct$) values into multiple bins, leveraging the
information from the first stage of screening to improve the detection
sensitivity. Dynamic $Ct$ threshold adjustments mitigate dilution effects and
enhance test accuracy. Comparisons with traditional binary outcome GT methods
show that SQGT reduces the number of tests by $24$% while maintaining a
negligible false negative rate.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, deep learning models have been applied to neuroimaging data
for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images provide structural
and functional information about the brain, respectively. Combining these
features leads to improved performance than using a single modality alone in
building predictive models for AD diagnosis. However, current multi-modal
approaches in deep learning, based on sMRI and PET, are mostly limited to
convolutional neural networks, which do not facilitate integration of both
image and phenotypic information of subjects. We propose to use graph neural
networks (GNN) that are designed to deal with problems in non-Euclidean
domains. In this study, we demonstrate how brain networks can be created from
sMRI or PET images and be used in a population graph framework that can combine
phenotypic information with imaging features of these brain networks. Then, we
present a multi-modal GNN framework where each modality has its own branch of
GNN and a technique is proposed to combine the multi-modal data at both the
level of node vectors and adjacency matrices. Finally, we perform late fusion
to combine the preliminary decisions made in each branch and produce a final
prediction. As multi-modality data becomes available, multi-source and
multi-modal is the trend of AD diagnosis. We conducted explorative experiments
based on multi-modal imaging data combined with non-imaging phenotypic
information for AD diagnosis and analyzed the impact of phenotypic information
on diagnostic performance. Results from experiments demonstrated that our

<p class="mathjax">Generative modeling is a widely-used machine learning method with various
applications in scientific and industrial fields. Its primary objective is to
simulate new examples drawn from an unknown distribution given training data
while ensuring diversity and avoiding replication of examples from the training
data.
<br />This paper presents theoretical insights into training a generative model
with two properties: (i) the error of replacing the true data-generating
distribution with the trained data-generating distribution should optimally
converge to zero as the sample size approaches infinity, and (ii) the trained
data-generating distribution should be far enough from any distribution
replicating examples in the training data.
<br />We provide non-asymptotic results in the form of finite sample risk bounds
that quantify these properties and depend on relevant parameters such as sample
size, the dimension of the ambient space, and the dimension of the latent
space. Our results are applicable to general integral probability metrics used
to quantify errors in probability distribution spaces, with the Wasserstein-$1$
distance being the central example. We also include numerical examples to
illustrate our theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">Due to limited camera capacities, digital images usually have a narrower
dynamic illumination range than real-world scene radiance. To resolve this
problem, High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction is proposed to recover the
dynamic range to better represent real-world scenes. However, due to different
physical imaging parameters, the tone-mapping functions between images and real
radiance are highly diverse, which makes HDR reconstruction extremely
challenging. Existing solutions can not explicitly clarify a corresponding
relationship between the tone-mapping function and the generated HDR image, but
this relationship is vital when guiding the reconstruction of HDR images. To
address this problem, we propose a method to explicitly estimate the tone
mapping function and its corresponding HDR image in one network. Firstly, based
on the characteristics of the tone mapping function, we construct a model by a
polynomial to describe the trend of the tone curve. To fit this curve, we use a
learnable network to estimate the coefficients of the polynomial. This curve
will be automatically adjusted according to the tone space of the Low Dynamic
Range (LDR) image, and reconstruct the real HDR image. Besides, since all
current datasets do not provide the corresponding relationship between the tone
mapping function and the LDR image, we construct a new dataset with both
synthetic and real images. Extensive experiments show that our method
generalizes well under different tone-mapping functions and achieves SOTA
performance.

<p class="mathjax">This letter presents numerical results with a focus on power transfer between
two antenna arrays placed in the near field, where a much smaller active
multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) center feeds a far larger passive array referred to
as a reflective intelligent surface (RIS). The AMAF is configured along the
principal eigenmode of the AMAF-RIS propagation matrix T. The interest is in
the regime of f/D less than unity. The power transfer coefficient deviates from
the classical distance dependent inverse square law model. This is due to the
natural taper across the RIS aperture at such small f/D ratios. In addition,
the behavior of the power transfer coefficient is more sensitive to the f/D
ratio than to a specific RIS size. We also see that the center feed is more
power efficient than end feed.

learnt causal graphs is crucial for causal inference under interventions. As an
extension to the graph-based structural Hamming distance and structural
intervention distance, we propose a novel continuous-measured metric that
considers the underlying data in addition to the graph structure for its
calculation of the difference between a true and a learnt causal graph. The
distance is based on embedding intervention distributions over each pair of
nodes as conditional mean embeddings into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and
estimating their difference by the maximum (conditional) mean discrepancy. We
show theoretical results which we validate with numerical experiments on

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation is vital to the area of medical imaging because it
enables professionals to more accurately examine and understand the information
offered by different imaging modalities. The technique of splitting a medical
image into various segments or regions of interest is known as medical image
segmentation. The segmented images that are produced can be used for many
different things, including diagnosis, surgery planning, and therapy
evaluation.
<br />In initial phase of research, major focus has been given to review existing
deep-learning approaches, including researches like MultiResUNet, Attention
U-Net, classical U-Net, and other variants. The attention feature vectors or
maps dynamically add important weights to critical information, and most of
these variants use these to increase accuracy, but the network parameter
requirements are somewhat more stringent. They face certain problems such as
overfitting, as their number of trainable parameters is very high, and so is
their inference time.
<br />Therefore, the aim of this research is to reduce the network parameter
requirements using depthwise separable convolutions, while maintaining
performance over some medical image segmentation tasks such as skin lesion
segmentation using attention system and residual connections.

architecture in the context of both tagging (classification) and reconstructing
(regression) Lorentz-boosted top quarks, including the difficult task of
specifically identifying and measuring the $W$-boson inside the dense
environment of the boosted hadronic final state. PELICAN is a novel permutation
equivariant and Lorentz invariant or covariant aggregator network designed to
overcome common limitations found in architectures applied to particle physics
problems. Compared to many approaches that use non-specialized architectures
that neglect underlying physics principles and require very large numbers of
parameters, PELICAN employs a fundamentally symmetry group-based architecture
that demonstrates benefits in terms of reduced complexity, increased
interpretability, and raw performance. When tested on the standard task of
Lorentz-boosted top quark tagging, PELICAN outperforms existing competitors
with much lower model complexity and high sample efficiency. On the less common
and more complex task of four-momentum regression, PELICAN also outperforms
hand-crafted algorithms. We discuss the implications of symmetry-restricted
architectures for the wider field of machine learning for physics.

significant diagnostic challenges due to its reliance on subjective evaluation.
However, recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have demonstrated
the potential for automated assessment. In this paper, we survey recent studies
on AI-based glaucoma diagnosis using fundus, optical coherence tomography, and
visual field images, with a particular emphasis on deep learning-based methods.
We provide an updated taxonomy that organizes methods into architectural
paradigms and includes links to available source code to enhance the
reproducibility of the methods. Through rigorous benchmarking on widely-used
public datasets, we reveal performance gaps in generalizability, uncertainty
estimation, and multimodal integration. Additionally, our survey curates key
datasets while highlighting limitations such as scale, labeling
inconsistencies, and bias. We outline open research challenges and detail
promising directions for future studies. This survey is expected to be useful
for both AI researchers seeking to translate advances into practice and
ophthalmologists aiming to improve clinical workflows and diagnosis using the
latest AI outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of decentralized constrained POMDPs in a team-setting
where the multiple non-strategic agents have asymmetric information. Strong
duality is established for the setting of infinite-horizon expected total
discounted costs when the observations lie in a countable space, the actions
are chosen from a finite space, and the immediate cost functions are bounded.
Following this, connections with the common-information and approximate
information-state approaches are established. The approximate
information-states are characterized independent of the Lagrange-multipliers
vector so that adaptations of the multiplier (during learning) will not
necessitate new representations. Finally, a primal-dual multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on centralized training
distributed execution (CTDE) and three time-scale stochastic approximation is
developed with the aid of recurrent and feedforward neural-networks as

used to capture bisimulation of coalgebras. Lax versions have been used in
those cases where strict lifting fails to capture bisimilarity, as well as in
modeling other notions of simulation. This paper provides tools for defining

<br />As a central result, we define a notion of a lax distributive law of a
functor over the powerset monad, and show that there is an isomorphism between
the lattice of lax liftings and the lattice of lax distributive laws.
<br />We also study two functors in detail: (i) we show that the lifting for
monotone bisimilarity is the minimal lifting for the monotone neighbourhood
functor, and (ii) we show that the lattice of liftings for the (ordinary)
neighbourhood functor is isomorphic to P(4), the powerset of a 4-element set.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: Disease progression of retinal atrophy associated with AMD requires
the accurate quantification of the retinal atrophy changes on longitudinal OCT
studies. It is based on finding, comparing, and delineating subtle atrophy
changes on consecutive pairs (prior and current) of unregistered OCT scans.
Methods: We present a fully automatic end-to-end pipeline for the simultaneous
detection and quantification of time-related atrophy changes associated with
dry AMD in pairs of OCT scans of a patient. It uses a novel simultaneous
multi-channel column-based deep learning model trained on registered pairs of
OCT scans that concurrently detects and segments retinal atrophy segments in
consecutive OCT scans by classifying light scattering patterns in matched pairs
of vertical pixel-wide columns (A-scans) in registered prior and current OCT
slices (B-scans). Results: Experimental results on 4,040 OCT slices with 5.2M
columns from 40 scans pairs of 18 patients (66% training/validation, 33%
testing) with 24.13+-14.0 months apart in which Complete RPE and Outer Retinal
Atrophy (cRORA) was identified in 1,998 OCT slices (735 atrophy lesions from
3,732 segments, 0.45M columns) yield a mean atrophy segments detection
precision, recall of 0.90+-0.09, 0.95+-0.06 and 0.74+-0.18, 0.94+-0.12 for
atrophy lesions with AUC=0.897, all above observer variability. Simultaneous
classification outperforms standalone classification precision and recall by
30+-62% and 27+-0% for atrophy segments and lesions. Conclusions: simultaneous
column-based detection and quantification of retinal atrophy changes associated
with AMD is accurate and outperforms standalone classification methods.
Translational relevance: an automatic and efficient way to detect and quantify
retinal atrophy changes associated with AMD.

<p class="mathjax">Golden-section search and bisection search are the two main principled
algorithms for 1d minimization of quasiconvex (unimodal) functions. The first
one only uses function queries, while the second one also uses gradient
queries. Other algorithms exist under much stronger assumptions, such as
Newton's method. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no principled
exact line search algorithm for general convex functions -- including
piecewise-linear and max-compositions of convex functions -- that takes
advantage of convexity. We propose two such algorithms: $\Delta$-Bisection is a
variant of bisection search that uses (sub)gradient information and convexity
to speed up convergence, while $\Delta$-Secant is a variant of golden-section
search and uses only function queries.
<br />While bisection search reduces the $x$ interval by a factor 2 at every
iteration, $\Delta$-Bisection reduces the (sometimes much) smaller $x^*$-gap
$\Delta^x$ (the $x$ coordinates of $\Delta$) by at least a factor 2 at every
iteration. Similarly, $\Delta$-Secant also reduces the $x^*$-gap by at least a
factor 2 every second function query. Moreover, the $y^*$-gap $\Delta^y$ (the
$y$ coordinates of $\Delta$) also provides a refined stopping criterion, which
can also be used with other algorithms. Experiments on a few convex functions
confirm that our algorithms are always faster than their quasiconvex
counterparts, often by more than a factor 2.
<br />We further design a quasi-exact line search algorithm based on
$\Delta$-Secant. It can be used with gradient descent as a replacement for
backtracking line search, for which some parameters can be finicky to tune --
and we provide examples to this effect, on strongly-convex and smooth
functions. We provide convergence guarantees, and confirm the efficiency of
quasi-exact line search on a few single- and multivariate convex functions.

<p class="mathjax">Matrix factorization is an inference problem that has acquired importance due
to its vast range of applications that go from dictionary learning to
recommendation systems and machine learning with deep networks. The study of
its fundamental statistical limits represents a true challenge, and despite a
decade-long history of efforts in the community, there is still no closed
formula able to describe its optimal performances in the case where the rank of
the matrix scales linearly with its size. In the present paper, we study this
extensive rank problem, extending the alternative 'decimation' procedure that
we recently introduced, and carry out a thorough study of its performance.
Decimation aims at recovering one column/line of the factors at a time, by
mapping the problem into a sequence of neural network models of associative
memory at a tunable temperature. Though being sub-optimal, decimation has the
advantage of being theoretically analyzable. We extend its scope and analysis
to two families of matrices. For a large class of compactly supported priors,
we show that the replica symmetric free entropy of the neural network models
takes a universal form in the low temperature limit. For sparse Ising prior, we
show that the storage capacity of the neural network models diverges as
sparsity in the patterns increases, and we introduce a simple algorithm based
on a ground state search that implements decimation and performs matrix
factorization, with no need of an informative initialization.

observational and interventional studies, to eventually compute counterfactuals
in structural causal models. We start from the case of a single observational
dataset affected by a selection bias. We show that the likelihood of the

expectation-maximisation scheme to approximate the bounds for partially
identifiable counterfactual queries, which are the focus of this paper. We then
show how the same approach can address the general case of multiple datasets,
no matter whether interventional or observational, biased or unbiased, by
remapping it into the former one via graphical transformations. Systematic
numerical experiments and a case study on palliative care show the
effectiveness of our approach, while hinting at the benefits of fusing
heterogeneous data sources to get informative outcomes in case of partial

<p class="mathjax">Speech enhancement in ad-hoc microphone arrays is often hindered by the
asynchronization of the devices composing the microphone array.
Asynchronization comes from sampling time offset and sampling rate offset which
inevitably occur when the microphones are embedded in different hardware
components. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based speech
enhancement solution that is suited for applications in ad-hoc microphone
arrays because it is distributed and copes with asynchronization. We show that
asynchronization has a limited impact on the spatial filtering and mostly
affects the performance of the DNNs. Instead of resynchronising the signals,
which requires costly processing steps, we use an attention mechanism which
makes the DNNs, thus our whole pipeline, robust to asynchronization. We also
show that the attention mechanism leads to the asynchronization parameters in
an unsupervised manner.

<p class="mathjax">Diabetic retinopathy is an ocular condition that affects individuals with
diabetes mellitus. It is a common complication of diabetes that can impact the
eyes and lead to vision loss. One method for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy is
the examination of the fundus of the eye. An ophthalmologist examines the back
part of the eye, including the retina, optic nerve, and the blood vessels that
supply the retina. In the case of diabetic retinopathy, the blood vessels in
the retina deteriorate and can lead to bleeding, swelling, and other changes
that affect vision. We proposed a method for detecting diabetic diabetic
severity levels. First, a set of data-prerpocessing is applied to available
data: adaptive equalisation, color normalisation, Gaussian filter, removal of
the optic disc and blood vessels. Second, we perform image segmentation for
relevant markers and extract features from the fundus images. Third, we apply
an ensemble of classifiers and we assess the trust in the system.

<p class="mathjax">The Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) task aims to convert orthographic input into a
discrete phonetic representation. G2P conversion is beneficial to various
speech processing applications, such as text-to-speech and speech recognition.
However, these tend to rely on manually-annotated pronunciation dictionaries,
which are often time-consuming and costly to acquire. In this paper, we propose
a method to improve the G2P conversion task by learning pronunciation examples
from audio recordings. Our approach bootstraps a G2P with a small set of
annotated examples. The G2P model is used to train a multilingual phone
recognition system, which then decodes speech recordings with a phonetic
representation. Given hypothesized phoneme labels, we learn pronunciation
dictionaries for out-of-vocabulary words, and we use those to re-train the G2P
system. Results indicate that our approach consistently improves the phone
error rate of G2P systems across languages and amount of available data.

<p class="mathjax">Neural text-to-speech systems are often optimized on L1/L2 losses, which make
strong assumptions about the distributions of the target data space. Aiming to
improve those assumptions, Normalizing Flows and Diffusion Probabilistic Models
were recently proposed as alternatives. In this paper, we compare traditional
L1/L2-based approaches to diffusion and flow-based approaches for the tasks of
prosody and mel-spectrogram prediction for text-to-speech synthesis. We use a
prosody model to generate log-f0 and duration features, which are used to
condition an acoustic model that generates mel-spectrograms. Experimental
results demonstrate that the flow-based model achieves the best performance for
spectrogram prediction, improving over equivalent diffusion and L1 models.
Meanwhile, both diffusion and flow-based prosody predictors result in
significant improvements over a typical L2-trained prosody models.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian inference and kernel methods are well established in machine
learning. The neural network Gaussian process in particular provides a concept
to investigate neural networks in the limit of infinitely wide hidden layers by
using kernel and inference methods. Here we build upon this limit and provide a
field-theoretic formalism which covers the generalization properties of
infinitely wide networks. We systematically compute generalization properties
of linear, non-linear, and deep non-linear networks for kernel matrices with
heterogeneous entries. In contrast to currently employed spectral methods we
derive the generalization properties from the statistical properties of the
input, elucidating the interplay of input dimensionality, size of the training
data set, and variability of the data. We show that data variability leads to a
non-Gaussian action reminiscent of a ($\varphi^3+\varphi^4$)-theory. Using our
formalism on a synthetic task and on MNIST we obtain a homogeneous kernel
matrix approximation for the learning curve as well as corrections due to data
variability which allow the estimation of the generalization properties and
exact results for the bounds of the learning curves in the case of infinitely
many training data points.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computers possess the potential to process data using a remarkably
reduced number of qubits compared to conventional bits, as per theoretical
foundations. However, recent experiments have indicated that the practical
feasibility of retrieving an image from its quantum encoded version is
currently limited to very small image sizes. Despite this constraint,
variational quantum machine learning algorithms can still be employed in the
current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. An example is a hybrid
quantum machine learning approach for edge detection. In our study, we present
an application of quantum transfer learning for detecting cracks in gray value
images. We compare the performance and training time of PennyLane's standard
qubits with IBM's qasm\_simulator and real backends, offering insights into
their execution efficiency.

Hansel and of Katona and Szemer\'edi, by showing that the capacity of any
bipartite covering of a graph on $n$ vertices in which the maximum size of an

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the logistic loss (i.e., the cross
entropy loss) have made impressive advancements in various binary
classification tasks. However, generalization analysis for binary
classification with DNNs and logistic loss remains scarce. The unboundedness of
the target function for the logistic loss is the main obstacle to deriving
satisfying generalization bounds. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by
establishing a novel and elegant oracle-type inequality, which enables us to
deal with the boundedness restriction of the target function, and using it to
derive sharp convergence rates for fully connected ReLU DNN classifiers trained
with logistic loss. In particular, we obtain optimal convergence rates (up to
log factors) only requiring the H\"older smoothness of the conditional class
probability $\eta$ of data. Moreover, we consider a compositional assumption
that requires $\eta$ to be the composition of several vector-valued functions
of which each component function is either a maximum value function or a
H\"older smooth function only depending on a small number of its input
variables. Under this assumption, we derive optimal convergence rates (up to
log factors) which are independent of the input dimension of data. This result
explains why DNN classifiers can perform well in practical high-dimensional
classification problems. Besides the novel oracle-type inequality, the sharp
convergence rates given in our paper also owe to a tight error bound for
approximating the natural logarithm function near zero (where it is unbounded)
by ReLU DNNs. In addition, we justify our claims for the optimality of rates by
proving corresponding minimax lower bounds. All these results are new in the
literature and will deepen our theoretical understanding of classification with
DNNs.

<p class="mathjax">We study the shepherding problem where a group of "herders" need to drive the
dynamics of a group of "target" agents. In particular, we relax two strong
assumptions made in the existing literature, namely that the targets' own
dynamics shows cohesive collective behaviour (e.g. flocking) in the absence of
herders and that the herders possess global sensing capability. We find, for
the first time, scaling laws linking the number of targets to be herd to the
minimum number of herders that can solve the problem. Surprisingly we observe
that, when limited sensing is present, the number of herders needed to
successfully achieve the herding task significantly increases as the targets'
density becomes lower than a critical threshold. We explain the existence of
such a threshold in terms of the percolation of a suitably defined herdability
graph. Exhaustive numerical experiments validate and confirm the effectiveness
of our methodology.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm that has shown great promise in
accelerating large-scale scientific, optimization, and machine-learning
workloads. With most quantum computing solutions being offered over the cloud,
it has become imperative to protect confidential and proprietary quantum code
from being accessed by untrusted and/or adversarial agents. In response to this
challenge, we propose SPYCE, which is the first known solution to obfuscate
quantum code and output to prevent the leaking of any confidential information
over the cloud. SPYCE implements a lightweight, scalable, and effective
solution based on the unique principles of quantum computing to achieve this
task.

<p class="mathjax">Hopfield networks are an attractive choice for solving many types of
computational problems because they provide a biologically plausible mechanism.
The Self-Optimization (SO) model adds to the Hopfield network by using a
biologically founded Hebbian learning rule, in combination with repeated
network resets to arbitrary initial states, for optimizing its own behavior
towards some desirable goal state encoded in the network. In order to better
understand that process, we demonstrate first that the SO model can solve
concrete combinatorial problems in SAT form, using two examples of the Liars
problem and the map coloring problem. In addition, we show how under some
conditions critical information might get lost forever with the learned network
producing seemingly optimal solutions that are in fact inappropriate for the
problem it was tasked to solve. What appears to be an undesirable side-effect
of the SO model, can provide insight into its process for solving intractable
problems.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel computational framework for solving alternating
current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problems using graphics processing units
(GPUs). While GPUs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various
computing domains, their application in AC OPF has been limited due to
challenges associated with porting sparse automatic differentiation (AD) and
sparse linear solver routines to GPUs. We aim to address these issues with two
key strategies. First, we utilize a single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD)
abstraction of nonlinear programs (NLP). This approach enables the
specification of model equations while preserving their parallelizable
structure, and in turn, facilitates the implementation of AD routines that can
exploit such structure. Second, we employ a condensed-space interior-point
method (IPM) with an inequality relaxation strategy. This technique involves
relaxing equality constraints to inequalities and condensing the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system into a much smaller positive definite system. This
strategy offers the key advantage of being able to factorize the KKT matrix
without numerical pivoting, which in the past has hampered the parallelization
of the IPM algorithm. By combining these two strategies, we can perform the
majority of operations on GPUs while keeping the data residing in the device
memory only. Comprehensive numerical benchmark results showcase the substantial
computational advantage of our approach. Remarkably, for solving large-scale AC
OPF problems to a moderate accuracy, our implementations -- MadNLP.jl and
ExaModels.jl -- running on NVIDIA GPUs achieve an order of magnitude speedup
compared to state-of-the-art tools running on contemporary CPUs.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set $X$ in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is \emph{antipodal of rank $k$}, if for any $k+1$ elements
$q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}\in X$, there is an affine map from $\mathrm{conv} X$ to the
$k$-dimensional simplex $\Delta_k$ that maps $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}$ onto the
$k+1$ vertices of $\Delta_k$. For $k=1$, it coincides with the well-studied
notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We consider the following
natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal sets: What is the maximum
size of an antipodal set of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$? We present a geometric
characterization of antipodal sets of rank $k$ and adapting the argument of
Danzer and Gr\"unbaum originally developed for the $k=1$ case, we prove an
upper bound which is exponential in the dimension. We point out that this
problem can be connected to a classical question in computer science on finding
perfect hashes, and it provides a lower bound on the maximum size, which is
also exponential in the dimension.
