<p class="mathjax">The developed computational approach is capable of initiating and propagating
cracks inside materials and along material interfaces of general multi-domain
structures under quasi-static conditions. Special attention is paid to
particular situation of a solid with inhomogeneities. Description of the
fracture processes are based on the theory of material damage. It introduces
two independent damage parameters to distinguish between interface and internal
cracks. The parameter responsible for interface cracks is defined in a thin
adhesive layer of the interface and renders relation between stress and strain
quantities in fashion of cohesive zone models.The second parameter is defined
inside material domains and it is founded on the theory of phase-field fracture
guaranteeing the material damage to occur in a thin material strip introducing
a regularised model of internal cracks. Additional property of both interface
and phase-field damage is their capability to distinguish between fracture
modes which is useful if the structures is subjected to combined loading. The
solution methodology is based on a variational approach which allows
implementation of non-linear programming optimisation into standard methods of
finite-element discretisation and time stepping method.Computational
implementation is prepared in MATLAB whose numerical data validate developed
formulation for analysis of problems of fracture in multi-domain elements of
structures.

<p class="mathjax">GPT-4 was released in March 2023 to wide acclaim, marking a very substantial
improvement across the board over GPT-3.5 (OpenAI's previously best model,
which had powered the initial release of ChatGPT). However, despite the
genuinely impressive improvement, there are good reasons to be highly skeptical
of GPT-4's ability to reason. This position paper discusses the nature of
reasoning; criticizes the current formulation of reasoning problems in the NLP
community, as well as the way in which LLM reasoning performance is currently
evaluated; introduces a small collection of 21 diverse reasoning problems; and
performs a detailed qualitative evaluation of GPT-4's performance on those
problems. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that, despite its
occasional flashes of analytical brilliance, GPT-4 at present is utterly
incapable of reasoning.

<p class="mathjax">We explore the use of Physics Informed Neural Networks to analyse nonlinear
Hamiltonian Dynamical Systems with a first integral of motion. In this work, we
propose an architecture which combines existing Hamiltonian Neural Network
structures into Adaptable Symplectic Recurrent Neural Networks which preserve
Hamilton's equations as well as the symplectic structure of phase space while
predicting dynamics for the entire parameter space. This architecture is found
to significantly outperform previously proposed neural networks when predicting
Hamiltonian dynamics especially in potentials which contain multiple
parameters. We demonstrate its robustness using the nonlinear Henon-Heiles
potential under chaotic, quasiperiodic and periodic conditions.
<br />The second problem we tackle is whether we can use the high dimensional
nonlinear capabilities of neural networks to predict the dynamics of a
Hamiltonian system given only partial information of the same. Hence we attempt
to take advantage of Long Short Term Memory networks to implement Takens'
embedding theorem and construct a delay embedding of the system followed by
mapping the topologically invariant attractor to the true form. This
architecture is then layered with Adaptable Symplectic nets to allow for
predictions which preserve the structure of Hamilton's equations. We show that
this method works efficiently for single parameter potentials and provides
accurate predictions even over long periods of time.

<p class="mathjax">The emerging technology of the Autonomous Truck Mounted Attenuator (ATMA), a
leader-follower style vehicle system, utilizes connected and automated vehicle
capabilities to enhance safety during transportation infrastructure maintenance
in work zones. However, the speed difference between ATMA vehicles and general
vehicles creates a moving bottleneck that reduces capacity and increases queue
length, resulting in additional delays. The different routes taken by ATMA
cause diverse patterns of time-varying capacity drops, which may affect the
user equilibrium traffic assignment and lead to different system costs. This
manuscript focuses on optimizing the routing for ATMA vehicles in a network to
minimize the system cost associated with the slow-moving operation.
<br />To achieve this, a queuing-based traffic assignment approach is proposed to
identify the system cost caused by the ATMA system. A queuing-based
time-dependent (QBTD) travel time function, considering capacity drop, is
introduced and applied in the static user equilibrium traffic assignment
problem, with a result of adding dynamic characteristics. Subsequently, we
formulate the queuing-based traffic assignment problem and solve it using a
modified path-based algorithm. The methodology is validated using a small-size
and a large-size network and compared with two benchmark models to analyze the
benefit of capacity drop modeling and QBTD travel time function. Furthermore,
the approach is applied to quantify the impact of different routes on the
traffic system and identify an optimal route for ATMA vehicles performing
maintenance work. Finally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore how the
impact changes with variations in traffic demand and capacity reduction.

<p class="mathjax">This research paper presents AMaizeD: An End to End Pipeline for Automatic
Maize Disease Detection, an automated framework for early detection of diseases
in maize crops using multispectral imagery obtained from drones. A custom
hand-collected dataset focusing specifically on maize crops was meticulously
gathered by expert researchers and agronomists. The dataset encompasses a
diverse range of maize varieties, cultivation practices, and environmental
conditions, capturing various stages of maize growth and disease progression.
By leveraging multispectral imagery, the framework benefits from improved
spectral resolution and increased sensitivity to subtle changes in plant
health. The proposed framework employs a combination of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) as feature extractors and segmentation techniques to identify
both the maize plants and their associated diseases. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in detecting a range of maize
diseases, including powdery mildew, anthracnose, and leaf blight. The framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the custom hand-collected dataset and
contributes to the field of automated disease detection in agriculture,
offering a practical solution for early identification of diseases in maize
crops advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Captioning images is a challenging scene-understanding task that connects
computer vision and natural language processing. While image captioning models
have been successful in producing excellent descriptions, the field has
primarily focused on generating a single sentence for 2D images. This paper
investigates whether integrating depth information with RGB images can enhance
the captioning task and generate better descriptions. For this purpose, we
propose a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework for generating a
multi-sentence description of a 3D scene. The RGB image and its corresponding
depth map are provided as inputs to our framework, which combines them to
produce a better understanding of the input scene. Depth maps could be ground
truth or estimated, which makes our framework widely applicable to any RGB
captioning dataset. We explored different fusion approaches to fuse RGB and
depth images. The experiments are performed on the NYU-v2 dataset and the
Stanford image paragraph captioning dataset. During our work with the NYU-v2
dataset, we found inconsistent labeling that prevents the benefit of using
depth information to enhance the captioning task. The results were even worse
than using RGB images only. As a result, we propose a cleaned version of the
NYU-v2 dataset that is more consistent and informative. Our results on both
datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively benefits from
depth information, whether it is ground truth or estimated, and generates
better captions. Code, pre-trained models, and the cleaned version of the
NYU-v2 dataset will be made publically available.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of extracting accurate correspondences for point cloud
registration. Recent keypoint-free methods have shown great potential through
bypassing the detection of repeatable keypoints which is difficult to do
especially in low-overlap scenarios. They seek correspondences over downsampled
superpoints, which are then propagated to dense points. Superpoints are matched
based on whether their neighboring patches overlap. Such sparse and loose
matching requires contextual features capturing the geometric structure of the
point clouds. We propose Geometric Transformer, or GeoTransformer for short, to
learn geometric feature for robust superpoint matching. It encodes pair-wise
distances and triplet-wise angles, making it invariant to rigid transformation
and robust in low-overlap cases. The simplistic design attains surprisingly
high matching accuracy such that no RANSAC is required in the estimation of
alignment transformation, leading to $100$ times acceleration. Extensive
experiments on rich benchmarks encompassing indoor, outdoor, synthetic,
multiway and non-rigid demonstrate the efficacy of GeoTransformer. Notably, our
method improves the inlier ratio by $18{\sim}31$ percentage points and the
registration recall by over $7$ points on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">With a growing complexity of the intelligent traffic system (ITS), an
integrated control of ITS that is capable of considering plentiful
heterogeneous intelligent agents is desired. However, existing control methods
based on the centralized or the decentralized scheme have not presented their
competencies in considering the optimality and the scalability simultaneously.
To address this issue, we propose an integrated control method based on the
framework of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The proposed method
achieves a global consensus on energy consumption efficiency (ECE), meanwhile
to optimize the local objectives of all involved intelligent agents, through a
consensus and incentive mechanism. Furthermore, an operation algorithm is
proposed regarding the issue of structural rigidity in DAO. Specifically, the
proposed operation approach identifies critical agents to execute the smart
contract in DAO, which ultimately extends the capability of DAO-based control.
In addition, a numerical experiment is designed to examine the performance of
the proposed method. The experiment results indicate that the controlled agents
can achieve a consensus faster on the global objective with improved local
objectives by the proposed method, compare to existing decentralized control
methods. In general, the proposed method shows a great potential in developing
an integrated control system in the ITS

brain-driven saliency mechanisms that prioritize certain elements over others.
In this investigation, we present an intelligent system that combines a
drowsiness detection system for drivers with a scene comprehension pipeline
based on saliency. To achieve this, we have implemented a specialized 3D deep
network for semantic segmentation, which has been pretrained and tailored for
processing the frames captured by an automotive-grade external camera. The
proposed pipeline was hosted on an embedded platform utilizing the STA1295
core, featuring ARM A7 dual-cores, and embeds an hardware accelerator.
Additionally, we employ an innovative biosensor embedded on the car steering
wheel to monitor the driver drowsiness, gathering the PhotoPlethysmoGraphy
(PPG) signal of the driver. A dedicated 1D temporal deep convolutional network
has been devised to classify the collected PPG time-series, enabling us to
assess the driver level of attentiveness. Ultimately, we compare the determined
attention level of the driver with the corresponding saliency-based scene
classification to evaluate the overall safety level. The efficacy of the
proposed pipeline has been validated through extensive experimental results.

<p class="mathjax">Since the advent of Neural Radiance Fields, novel view synthesis has received
tremendous attention. The existing approach for the generalization of radiance
field reconstruction primarily constructs an encoding volume from nearby source
images as additional inputs. However, these approaches cannot efficiently
encode the geometric information of real scenes with various scale
objects/structures. In this work, we propose constructing multi-scale encoding
volumes and providing multi-scale geometry information to NeRF models. To make
the constructed volumes as close as possible to the surfaces of objects in the
scene and the rendered depth more accurate, we propose to perform depth
prediction and radiance field reconstruction simultaneously. The predicted
depth map will be used to supervise the rendered depth, narrow the depth range,
and guide points sampling. Finally, the geometric information contained in
point volume features may be inaccurate due to occlusion, lighting, etc. To
this end, we propose enhancing the point volume feature from depth-guided
neighbor feature fusion. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
our method in both novel view synthesis and dense geometry modeling without
per-scene optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Probabilistic generative models of graphs are important tools that enable
representation and sampling. Many recent works have created probabilistic
models of graphs that are capable of representing not only entity interactions
but also their attributes. However, given a generative model of random
attributed graph(s), the general conditions that establish goodness of fit are
not clear a-priori. In this paper, we define goodness of fit in terms of the
mean square contingency coefficient for random binary networks. For this
statistic, we outline a procedure for assessing the quality of the structure of
a learned attributed graph by ensuring that the discrepancy of the mean square
contingency coefficient (constant, or random) is minimal with high probability.
We apply these criteria to verify the representation capability of a
probabilistic generative model for various popular types of graph models.

models that can analyze patients' drug reviews and accurately classify their
satisfaction levels as positive, neutral, or negative. Such models would reduce
the workload of healthcare professionals and provide greater insight into
patients' quality of life, which is a critical indicator of treatment
effectiveness. To achieve this, we implemented and evaluated several
classification models, including a BERT base model, Bio+Clinical BERT, and a
simpler CNN. Results indicate that the medical domain-specific Bio+Clinical
BERT model significantly outperformed the general domain base BERT model,
achieving macro f1 and recall score improvement of 11%, as shown in Table 2.
Future research could explore how to capitalize on the specific strengths of
each model. Bio+Clinical BERT excels in overall performance, particularly with
medical jargon, while the simpler CNN demonstrates the ability to identify
crucial words and accurately classify sentiment in texts with conflicting
sentiments.

<p class="mathjax">Natural language (NL) is arguably the most prevalent medium for expressing
systems and software requirements. Detecting incompleteness in NL requirements
is a major challenge. One approach to identify incompleteness is to compare
requirements with external sources. Given the rise of large language models
(LLMs), an interesting question arises: Are LLMs useful external sources of
knowledge for detecting potential incompleteness in NL requirements? This
article explores this question by utilizing BERT. Specifically, we employ
BERT's masked language model (MLM) to generate contextualized predictions for
filling masked slots in requirements. To simulate incompleteness, we withhold
content from the requirements and assess BERT's ability to predict terminology
that is present in the withheld content but absent in the disclosed content.
BERT can produce multiple predictions per mask. Our first contribution is
determining the optimal number of predictions per mask, striking a balance
between effectively identifying omissions in requirements and mitigating noise
present in the predictions. Our second contribution involves designing a
machine learning-based filter to post-process BERT's predictions and further
reduce noise. We conduct an empirical evaluation using 40 requirements
specifications from the PURE dataset. Our findings indicate that: (1) BERT's
predictions effectively highlight terminology that is missing from
requirements, (2) BERT outperforms simpler baselines in identifying relevant
yet missing terminology, and (3) our filter significantly reduces noise in the
predictions, enhancing BERT's effectiveness as a tool for completeness checking
of requirements.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a multi-user semantic communications system in which agents
(transmitters and receivers) interact through the exchange of semantic messages
to convey meanings. In this context, languages are instrumental in structuring
the construction and consolidation of knowledge, influencing conceptual
representation and semantic extraction and interpretation. Yet, the crucial
role of languages in semantic communications is often overlooked. When this is
not the case, agent languages are assumed compatible and unambiguously
interoperable, ignoring practical limitations that may arise due to language
mismatching. This is the focus of this work. When agents use distinct
languages, message interpretation is prone to semantic noise resulting from
critical distortion introduced by semantic channels. To address this problem,
this paper proposes a new semantic channel equalizer to counteract and limit
the critical ambiguity in message interpretation. Our proposed solution models
the mismatch of languages with measurable transformations over semantic
representation spaces. We achieve this using optimal transport theory, where we
model such transformations as transportation maps. Then, to recover at the
receiver the meaning intended by the teacher we operate semantic equalization
to compensate for the transformation introduced by the semantic channel, either
before transmission and/or after the reception of semantic messages. We
implement the proposed approach as an operation over a codebook of
transformations specifically designed for successful communication. Numerical
results show that the proposed semantic channel equalizer outperforms
traditional approaches in terms of operational complexity and transmission
accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchain technology is apt to facilitate the automation of multi-party
cooperations among various players in a decentralized setting, especially in
cases where trust among participants is limited. Transactions are stored in a
ledger, a replica of which is retained by every node of the blockchain network.
The operations saved thereby are thus publicly accessible. While this aspect
enhances transparency, reliability, and persistence, it hinders the utilization
of public blockchains for process automation as it violates typical
confidentiality requirements in corporate settings. To overcome this issue, we
propose our approach named Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for
Interoperating Applications (MARTSIA). Based on Multi-Authority Attribute-Based
Encryption (MA-ABE), MARTSIA enables read-access control over shared data at
the level of message parts. User-defined policies determine whether an actor
can interpret the publicly stored information or not, depending on the actor's
attributes declared by a consortium of certifiers. Still, all nodes in the
blockchain network can attest to the publication of the (encrypted) data. We
provide a formal analysis of the security guarantees of MARTSIA, and illustrate
the proof-of-concept implementation over multiple blockchain platforms. To
demonstrate its interoperability, we showcase its usage in ensemble with a
state-of-the-art blockchain-based engine for multi-party process execution, and
three real-world decentralized applications in the context of NFT markets,
supply chain, and retail.

maximum $n$ we can achieve under different conditions such as image resolution,
we estimate the number of regions of high class confidence around a particular

significant problem for exhaustive defense strategies. We show several
immediate consequences of this: adversarial attacks that change the resulting
class based on their intensity, and scale-independent adversarial examples. To
demonstrate the redundancy and richness of class decision boundaries in the

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale Pre-Training Vision-Language Model such as CLIP has demonstrated
outstanding performance in zero-shot classification, e.g. achieving 76.3% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet without seeing any example, which leads to potential
benefits to many tasks that have no labeled data. However, while applying CLIP
to a downstream target domain, the presence of visual and text domain gaps and
cross-modality misalignment can greatly impact the model performance. To
address such challenges, we propose ReCLIP, the first source-free domain
adaptation method for vision-language models, which does not require any source
data or target labeled data. ReCLIP first learns a projection space to mitigate
the misaligned visual-text embeddings and learns pseudo labels, and then
deploys cross-modality self-training with the pseudo labels, to update visual
and text encoders, refine labels and reduce domain gaps and misalignments
iteratively. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate ReCLIP reduces the
average error rate of CLIP from 30.17% to 25.06% on 22 image classification
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">This work studies a challenging yet more realistic setting for zero-shot
cross-task generalization: demonstration-free learning from textual
instructions, presuming the existence of a paragraph-style task definition
while no demonstrations exist. To better learn the task supervision from the
definition, we propose two strategies: first, to automatically find out the
critical sentences in the definition; second, a ranking objective to force the
model to generate the gold outputs with higher probabilities when those
critical parts are highlighted in the definition. The joint efforts of the two
strategies yield state-of-the-art performance on the challenging benchmark. Our
code will be released in the final version of the paper.

<p class="mathjax">In this report, I present a deep learning approach to conduct a natural
language processing (hereafter NLP) binary classification task for analyzing
financial-fraud texts. First, I searched for regulatory announcements and
enforcement bulletins from HKEX news to define fraudulent companies and to
extract their MD&amp;A reports before I organized the sentences from the reports
with labels and reporting time. My methodology involved different kinds of
neural network models, including Multilayer Perceptrons with Embedding layers,
vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the text classification task. By utilizing this
diverse set of models, I aim to perform a comprehensive comparison of their
accuracy in detecting financial fraud. My results bring significant
implications for financial fraud detection as this work contributes to the
growing body of research at the intersection of deep learning, NLP, and
finance, providing valuable insights for industry practitioners, regulators,
and researchers in the pursuit of more robust and effective fraud detection
methodologies.

<p class="mathjax">The two most common data-structures for genome indexing, FM-indices and
hash-tables, exhibit a fundamental trade-off between memory footprint and
performance. We present Ranger, a new indexing technique for nucleotide
sequences that is both memory efficient and fast. We observe that nucleotide
sequences can be represented as integer ranges and leverage a range-matching
algorithm based on neural networks to perform the lookup.
<br />We prototype Ranger in software and integrate it into the popular Minimap2
tool. Ranger achieves almost identical end-to-end performance as the original
Minimap2, while occupying 1.7$\times$ and 1.2$\times$ less memory for short-
and long-reads, respectively. With a limited memory capacity, Ranger achieves
up to 4.3$\times$ speedup for short reads compared to FM-Index, and up to
4.2$\times$ and 1.8$\times$ speedups for short- and long-reads, compared to
hash-tables. Ranger opens up new opportunities in the context of hardware
acceleration by reducing the memory footprint of long-seed indexes used in
state-of-the-art alignment accelerators by up to 23$\times$ which results with
3$\times$ faster alignment and negligible accuracy degradation. Moreover, its
worst case memory bandwidth and latency can be bounded in advance without the
need to inflate DRAM capacity.

<p class="mathjax">Sensor data streams from wearable devices and smart environments are widely
studied in areas like human activity recognition (HAR), person identification,
or health monitoring. However, most of the previous works in activity and
sensor stream analysis have been focusing on one aspect of the data, e.g. only
recognizing the type of the activity or only identifying the person who
performed the activity. We instead propose an approach that uses a weakly
supervised multi-output siamese network that learns to map the data into
multiple representation spaces, where each representation space focuses on one
aspect of the data. The representation vectors of the data samples are
positioned in the space such that the data with the same semantic meaning in
that aspect are closely located to each other. Therefore, as demonstrated with
a set of experiments, the trained model can provide metrics for clustering data
based on multiple aspects, allowing it to address multiple tasks simultaneously
and even to outperform single task supervised methods in many situations. In
addition, further experiments are presented that in more detail analyze the
effect of the architecture and of using multiple tasks within this framework,
that investigate the scalability of the model to include additional tasks, and
that demonstrate the ability of the framework to combine data for which only
partial relationship information with respect to the target tasks is available.

<p class="mathjax">Continual lifelong learning is an machine learning framework inspired by
human learning, where learners are trained to continuously acquire new
knowledge in a sequential manner. However, the non-stationary nature of
streaming training data poses a significant challenge known as catastrophic
forgetting, which refers to the rapid forgetting of previously learned
knowledge when new tasks are introduced. While some approaches, such as
experience replay (ER), have been proposed to mitigate this issue, their
performance remains limited, particularly in the class-incremental scenario
which is considered natural and highly challenging. In this paper, we present a
novel algorithm, called adaptive-experience replay (AdaER), to address the
challenge of continual lifelong learning. AdaER consists of two stages: memory
replay and memory update. In the memory replay stage, AdaER introduces a
contextually-cued memory recall (C-CMR) strategy, which selectively replays
memories that are most conflicting with the current input data in terms of both
data and task. Additionally, AdaER incorporates an entropy-balanced reservoir
sampling (E-BRS) strategy to enhance the performance of the memory buffer by
maximizing information entropy. To evaluate the effectiveness of AdaER, we
conduct experiments on established supervised continual lifelong learning
benchmarks, specifically focusing on class-incremental learning scenarios. The
results demonstrate that AdaER outperforms existing continual lifelong learning
baselines, highlighting its efficacy in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and
improving learning performance.

<p class="mathjax">The universal approximation theorem is generalised to uniform convergence on
the (noncompact) input space $\mathbb R^n$. All continuous functions that
vanish at infinity can be uniformly approximated by neural networks with one
hidden layer, for all continuous activation functions $\varphi\neq0$ with
asymptotically linear behaviour at $\pm\infty$. When $\varphi$ is moreover
bounded, we exactly determine which functions can be uniformly approximated by
neural networks, with the following unexpected results. Let
$\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb R^n)}$ denote the vector space of
functions that are uniformly approximable by neural networks with $l$ hidden
layers and $n$ inputs. For all $n$ and all $l\geq2$,
$\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb R^n)}$ turns out to be an algebra
under the pointwise product. If the left limit of $\varphi$ differs from its
right limit (for instance, when $\varphi$ is sigmoidal) the algebra
$\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb R^n)}$ ($l\geq2$) is independent of
$\varphi$ and $l$, and equals the closed span of products of sigmoids composed
with one-dimensional projections. If the left limit of $\varphi$ equals its
right limit, $\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb R^n)}$ ($l\geq1$) equals
the (real part of the) commutative resolvent algebra, a C*-algebra which is
used in mathematical approaches to quantum theory. In the latter case, the
algebra is independent of $l\geq1$, whereas in the former case
$\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^2(\mathbb R^n)}$ is strictly bigger than
$\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^1(\mathbb R^n)}$.

<p class="mathjax">Introduction. In this exploratory study, we proposed an experimental
framework to investigate and model male/female differences in attitudes towards
online privacy and anonymity among Israeli students. Our aim was to
comparatively model men and women's online privacy attitudes, and to assess the
online privacy gender gap. Method. Various factors related to the user's online
privacy and anonymity were considered, such as awareness of anonymous threats
made online, concern for protecting personal information on the Internet,
online privacy self-efficacy, online privacy literacy and users' tendency to
engage in privacy paradox behaviour, i.e., personal data disclosure despite the
awareness of anonymity and privacy threats. Analysis. A user study was carried
out among 169 Israeli academic students through a quantitative method using
closed-ended questionnaires. The subjects' responses were analysed using
standard statistical measures. We then proposed a summarized comparative model
for the two sexes' online privacy behaviour. Results. We found that a digital
gap still exists between men and women regarding technological knowledge and
skills used to protect their identity and personal information on the Web.
Interestingly, users' tendency to engage in privacy paradox behaviour was not
higher among men despite their higher level of technological online privacy
literacy compared to women. Conclusions. Women's relatively high online privacy
self-efficacy level and their low awareness of technological threat do not
match their relatively low technological online privacy literacy level. This
leads to a lower ability to protect their identity and personal information as
compared to men. We conclude that further steps should be taken to eliminate
the inter-gender technological gap in online privacy and anonymity awareness
and literacy.

<p class="mathjax">Strong-form meshless methods received much attention in recent years and are
being extensively researched and applied to a wide range of problems in science
and engineering. However, the solution of elasto-plastic problems has proven to
be elusive because of often non-smooth constitutive relations between stress
and strain. The novelty in tackling them is the introduction of virtual finite
difference stencils to formulate a hybrid radial basis function generated
finite difference (RBF-FD) method, which is used to solve smallstrain von Mises
elasto-plasticity for the first time by this original approach. The paper
further contrasts the new method to two alternative legacy RBF-FD approaches,
which fail when applied to this class of problems. The three approaches differ
in the discretization of the divergence operator found in the balance equation
that acts on the non-smooth stress field. Additionally, an innovative
stabilization technique is employed to stabilize boundary conditions and is
shown to be essential for any of the approaches to converge successfully.
Approaches are assessed on elastic and elasto-plastic benchmarks where
admissible ranges of newly introduced free parameters are studied regarding
stability, accuracy, and convergence rate.

<p class="mathjax">The occurrence of diffusion on a graph is a prevalent and significant
phenomenon, as evidenced by the spread of rumors, influenza-like viruses, smart
grid failures, and similar events. Comprehending the behaviors of flow is a
formidable task, due to the intricate interplay between the distribution of
seeds that initiate flow propagation, the propagation model, and the topology
of the graph. The study of networks encompasses a diverse range of academic
disciplines, including mathematics, physics, social science, and computer
science. This interdisciplinary nature of network research is characterized by
a high degree of specialization and compartmentalization, and the cooperation
facilitated by them is inadequate. From a machine learning standpoint, there is
a deficiency in a cohesive platform for assessing algorithms across various
domains. One of the primary obstacles to current research in this field is the
absence of a comprehensive curated benchmark suite to study the flow behaviors
under network scenarios.
<br />To address this disparity, we propose the implementation of a novel benchmark
suite that encompasses a variety of tasks, baseline models, graph datasets, and
evaluation tools. In addition, we present a comprehensive analytical framework
that offers a generalized approach to numerous flow-related tasks across
diverse domains, serving as a blueprint and roadmap. Drawing upon the outcomes
of our empirical investigation, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of
current foundational models, and we underscore potential avenues for further
study. The datasets, code, and baseline models have been made available for the

<p class="mathjax">Real world uses of deep learning require predictable model behavior under
distribution shifts. Models such as CLIP show emergent natural distributional
robustness comparable to humans, but may require hundreds of millions of
training samples. Can we train robust learners in a domain where data is
limited? To rigorously address this question, we introduce JANuS (Joint
Annotations and Names Set), a collection of four new training datasets with
images, labels, and corresponding captions, and perform a series of carefully
controlled investigations of factors contributing to robustness in image
classification, then compare those results to findings derived from a
large-scale meta-analysis. Using this approach, we show that standard ResNet-50
trained with the cross-entropy loss on 2.4 million image samples can attain
comparable robustness to a CLIP ResNet-50 trained on 400 million samples. To
our knowledge, this is the first result showing (near) state-of-the-art
distributional robustness on limited data budgets. Our dataset is available at
\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/penfever/JANuS_dataset}, and the code used

<p class="mathjax">The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention
from the general public and LLM vendors. In response, efforts have been made to
align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of
adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously
evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this
paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild,
with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging
natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection
methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their
major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We
also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to
private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To
assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set
comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show
that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in
all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts
which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and
they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the
severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study
can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and
regulated LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Salient Object Detection (SOD) aims to identify and segment the most
conspicuous objects in an image or video. As an important pre-processing step,
it has many potential applications in multimedia and vision tasks. With the
advance of imaging devices, SOD with high-resolution images is of great demand,
recently. However, traditional SOD methods are largely limited to
low-resolution images, making them difficult to adapt to the development of
High-Resolution SOD (HRSOD). Although some HRSOD methods emerge, there are no
large enough datasets for training and evaluating. Besides, current HRSOD
methods generally produce incomplete object regions and irregular object
boundaries. To address above issues, in this work, we first propose a new
HRS10K dataset, which contains 10,500 high-quality annotated images at 2K-8K
resolution. As far as we know, it is the largest dataset for the HRSOD task,
which will significantly help future works in training and evaluating models.
Furthermore, to improve the HRSOD performance, we propose a novel Recurrent
Multi-scale Transformer (RMFormer), which recurrently utilizes shared
Transformers and multi-scale refinement architectures. Thus, high-resolution
saliency maps can be generated with the guidance of lower-resolution
predictions. Extensive experiments on both high-resolution and low-resolution
benchmarks show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most intriguing debates regarding a novel task is the development
of search engines and recommendation-based systems in the music industry.
Studies have shown a drastic depression in the search engine fields, due to
concerning factors such as speed, accuracy and the format of data given for
querying. Often people face difficulty in searching for a song solely based on
the title, hence a solution is proposed to complete a search analysis through a
single query input and is matched with the lyrics of the songs present in the
database. Hence it is essential to incorporate cutting-edge technology tools
for developing a user-friendly search engine. Jina AI is an MLOps framework for
building neural search engines that are utilized, in order for the user to
obtain accurate results. Jina AI effectively helps to maintain and enhance the
quality of performance for the search engine for the query given. An effective
search engine and a recommendation system for the music industry, built with
JinaAI.

<p class="mathjax">Both medical care and observational studies in oncology require a thorough
understanding of a patient's disease progression and treatment history, often
elaborately documented in clinical notes. Despite their vital role, no current
oncology information representation and annotation schema fully encapsulates
the diversity of information recorded within these notes. Although large
language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited impressive performance on
various medical natural language processing tasks, due to the current lack of
comprehensively annotated oncology datasets, an extensive evaluation of LLMs in
extracting and reasoning with the complex rhetoric in oncology notes remains
understudied. We developed a detailed schema for annotating textual oncology
information, encompassing patient characteristics, tumor characteristics,
tests, treatments, and temporality. Using a corpus of 10 de-identified breast
cancer progress notes at University of California, San Francisco, we applied
this schema to assess the abilities of three recently-released LLMs (GPT-4,
GPT-3.5-turbo, and FLAN-UL2) to perform zero-shot extraction of detailed
oncological history from two narrative sections of clinical progress notes. Our
team annotated 2750 entities, 2874 modifiers, and 1623 relationships. The GPT-4
model exhibited overall best performance, with an average BLEU score of 0.69,
an average ROUGE score of 0.72, and an average accuracy of 67% on complex tasks
(expert manual evaluation). Notably, it was proficient in tumor characteristic
and medication extraction, and demonstrated superior performance in inferring
symptoms due to cancer and considerations of future medications. The analysis
demonstrates that GPT-4 is potentially already usable to extract important
facts from cancer progress notes needed for clinical research, complex
population management, and documenting quality patient care.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) are incredibly powerful at comprehending and
generating data in the form of text, but are brittle and error-prone. There has
been an advent of toolkits and recipes centered around so-called prompt
engineering-the process of asking an LLM to do something via a series of
prompts. However, for LLM-powered data processing workflows, in particular,
optimizing for quality, while keeping cost bounded, is a tedious, manual
process. We put forth a vision for declarative prompt engineering. We view LLMs
like crowd workers and leverage ideas from the declarative crowdsourcing
literature-including leveraging multiple prompting strategies, ensuring
internal consistency, and exploring hybrid-LLM-non-LLM approaches-to make
prompt engineering a more principled process. Preliminary case studies on
sorting, entity resolution, and imputation demonstrate the promise of our
approach

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation system is a fundamental functionality of online platforms.
With the development of computing power of mobile phones, some researchers have
deployed recommendation algorithms on users' devices to solve the problems of
data transmission delay and pagination mechanism. However, the existing
edge-side mobile rankings cannot completely solve the problem of pagination
mechanism. The mobile rankings can only sort the items on the current page, so
it will not work if it is called once or twice. Besides, after the user has
viewed the items of interest to the user on the current page, the user refresh
to get a new page of items. This will make the mobile ranking model do a lot of
useless work and affect the user's immersive experience. In order to solve the
pagination mechanism problem, we propose a completely new module in the
pipeline of recommender named Mobile Supply. The pipeline of recommender system
is extended to "retrival-&gt;pre-ranking-&gt;ranking-&gt;re-ranking-&gt;Mobile
Supply-&gt;mobile ranking". Specifically, we introduce the concept of list value
and use point-wise method to approximate list-wise estimation. We also design a
new mobile ranking named device-aware mobile ranking considering the difference
of mobile devices tailored to the new pipeline. Extensive offline and online
experiments show the superiority of our proposed method and prove that Mobile
Supply can further improve the performance of edge-side recommender system and
user experience. Mobile Supply has been deployed on the homepage page of a
large-scale online food platform and has yielded considerable profits in our
business.

<p class="mathjax">Vocabulary learning support tools have widely exploited existing materials,
e.g., stories or video clips, as contexts to help users memorize each target
word. However, these tools could not provide a coherent context for any target
words of learners' interests, and they seldom help practice word usage. In this
paper, we work with teachers and students to iteratively develop Storyfier,
which leverages text generation models to enable learners to read a generated
story that covers any target words, conduct a story cloze test, and use these
words to write a new story with adaptive AI assistance. Our within-subjects
study (N=28) shows that learners generally favor the generated stories for
connecting target words and writing assistance for easing their learning
workload. However, in the read-cloze-write learning sessions, participants
using Storyfier perform worse in recalling and using target words than learning
with a baseline tool without our AI features. We discuss insights into
supporting learning tasks with generative models.

<p class="mathjax">Language Models are being widely used in Education. Even though modern deep
learning models achieve very good performance on question-answering tasks,
sometimes they make errors. To avoid misleading students by showing wrong

<p class="mathjax">Learning-based image deraining methods have made great progress. However, the
lack of large-scale high-quality paired training samples is the main bottleneck
to hamper the real image deraining (RID). To address this dilemma and advance
RID, we construct a Large-scale High-quality Paired real rain benchmark
(LHP-Rain), including 3000 video sequences with 1 million high-resolution
(1920*1080) frame pairs. The advantages of the proposed dataset over the
existing ones are three-fold: rain with higher-diversity and larger-scale,
image with higher-resolution and higher-quality ground-truth. Specifically, the
real rains in LHP-Rain not only contain the classical rain
streak/veiling/occlusion in the sky, but also the \textbf{splashing on the
ground} overlooked by deraining community. Moreover, we propose a novel robust
low-rank tensor recovery model to generate the GT with better separating the
static background from the dynamic rain. In addition, we design a simple
transformer-based single image deraining baseline, which simultaneously utilize
the self-attention and cross-layer attention within the image and rain layer
with discriminative feature representation. Extensive experiments verify the
superiority of the proposed dataset and deraining method over state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">People use mobile devices ubiquitously for computing, communication, storage,
web browsing, and more. As a result, the information accessed and stored within
mobile devices, such as financial and health information, text messages, and
emails, can often be sensitive. Despite this, people frequently use their
mobile devices in public areas, becoming susceptible to a simple yet effective
attack, shoulder surfing. Shoulder surfing occurs when a person near a mobile
user peeks at the user's mobile device, potentially acquiring passcodes, PINs,
browsing behavior, or other personal information. We propose Eye-Shield, a
solution to prevent shoulder surfers from accessing or stealing sensitive
on-screen information. Eye-Shield is designed to protect all types of on-screen
information in real time, without any serious impediment to users' interactions
with their mobile devices. Eye-Shield generates images that appear readable at
close distances, but appear blurry or pixelated at farther distances and wider
angles. It is capable of protecting on-screen information from shoulder
surfers, operating in real time, and being minimally intrusive to the intended
users. Eye-Shield protects images and text from shoulder surfers by reducing
recognition rates to 24.24% and 15.91%. Our implementations of Eye-Shield, with
frame rates of 24 FPS for Android and 43 FPS for iOS, effectively work on
screen resolutions as high as 1440x3088. Eye-Shield also incurs acceptable
memory usage, CPU utilization, and energy overhead. Finally, our MTurk and
in-person user studies indicate that Eye-Shield protects on-screen information
without a large usability cost for privacy-conscious users.

<p class="mathjax">Search query variation poses a challenge in e-commerce search, as equivalent
search intents can be expressed through different queries with surface-level
differences. This paper introduces a framework to recognize and leverage query
equivalence to enhance searcher and business outcomes. The proposed approach
addresses three key problems: mapping queries to vector representations of
search intent, identifying nearest neighbor queries expressing equivalent or
similar intent, and optimizing for user or business objectives. The framework
utilizes both surface similarity and behavioral similarity to determine query
equivalence. Surface similarity involves canonicalizing queries based on word
inflection, word order, compounding, and noise words. Behavioral similarity
leverages historical search behavior to generate vector representations of
query intent. An offline process is used to train a sentence similarity model,
while an online nearest neighbor approach supports processing of unseen
queries. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach, outperforming popular sentence transformer models and achieving a
Pearson correlation of 0.85 for query similarity. The results highlight the
potential of leveraging historical behavior data and training models to
recognize and utilize query equivalence in e-commerce search, leading to
improved user experiences and business outcomes. Further advancements and
benchmark datasets are encouraged to facilitate the development of solutions
for this critical problem in the e-commerce domain.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are a family of high-parameter,
transformer-based neural networks pre-trained on massive datasets of both
natural and programming languages. These models are rapidly being employed in
commercial AI-based developer tools, such as GitHub CoPilot. However, measuring
and explaining their effectiveness on programming tasks is a challenging
proposition, given their size and complexity. The methods for evaluating and
explaining LLMs for code are inextricably linked. That is, in order to explain
a model's predictions, they must be reliably mapped to fine-grained,
understandable concepts. Once this mapping is achieved, new methods for
detailed model evaluations are possible. However, most current explainability
techniques and evaluation benchmarks focus on model robustness or individual
task performance, as opposed to interpreting model predictions.
<br />To this end, this paper introduces ASTxplainer, an explainability method
specific to LLMs for code that enables both new methods for LLM evaluation and
visualizations of LLM predictions that aid end-users in understanding model
predictions. At its core, ASTxplainer provides an automated method for aligning
token predictions with AST nodes, by extracting and aggregating normalized
model logits within AST structures. To demonstrate the practical benefit of
ASTxplainer, we illustrate the insights that our framework can provide by
performing an empirical evaluation on 12 popular LLMs for code using a curated
dataset of the most popular GitHub projects. Additionally, we perform a user
study examining the usefulness of an ASTxplainer-derived visualization of model
predictions aimed at enabling model users to explain predictions. The results
of these studies illustrate the potential for ASTxplainer to provide insights
into LLM effectiveness, and aid end-users in understanding predictions.

<p class="mathjax">We present the Continuous Empirical Cubature Method (CECM), a novel algorithm
for empirically devising efficient integration rules. The CECM aims to improve
existing cubature methods by producing rules that are close to the optimal,
featuring far less points than the number of functions to integrate.
<br />The CECM consists on a two-stage strategy. First, a point selection strategy
is applied for obtaining an initial approximation to the cubature rule,
featuring as many points as functions to integrate. The second stage consists
in a sparsification strategy in which, alongside the indexes and corresponding
weights, the spatial coordinates of the points are also considered as design
variables. The positions of the initially selected points are changed to render
their associated weights to zero, and in this way, the minimum number of points
is achieved.
<br />Although originally conceived within the framework of hyper-reduced order
models (HROMs), we present the method's formulation in terms of generic
vector-valued functions, thereby accentuating its versatility across various
problem domains. To demonstrate the extensive applicability of the method, we
conduct numerical validations using univariate and multivariate Lagrange
polynomials. In these cases, we show the method's capacity to retrieve the
optimal Gaussian rule. We also asses the method for an arbitrary
exponential-sinusoidal function in a 3D domain, and finally consider an example
of the application of the method to the hyperreduction of a multiscale finite
element model, showcasing notable computational performance gains.
<br />A secondary contribution of the current paper is the Sequential Randomized
SVD (SRSVD) approach for computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in a
column-partitioned format. The SRSVD is particularly advantageous when matrix
sizes approach memory limitations.

<p class="mathjax">Online violence against children has increased globally recently, demanding
urgent attention. Competent authorities manually analyze abuse complaints to
comprehend crime dynamics and identify patterns. However, the manual analysis
of these complaints presents a challenge because it exposes analysts to harmful
content during the review process. Given these challenges, we present a novel
solution, an automated tool designed to analyze children's sexual abuse reports
comprehensively. By automating the analysis process, our tool significantly
reduces the risk of exposure to harmful content by categorizing the reports on
three dimensions: Subject, Degree of Criminality, and Damage. Furthermore,
leveraging our multidisciplinary team's expertise, we introduce a novel
approach to annotate the collected data, enabling a more in-depth analysis of
the reports. This approach improves the comprehension of fundamental patterns
and trends, enabling law enforcement agencies and policymakers to create
focused strategies in the fight against children's violence.

<p class="mathjax">Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods strike a balance between
exploration and exploitation by conservative value estimation -- penalizing
values of unseen states and actions. Model-free methods penalize values at all
unseen actions, while model-based methods are able to further exploit unseen
states via model rollouts. However, such methods are handicapped in their
ability to find unseen states far away from the available offline data due to
two factors -- (a) very short rollout horizons in models due to cascading model
errors, and (b) model rollouts originating solely from states observed in
offline data. We relax the second assumption and present a novel unseen state
augmentation strategy to allow exploitation of unseen states where the learned
model and value estimates generalize. Our strategy finds unseen states by
value-informed perturbations of seen states followed by filtering out states
with epistemic uncertainty estimates too high (high error) or too low (too
similar to seen data). We observe improved performance in several offline RL
tasks and find that our augmentation strategy consistently leads to overall
lower average dataset Q-value estimates i.e. more conservative Q-value
estimates than a baseline.

<p class="mathjax">Data management has traditionally relied on synthetic data generators to
generate structured benchmarks, like the TPC suite, where we can control
important parameters like data size and its distribution precisely. These
benchmarks were central to the success and adoption of database management
systems. But more and more, data management problems are of a semantic nature.
An important example is finding tables that can be unioned. While any two
tables with the same cardinality can be unioned, table union search is the
problem of finding tables whose union is semantically coherent. Semantic
problems cannot be benchmarked using synthetic data. Our current methods for
creating benchmarks involve the manual curation and labeling of real data.
These methods are not robust or scalable and perhaps more importantly, it is
not clear how robust the created benchmarks are. We propose to use generative
AI models to create structured data benchmarks for table union search. We
present a novel method for using generative models to create tables with
specified properties. Using this method, we create a new benchmark containing
pairs of tables that are both unionable and non-unionable but related. We
thoroughly evaluate recent existing table union search methods over existing
benchmarks and our new benchmark. We also present and evaluate a new table
search methods based on recent large language models over all benchmarks. We
show that the new benchmark is more challenging for all methods than
hand-curated benchmarks, specifically, the top-performing method achieves a
Mean Average Precision of around 60%, over 30% less than its performance on
existing manually created benchmarks. We examine why this is the case and show
that the new benchmark permits more detailed analysis of methods, including a
study of both false positives and false negatives that were not possible with
existing benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Computer-based simulations of non-invasive cardiac electrical outputs, such
as electrocardiograms and body surface potential maps, usually entail severe
computational costs due to the need of capturing fine-scale processes and to
the complexity of the heart-torso morphology. In this work, we model cardiac
electrical outputs by employing a coupled model consisting of a
reaction-diffusion model - either the bidomain model or the most efficient
pseudo-bidomain model - on the heart, and an elliptic model in the torso. We
then solve the coupled problem with a segregated and staggered in-time
numerical scheme, that allows for independent and infrequent solution in the
torso region. To further reduce the computational load, main novelty of this
work is in introduction of an interpolation method at the interface between the
heart and torso domains, enabling the use of non-conforming meshes, and the
numerical framework application to realistic cardiac and torso geometries. The
reliability and efficiency of the proposed scheme is tested against the
corresponding state-of-the-art bidomain-torso model. Furthermore, we explore
the impact of torso spatial discretization and geometrical non-conformity on
the model solution and the corresponding clinical outputs. The investigation of
the interface interpolation method provides insights into the influence of
torso spatial discretization and of the geometrical non-conformity on the
simulation results and their clinical relevance.

<p class="mathjax">A sparse polynomial (also called a lacunary polynomial) is a polynomial that
has relatively few terms compared to its degree. The sparse-representation of a
polynomial represents the polynomial as a list of its non-zero terms
(coefficient-degree pairs). In particular, the degree of a sparse polynomial
can be exponential in the sparse-representation size.
<br />We prove that for monic polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ such that $g$
divides $f$, the $\ell_2$-norm of the quotient polynomial $f/g$ is bounded by
$\lVert f \rVert_1 \cdot \tilde{O}(\lVert{g}\rVert_0^3\text{deg}^2{
f})^{\lVert{g}\rVert_0 - 1}$. This improves upon the exponential (in
$\text{deg}{ f}$) bounds for general polynomials and implies that the trivial
long division algorithm runs in time quasi-linear in the input size and number
of terms of the quotient polynomial $f/g$, thus solving a long-standing problem
on exact divisibility of sparse polynomials.
<br />We also study the problem of bounding the number of terms of $f/g$ in some
special cases. When $f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $g$ is a cyclotomic-free
(i.e., it has no cyclotomic factors) trinomial, we prove that
$\lVert{f/g}\rVert_0 \leq O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 \text{size}({f})^2 \cdot
\log^6{\text{deg}{ g}})$. When $g$ is a binomial with $g(\pm 1) \neq 0$, we
prove that the sparsity is at most $O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 (
\log{\lVert{f}\rVert_0} + \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_{\infty}}))$. Both upper bounds
are polynomial in the input-size. We leverage these results and give a
polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a cyclotomic-free trinomial
divides a sparse polynomial over the integers.
<br />As our last result, we present a polynomial time algorithm for testing
divisibility by pentanomials over small finite fields when $\text{deg}{ f} =
\tilde{O}(\text{deg}{ g})$.

<p class="mathjax">Interpreting a node-link graph is enhanced if similar subgraphs (or motifs)
are depicted in a similar manner; that is, they have the same visual form.
Small motifs within graphs may be perceived to be identical when they are
structurally dissimilar, or may be perceived to be dissimilar when they are
identical. This issue primarily relates to the Gestalt principle of similarity,
but may also include an element of quick, low-level pattern-matching. We
believe that if motifs are identical, they should be depicted identically; if
they are nearly-identical, they should be depicted nearly-identically. This
principle is particularly important in domains where motifs hold meaning and
where their identification is important. We identified five small motifs:
bi-cliques, cliques, cycles, double-cycles, and stars. For each, we defined
visual variations on two dimensions: same or different structure, same or
different shape. We conducted a crowd-sourced empirical study to test the
perception of similarity of these varied motifs, and found that determining
whether motifs are identical or similar is affected by both shape and
structure.

effects from text by detecting the causal relation. Although this task is
important for language understanding and knowledge discovery, recent works in
this domain have largely focused on binary classification of a text segment as
causal or non-causal. In this regard, we perform a thorough analysis of three
sequence tagging models for causal knowledge extraction and compare it with a
span based approach to causality extraction. Our experiments show that
embeddings from pre-trained language models (e.g. BERT) provide a significant
performance boost on this task compared to previous state-of-the-art models
with complex architectures. We observe that span based models perform better
than simple sequence tagging models based on BERT across all 4 data sets from
diverse domains with different types of cause-effect phrases.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding a student's problem-solving strategy can have a significant
impact on effective math learning using Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and
Adaptive Instructional Systems (AISs). For instance, the ITS/AIS can better
personalize itself to correct specific misconceptions that are indicated by
incorrect strategies, specific problems can be designed to improve strategies
and frustration can be minimized by adapting to a student's natural way of
thinking rather than trying to fit a standard strategy for all. While it may be
possible for human experts to identify strategies manually in classroom
settings with sufficient student interaction, it is not possible to scale this
up to big data. Therefore, we leverage advances in Machine Learning and AI
methods to perform scalable strategy prediction that is also fair to students
at all skill levels. Specifically, we develop an embedding called MVec where we
learn a representation based on the mastery of students. We then cluster these
embeddings with a non-parametric clustering method where we progressively learn
clusters such that we group together instances that have approximately
symmetrical strategies. The strategy prediction model is trained on instances
sampled from these clusters. This ensures that we train the model over diverse
strategies and also that strategies from a particular group do not bias the DNN
model, thus allowing it to optimize its parameters over all groups. Using real
world large-scale student interaction datasets from MATHia, we implement our
approach using transformers and Node2Vec for learning the mastery embeddings
and LSTMs for predicting strategies. We show that our approach can scale up to
achieve high accuracy by training on a small sample of a large dataset and also
has predictive equality, i.e., it can predict strategies equally well for
learners at diverse skill levels.

<p class="mathjax">A vast number of different methods are available for unsupervised
classification. Since no algorithm and parameter setting performs best in all
types of data, there is a need for cluster validation to select the actually
best-performing algorithm. Several indices were proposed for this purpose
without using any additional (external) information. These internal validation
indices can be evaluated by applying them to classifications of datasets with a
known cluster structure. Evaluation approaches differ in how they use the
information on the ground-truth classification. This paper reviews these
approaches, considering their advantages and disadvantages, and then suggests a
new approach.

<p class="mathjax">The cloud-based environments in which today's and future quantum computers
will operate, raise concerns about the security and privacy of user's
intellectual property. Quantum circuits submitted to cloud-based quantum
computer providers represent sensitive or proprietary algorithms developed by
users that need protection. Further, input data is hard-coded into the
circuits, and leakage of the circuits can expose users' data. To help protect
users' circuits and data from possibly malicious quantum computer cloud
providers, this work presented the first hardware architecture for a trusted
execution environment for quantum computers. To protect the user's circuits and
data, the quantum computer control pulses are obfuscated with decoy control
pulses. While digital data can be encrypted, analog control pulses cannot and
this paper proposed the novel decoy pulse approach to obfuscate the analog
control pulses. The proposed decoy pulses can easily be added to the software
by users. Meanwhile, the hardware components of the architecture proposed in
this paper take care of eliminating, i.e. attenuating, the decoy pulses inside
the superconducting quantum computer's dilution refrigerator before they reach
the qubits. The hardware architecture also contains tamper-resistant features
to protect the trusted hardware and users' information. The work leverages a
new metric of variational distance to analyze the impact and scalability of
hardware protection. The variational distance of the circuits protected with
our scheme, compared to unprotected circuits, is in the range of only $0.16$ to
$0.26$. This work demonstrates that protection from possibly malicious cloud
providers is feasible and all the hardware components needed for the proposed
architecture are available today.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we address the problem of system identification and control of
a front-steered vehicle which abides by the Ackermann geometry constraints.
This problem arises naturally for on-road and off-road vehicles that require
reliable system identification and basic feedback controllers for various
applications such as lane keeping and way-point navigation. Traditional system
identification requires expensive equipment and is time consuming. In this work
we explore the use of differentiable physics for system identification and
controller design and make the following contributions: i)We develop a
differentiable physics simulator (DPS) to provide a method for the system
identification of front-steered class of vehicles whose system parameters are
learned using a gradient-based method; ii) We provide results for our
gradient-based method that exhibit better sample efficiency in comparison to
other gradient-free methods; iii) We validate the learned system parameters by
implementing a feedback controller to demonstrate stable lane keeping
performance on a real front-steered vehicle, the F1TENTH; iv) Further, we
provide results exhibiting comparable lane keeping behavior for system
parameters learned using our gradient-based method with lane keeping behavior
of the actual system parameters of the F1TENTH.

<p class="mathjax">Developability refers to the process of creating a surface without any
tearing or shearing from a two-dimensional plane. It finds practical
applications in the fabrication industry. An essential characteristic of a
developable 3D surface is its zero Gaussian curvature, which means that either
one or both of the principal curvatures are zero. This paper introduces a
method for reconstructing an approximate developable surface from a neural
implicit surface. The central idea of our method involves incorporating a
regularization term that operates on the second-order derivatives of the neural
implicits, effectively promoting zero Gaussian curvature. Implicit surfaces
offer the advantage of smoother deformation with infinite resolution,
overcoming the high polygonal constraints of state-of-the-art methods using
discrete representations. We draw inspiration from the properties of surface
curvature and employ rank minimization techniques derived from compressed
sensing. Experimental results on both developable and non-developable surfaces,
including those affected by noise, validate the generalizability of our method.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the design and implementation of FLIPS, a middleware
system to manage data and participant heterogeneity in federated learning (FL)
training workloads. In particular, we examine the benefits of label
distribution clustering on participant selection in federated learning. FLIPS
clusters parties involved in an FL training job based on the label distribution
of their data apriori, and during FL training, ensures that each cluster is
equitably represented in the participants selected. FLIPS can support the most
common FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, FedOpt and FedYogi. To
manage platform heterogeneity and dynamic resource availability, FLIPS
incorporates a straggler management mechanism to handle changing capacities in
distributed, smart community applications. Privacy of label distributions,
clustering and participant selection is ensured through a trusted execution
environment (TEE). Our comprehensive empirical evaluation compares FLIPS with
random participant selection, as well as two other "smart" selection mechanisms
- Oort and gradient clustering using two real-world datasets, two different
non-IID distributions and three common FL algorithms (FedYogi, FedProx and
FedAvg). We demonstrate that FLIPS significantly improves convergence,
achieving higher accuracy by 17 - 20 % with 20 - 60 % lower communication
costs, and these benefits endure in the presence of straggler participants.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate variability overweighting, a previously undocumented bias in
line graphs, where estimates of average value are biased toward areas of higher
variability in that line. We found this effect across two preregistered
experiments with 140 and 420 participants. These experiments also show that the
bias is reduced when using a dot encoding of the same series. We can model the
bias with the average of the data series and the average of the points drawn
along the line. This bias might arise because higher variability leads to
stronger weighting in the average calculation, either due to the longer line
segments (even though those segments contain the same number of data values) or
line segments with higher variability being otherwise more visually salient.
Understanding and predicting this bias is important for visualization design
guidelines, recommendation systems, and tool builders, as the bias can
adversely affect estimates of averages and trends.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate properties and limitations of invariance
learned by neural networks from the data compared to the genuine invariance
achieved through invariant weight-tying. To do so, we adopt a group theoretical
perspective and analyze invariance learning in neural networks without
weight-tying constraints. We demonstrate that even when a network learns to
correctly classify samples on a group orbit, the underlying decision-making in
such a model does not attain genuine invariance. Instead, learned invariance is
strongly conditioned on the input data, rendering it unreliable if the input
distribution shifts. We next demonstrate how to guide invariance learning
toward genuine invariance by regularizing the invariance of a model at the
training. To this end, we propose several metrics to quantify learned
invariance: (i) predictive distribution invariance, (ii) logit invariance, and
(iii) saliency invariance similarity. We show that the invariance learned with
the invariance error regularization closely reassembles the genuine invariance
of weight-tying models and reliably holds even under a severe input
distribution shift. Closer analysis of the learned invariance also reveals the
spectral decay phenomenon, when a network chooses to achieve the invariance to
a specific transformation group by reducing the sensitivity to any input
perturbation.

<p class="mathjax">We present a Multimodal Backdoor Defense technique TIJO (Trigger Inversion
using Joint Optimization). Recent work <a href="/abs/2112.07668">arXiv:2112.07668</a> has demonstrated
successful backdoor attacks on multimodal models for the Visual Question
Answering task. Their dual-key backdoor trigger is split across two modalities
(image and text), such that the backdoor is activated if and only if the
trigger is present in both modalities. We propose TIJO that defends against
dual-key attacks through a joint optimization that reverse-engineers the
trigger in both the image and text modalities. This joint optimization is
challenging in multimodal models due to the disconnected nature of the visual
pipeline which consists of an offline feature extractor, whose output is then
fused with the text using a fusion module. The key insight enabling the joint
optimization in TIJO is that the trigger inversion needs to be carried out in
the object detection box feature space as opposed to the pixel space. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the TrojVQA benchmark, where
TIJO improves upon the state-of-the-art unimodal methods from an AUC of 0.6 to
0.92 on multimodal dual-key backdoors. Furthermore, our method also improves
upon the unimodal baselines on unimodal backdoors. We present ablation studies
and qualitative results to provide insights into our algorithm such as the
critical importance of overlaying the inverted feature triggers on all visual
features during trigger inversion. The prototype implementation of TIJO is
available at https://github.com/SRI-CSL/TIJO.

<p class="mathjax">Growing apprehensions surrounding public safety have captured the attention
of numerous governments and security agencies across the globe. These entities
are increasingly acknowledging the imperative need for reliable and secure
crowd-monitoring systems to address these concerns. Effectively managing human
gatherings necessitates proactive measures to prevent unforeseen events or
complications, ensuring a safe and well-coordinated environment. The scarcity
of research focusing on crowd monitoring systems and their security
implications has given rise to a burgeoning area of investigation, exploring
potential approaches to safeguard human congregations effectively. Crowd
monitoring systems depend on a bifurcated approach, encompassing vision-based
and non-vision-based technologies. An in-depth analysis of these two
methodologies will be conducted in this research. The efficacy of these
approaches is contingent upon the specific environment and temporal context in
which they are deployed, as they each offer distinct advantages. This paper
endeavors to present an in-depth analysis of the recent incorporation of
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and models into automated systems,
emphasizing their contemporary applications and effectiveness in various

<p class="mathjax">Video Action Recognition (VAR) is a challenging task due to its inherent
complexities. Though different approaches have been explored in the literature,
designing a unified framework to recognize a large number of human actions is
still a challenging problem. Recently, Multi-Modal Learning (MML) has
demonstrated promising results in this domain. In literature, 2D skeleton or
pose modality has often been used for this task, either independently or in
conjunction with the visual information (RGB modality) present in videos.
However, the combination of pose, visual information, and text attributes has
not been explored yet, though text and pose attributes independently have been
proven to be effective in numerous computer vision tasks. In this paper, we
present the first pose augmented Vision-language model (VLM) for VAR. Notably,
our scheme achieves an accuracy of 92.81% and 73.02% on two popular human video
action recognition benchmark datasets, UCF-101 and HMDB-51, respectively, even
without any video data pre-training, and an accuracy of 96.11% and 75.75% after
kinetics pre-training.

<p class="mathjax">The dominance of machine learning and the ending of Moore's law have renewed
interests in Processor in Memory (PIM) architectures. This interest has
produced several recent proposals to modify an FPGA's BRAM architecture to form
a next-generation PIM reconfigurable fabric. PIM architectures can also be
realized within today's FPGAs as overlays without the need to modify the
underlying FPGA architecture. To date, there has been no study to understand
the comparative advantages of the two approaches. In this paper, we present a
study that explores the comparative advantages between two proposed custom
architectures and a PIM overlay running on a commodity FPGA. We created PiCaSO,
a Processor in/near Memory Scalable and Fast Overlay architecture as a
representative PIM overlay. The results of this study show that the PiCaSO
overlay achieves up to 80% of the peak throughput of the custom designs with
2.56x shorter latency and 25% - 43% better BRAM memory utilization efficiency.
We then show how several key features of the PiCaSO overlay can be integrated
into the custom PIM designs to further improve their throughput by 18%, latency
by 19.5%, and memory efficiency by 6.2%.

<p class="mathjax">Nonlinear materials are often difficult to model with classical state model
theory because they have a complex and sometimes inaccurate physical and
mathematical description or we simply do not know how to describe such
materials in terms of relations between external and internal variables. In
many disciplines, Neural Network methods have arisen as powerful tools to
identify very complex and non-linear correlations. In this work, we use the
very recently developed concept of Physically Guided Neural Networks with
Internal Variables (PGNNIV) to discover constitutive laws using a model-free
approach and training solely with measured force-displacement data. PGNNIVs
make a particular use of the physics of the problem to enforce constraints on
specific hidden layers and are able to make predictions without internal
variable data. We demonstrate that PGNNIVs are capable of predicting both
internal and external variables under unseen load scenarios, regardless of the
nature of the material considered (linear, with hardening or softening behavior
and hyperelastic), unravelling the constitutive law of the material hence
explaining its nature altogether, placing the method in what is known as
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a state-of-the-art model for transcribing speech in any
language into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Transcription of
spoken languages into IPA is an essential yet time-consuming process in
language documentation, and even partially automating this process has the
potential to drastically speed up the documentation of endangered languages.
Like the previous best speech-to-IPA model (Wav2Vec2Phoneme), our model is
based on wav2vec 2.0 and is fine-tuned to predict IPA from audio input. We use
training data from seven languages from CommonVoice 11.0, transcribed into IPA
semi-automatically. Although this training dataset is much smaller than
Wav2Vec2Phoneme's, its higher quality lets our model achieve comparable or
better results. Furthermore, we show that the quality of our universal
speech-to-IPA models is close to that of human annotators.

<p class="mathjax">Traditionally, distributed and parallel transactional systems have been
studied in isolation, as they targeted different applications and experienced
different bottlenecks. However, modern high-bandwidth networks have made the
study of systems that are both distributed (i.e., employ multiple nodes) and
parallel (i.e., employ multiple cores per node) necessary to truly make use of
the available hardware.
<br />In this paper, we study the performance of these combined systems and show
that there are inherent tradeoffs between a system's ability to have fast and
robust distributed communication and its ability to scale to multiple cores.
More precisely, we formalize the notions of a \emph{fast deciding} path of
communication to commit transactions quickly in good executions, and
\emph{seamless fault tolerance} that allows systems to remain robust to server
failures. We then show that there is an inherent tension between these two
natural distributed properties and well-known multicore scalability properties
in transactional systems. Finally, we show positive results; it is possible to
construct a parallel distributed transactional system if any one of the
properties we study is removed.

<p class="mathjax">Creative coding tasks are often exploratory in nature. When producing digital
artwork, artists usually begin with a high-level semantic construct such as a
"stained glass filter" and programmatically implement it by varying code
parameters such as shape, color, lines, and opacity to produce visually
appealing results. Based on interviews with artists, it can be effortful to
translate semantic constructs to program syntax, and current programming tools
don't lend well to rapid creative exploration. To address these challenges, we
introduce Spellburst, a large language model (LLM) powered creative-coding
environment. Spellburst provides (1) a node-based interface that allows artists
to create generative art and explore variations through branching and merging
operations, (2) expressive prompt-based interactions to engage in semantic
programming, and (3) dynamic prompt-driven interfaces and direct code editing
to seamlessly switch between semantic and syntactic exploration. Our evaluation
with artists demonstrates Spellburst's potential to enhance creative coding
practices and inform the design of computational creativity tools that bridge
semantic and syntactic spaces.

<p class="mathjax">Maintaining accurate provenance records is paramount in digital forensics, as
they underpin evidence credibility and integrity, addressing essential aspects
like accountability and reproducibility. Blockchains have several properties
that can address these requirements. Previous systems utilized public
blockchains, i.e., treated blockchain as a black box, and benefiting from the
immutability property. However, the blockchain was accessible to everyone,
giving rise to security concerns and moreover, efficient extraction of
provenance faces challenges due to the enormous scale and complexity of digital
data. This necessitates a tailored blockchain design for digital forensics. Our
solution, Forensiblock has a novel design that automates investigation steps,
ensures secure data access, traces data origins, preserves records, and
expedites provenance extraction. Forensiblock incorporates Role-Based Access
Control with Staged Authorization (RBAC-SA) and a distributed Merkle root for
case tracking. These features support authorized resource access with an
efficient retrieval of provenance records. Particularly, comparing two methods
for extracting provenance records off chain storage retrieval with Merkle root
verification and a brute-force search the offchain method is significantly
better, especially as the blockchain size and number of cases increase. We also
found that our distributed Merkle root creation slightly increases smart
contract processing time but significantly improves history access. Overall, we
show that Forensiblock offers secure, efficient, and reliable handling of
digital forensic data

<p class="mathjax">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as indispensable assets in
medicine, and are currently at the forefront of biopharmaceutical product
development. However, the growing market demand and the substantial doses
required for mAb clinical treatments necessitate significant progress in its
large-scale production. Most of the processes for industrial mAb production
rely on batch operations, which result in significant downtime. The shift
towards a fully continuous and integrated manufacturing process holds the
potential to boost product yield and quality, while eliminating the extra
expenses associated with storing intermediate products. The integrated
continuous mAb production process can be divided into the upstream and
downstream processes. One crucial aspect that ensures the continuity of the
integrated process is the switching of the capture columns, which are typically
chromatography columns operated in a fed-batch manner downstream. Due to the
discrete nature of the switching operation, advanced process control algorithms
such as economic MPC (EMPC) are computationally difficult to implement. This is
because an integer nonlinear program (INLP) needs to be solved online at each
sampling time. This paper introduces two computationally-efficient approaches
for EMPC implementation, namely, a sigmoid function approximation approach and
a rectified linear unit (ReLU) approximation approach. It also explores the
application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). These three methods are
compared to the traditional switching approach which is based on a 1% product
breakthrough rule and which involves no optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Methods: Through an innovative approach, we construct ontology-based
knowledge graphs from authentic medical literature and AI-generated content.
Our goal is to distinguish factual information from unverified data. We
compiled two datasets: one from biomedical literature using a "human disease
and symptoms" query, and another generated by ChatGPT, simulating articles.
With these datasets (PubMed and ChatGPT), we curated 10 sets of 250 abstracts
each, selected randomly with a specific seed. Our method focuses on utilizing
disease ontology (DOID) and symptom ontology (SYMP) to build knowledge graphs,
robust mathematical models that facilitate unbiased comparisons. By employing
our fact-checking algorithms and network centrality metrics, we conducted GPT
disease-symptoms link analysis to quantify the accuracy of factual knowledge
amid noise, hypotheses, and significant findings.
<br />Results: The findings obtained from the comparison of diverse ChatGPT
knowledge graphs with their PubMed counterparts revealed some interesting
observations. While PubMed knowledge graphs exhibit a wealth of disease-symptom
terms, it is surprising to observe that some ChatGPT graphs surpass them in the
number of connections. Furthermore, some GPT graphs are demonstrating supremacy
of the centrality scores, especially for the overlapping nodes. This striking
contrast indicates the untapped potential of knowledge that can be derived from
AI-generated content, awaiting verification. Out of all the graphs, the factual
link ratio between any two graphs reached its peak at 60%.
<br />Conclusions: An intriguing insight from our findings was the striking number
of links among terms in the knowledge graph generated from ChatGPT datasets,
surpassing some of those in its PubMed counterpart. This early discovery has
prompted further investigation using universal network metrics to unveil the
new knowledge the links may hold.

<p class="mathjax">Partitioned communication was introduced in MPI 4.0 as a user-friendly
interface to support pipelined communication patterns, particularly common in
the context of MPI+threads. It provides the user with the ability to divide a
global buffer into smaller independent chunks, called partitions, which can
then be communicated independently. In this work we first model the performance
gain that can be expected when using partitioned communication. Next, we
describe the improvements we made to \mpich{} to enable those gains and provide
a high-quality implementation of MPI partitioned communication. We then
evaluate partitioned communication in various common use cases and assess the
performance in comparison with other MPI point-to-point and one-sided
approaches. Specifically, we first investigate two scenarios commonly
encountered for small partition sizes in a multithreaded environment: thread
contention and overhead of using many partitions. We propose two solutions to
alleviate the measured penalty and demonstrate their use. We then focus on
large messages and the gain obtained when exploiting the delay resulting from
computations or load imbalance. We conclude with our perspectives on the
benefits of partitioned communication and the various results obtained.

<p class="mathjax">Continuum robots, made from flexible materials with continuous backbones,
have several advantages over traditional rigid robots. Some of them are the
ability to navigate through narrow or confined spaces, adapt to irregular or
changing environments, and perform tasks in proximity to humans. However, one
of the challenges in using continuum robots is the difficulty in accurately
estimating their state, such as their tip position and curvature. This is due
to the complexity of their kinematics and the inherent uncertainty in their
measurement and control. This paper proposes a moving horizon estimation (MHE)
approach for estimating the robot's state, including its tip position and shape
parameters. Our approach involves minimizing the error between measurement
samples from an IMU attached to the robot's tip and the estimated state along
the estimation horizon using an inline optimization problem. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through simulation and experimental results. Our
approach can potentially improve the accuracy and robustness of state
estimation and control for continuum robots. It can be applied to various
applications such as surgery, manufacturing, and inspection.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an exhaustive methodology that leverages all levels of feature
abstraction, targeting an enhancement in the generalizability of image
classification to unobserved hospitals. Our approach incorporates
augmentation-based self-supervision with common distribution shifts in
histopathology scenarios serving as the pretext task. This enables us to derive
invariant features from training images without relying on training labels,
thereby covering different abstraction levels. Moving onto the subsequent
abstraction level, we employ a domain alignment module to facilitate further
extraction of invariant features across varying training hospitals. To
represent the highly specific features of participating hospitals, an encoder
is trained to classify hospital labels, independent of their diagnostic labels.
The features from each of these encoders are subsequently disentangled to
minimize redundancy and segregate the features. This representation, which
spans a broad spectrum of semantic information, enables the development of a
model demonstrating increased robustness to unseen images from disparate
distributions. Experimental results from the PACS dataset (a domain
generalization benchmark), a synthetic dataset created by applying
histopathology-specific jitters to the MHIST dataset (defining different
domains with varied distribution shifts), and a Renal Cell Carcinoma dataset
derived from four image repositories from TCGA, collectively indicate that our
proposed model is adept at managing varying levels of image granularity. Thus,
it shows improved generalizability when faced with new, out-of-distribution
hospital images.

<p class="mathjax">Auto-white balance (AWB) correction is a critical operation in image signal
processors for accurate and consistent color correction across various
illumination scenarios. This paper presents a novel and efficient AWB
correction method that achieves at least 35 times faster processing with
equivalent or superior performance on high-resolution images for the current
state-of-the-art methods. Inspired by deterministic color style transfer, our
approach introduces deterministic illumination color mapping, leveraging
learnable projection matrices for both canonical illumination form and
AWB-corrected output. It involves feeding high-resolution images and
corresponding latent representations into a mapping module to derive a
canonical form, followed by another mapping module that maps the pixel values
to those for the corrected version. This strategy is designed as
resolution-agnostic and also enables seamless integration of any pre-trained
AWB network as the backbone. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
our approach, revealing significant performance improvements and reduced time
complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method provides an
efficient deep learning-based AWB correction solution, promising real-time,
high-quality color correction for digital imaging applications. Source code is

<p class="mathjax">(1) Background: This study employs a simulation-based approach, adapting the
waterfall model, to provides estimates for projects and individual phase
completion times. Additionally, it pin-points potential efficiency issues
stemming from a suboptimal resource level. It further demonstrates how one can
go on to identify a resource level that effectively eliminates bottlenecks and
curtails the idle time of resources. (2) Methods: We implement our software
development lifecycle using SimPy, a discrete-event simulation framework
written in Python. Our model is executed on 100 projects of varying sizes over
three stages. The first, pre-optimization, provides insight based on the
initial set of resources. This is followed by the optimization stage, which
serves to identify the optimal number of resources to eliminate bottlenecks and
minimize idle time. The third stage, post-optimization, evaluates the resource
optimized model. (3) Results: The analysis of the simulation-generated data
reveals the presence of resource bottlenecks during the pre-optimization stage,
particularly in the implementation phase. These dissipate after optimization.
(4) Conclusions: The findings emphasize the advantage of using simulation as a
safe and effective way to experiment and plan for software development
projects. Such simulations also allow those man-aging software development
projects to make accurate, evidence-based projections as to phase and project
completion times and identify optimal resource levels and their interplay. In
particular, understanding the tradeoffs between experiencing delayed completion
times and procuring additional resources to alleviate any bottlenecks.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce GraPhSyM, a Graph Attention Network (GATv2) model
for fast and accurate estimation of post-physical synthesis circuit delay and
area metrics from pre-physical synthesis circuit netlists. Once trained,
GraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDA
stages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesis
flow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swift
and precise feedback provided by GraPhSym is instrumental for
machine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlist
of a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure,
connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of
physical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing.
When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an
aggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis
delay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s
inference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by
employing the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate
post-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report
promising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is
evaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on.
The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for
advanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learning
frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to recognize actions of
unseen categories after training on data of seen categories. The key is to
build the connection between visual and semantic space from seen to unseen
classes. Previous studies have primarily focused on encoding sequences into a
singular feature vector, with subsequent mapping the features to an identical
anchor point within the embedded space. Their performance is hindered by 1) the
ignorance of the global visual/semantic distribution alignment, which results
in a limitation to capture the true interdependence between the two spaces. 2)
the negligence of temporal information since the frame-wise features with rich
action clues are directly pooled into a single feature vector. We propose a new
zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition method via mutual information (MI)
estimation and maximization. Specifically, 1) we maximize the MI between visual
and semantic space for distribution alignment; 2) we leverage the temporal
information for estimating the MI by encouraging MI to increase as more frames
are observed. Extensive experiments on three large-scale skeleton action
datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method. Code:

<p class="mathjax">Cloud computing has become popular thanks to the widespread use of
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, allowing the community to conveniently
manage and configure cloud infrastructure using scripts. However, the scripting
process itself does not automatically prevent practitioners from introducing
misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or privacy risks. As a result, ensuring
security relies on practitioners understanding and the adoption of explicit
policies, guidelines, or best practices. In order to understand how
practitioners deal with this problem, in this work, we perform an empirical
study analyzing the adoption of IaC scripted security best practices. First, we
select and categorize widely recognized Terraform security practices
promulgated in the industry for popular cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and
Google Cloud. Next, we assess the adoption of these practices by each cloud
provider, analyzing a sample of 812 open-source projects hosted on GitHub. For
that, we scan each project configuration files, looking for policy
implementation through static analysis (checkov). Additionally, we investigate
GitHub measures that might be correlated with adopting these best practices.
The category Access policy emerges as the most widely adopted in all providers,
while Encryption in rest are the most neglected policies. Regarding GitHub
measures correlated with best practice adoption, we observe a positive, strong
correlation between a repository number of stars and adopting practices in its
cloud infrastructure. Based on our findings, we provide guidelines for cloud
practitioners to limit infrastructure vulnerability and discuss further aspects
associated with policies that have yet to be extensively embraced within the
industry.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has emerged as an effective solution for addressing the
challenges of short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) in power systems.
However, existing deep learning-based STVSA approaches face limitations in
adapting to topological changes, sample labeling, and handling small datasets.
To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel phasor measurement
unit (PMU) measurements-based STVSA method by using deep transfer learning. The
method leverages the real-time dynamic information captured by PMUs to create
an initial dataset. It employs temporal ensembling for sample labeling and
utilizes least squares generative adversarial networks (LSGAN) for data
augmentation, enabling effective deep learning on small-scale datasets.
Additionally, the method enhances adaptability to topological changes by
exploring connections between different faults. Experimental results on the
IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed method improves model
evaluation accuracy by approximately 20% through transfer learning, exhibiting
strong adaptability to topological changes. Leveraging the self-attention
mechanism of the Transformer model, this approach offers significant advantages
over shallow learning methods and other deep learning-based approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The vulnerability to adversarial perturbations is a major flaw of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) that raises question about their reliability when in real-world
scenarios. On the other hand, human perception, which DNNs are supposed to
emulate, is highly robust to such perturbations, indicating that there may be
certain features of the human perception that make it robust but are not
represented in the current class of DNNs. One such feature is that the activity
of biological neurons is correlated and the structure of this correlation tends
to be rather rigid over long spans of times, even if it hampers performance and
learning. We hypothesize that integrating such constraints on the activations
of a DNN would improve its adversarial robustness, and, to test this
hypothesis, we have developed the Self-Consistent Activation (SCA) layer, which
comprises of neurons whose activations are consistent with each other, as they
conform to a fixed, but learned, covariability pattern. When evaluated on image
and sound recognition tasks, the models with a SCA layer achieved high
accuracy, and exhibited significantly greater robustness than multi-layer
perceptron models to state-of-the-art Auto-PGD adversarial attacks

<p class="mathjax">Sycophancy is an undesirable behavior where models tailor their responses to
follow a human user's view even when that view is not objectively correct
(e.g., adapting liberal views once a user reveals that they are liberal). In
this paper, we study the prevalence of sycophancy in language models and
propose a simple synthetic-data intervention to reduce this behavior.
<br />First, on a set of three sycophancy tasks (Perez et al., 2022) where models
are asked for an opinion on statements with no correct answers (e.g.,
politics), we observe that both model scaling and instruction tuning
significantly increase sycophancy for PaLM models up to 540B parameters.
Second, we extend sycophancy evaluations to simple addition statements that are
objectively incorrect, finding that despite knowing that these statements are
wrong, language models will still agree with them if the user does as well.
<br />To reduce sycophancy, we present a straightforward synthetic-data
intervention that takes public NLP tasks and encourages models to be robust to
user opinions on these tasks. Adding these data in a lightweight finetuning
step can significantly reduce sycophantic behavior on held-out prompts. Code
for generating synthetic data for intervention can be found at

<p class="mathjax">Preliminary trajectory design is a global search problem that seeks multiple
qualitatively different solutions to a trajectory optimization problem. Due to
its high dimensionality and non-convexity, and the frequent adjustment of
problem parameters, the global search becomes computationally demanding. In
this paper, we exploit the clustering structure in the solutions and propose an
amortized global search (AmorGS) framework. We use deep generative models to
predict trajectory solutions that share similar structures with previously
solved problems, which accelerates the global search for unseen parameter
values. Our method is evaluated using De Jong's 5th function and a low-thrust

<p class="mathjax">How to identify those equivalent entities between knowledge graphs (KGs),
which is called Entity Alignment (EA), is a long-standing challenge. So far,
many methods have been proposed, with recent focus on leveraging Deep Learning
to solve this problem. However, we observe that most of the efforts has been
paid to having better representation of entities, rather than improving entity
matching from the learned representations. In fact, how to efficiently infer
the entity pairs from this similarity matrix, which is essentially a matching
problem, has been largely ignored by the community. Motivated by this
observation, we conduct an in-depth analysis on existing algorithms that are
particularly designed for solving this matching problem, and propose a novel
matching method, named Bidirectional Matching (BMat). Our extensive
experimental results on public datasets indicate that there is currently no
single silver bullet solution for EA. In other words, different classes of
entity similarity estimation may require different matching algorithms to reach
the best EA results for each class. We finally conclude that using PARIS, the
state-of-the-art EA approach, with BMat gives the best combination in terms of
EA performance and the algorithm's time and space complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is
a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and
tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every
transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their
data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for
them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling
as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual
summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and
thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support
continuous data profiling: it automatically displays data distributions and
summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; it is live, so
visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data
updates; it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for
the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two
versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both
automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one
version updates reactively and the other updates only on demand. We find that
both tools facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights
originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users.
Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their
transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look
at past visualizations. We also present a longitudinal case study on how
AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their
data through automatic, live data profiles. Our results have implications for
the design of future tools that offer automated data analysis support.

<p class="mathjax">Platooning connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) provide significant
benefits in terms of traffic efficiency and fuel economy. However, most
existing platooning systems assume the availability of pre-determined plans,
which is not feasible in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we address this
issue in time-dependent networks by formulating a Markov decision process at
each junction, aiming to minimize travel time and fuel consumption. Initially,
we analyze coordinated platooning without routing to explore the cooperation
among controllers on an identical path. We propose two novel approaches based
on approximate dynamic programming, offering suboptimal control in the context
of a stochastic finite horizon problem. The results demonstrate the superiority
of the approximation in the policy space. Furthermore, we investigate
platooning in a network setting, where speed profiles and routes are determined
simultaneously. To simplify the problem, we decouple the action space by
prioritizing routing decisions based on travel time estimation. We subsequently
employ the aforementioned policy approximation to determine speed profiles,
considering essential parameters such as travel times. Our simulation results
in SUMO indicate that our method yields better performance than conventional
approaches, leading to potential travel cost savings of up to 40%.
Additionally, we evaluate the resilience of our approach in dynamically
changing networks, affirming its ability to maintain efficient platooning
operations.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image classification poses unique challenges due to the long-tailed
distribution of diseases, the co-occurrence of diagnostic findings, and the
multiple views available for each study or patient. This paper introduces our
solution to the ICCV CVAMD 2023 Shared Task on CXR-LT: Multi-Label Long-Tailed
Classification on Chest X-Rays. Our approach introduces CheXFusion, a
transformer-based fusion module incorporating multi-view images. The fusion
module, guided by self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, efficiently
aggregates multi-view features while considering label co-occurrence.
Furthermore, we explore data balancing and self-training methods to optimize
the model's performance. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art results with
0.372 mAP in the MIMIC-CXR test set, securing 1st place in the competition. Our
success in the task underscores the significance of considering multi-view

<p class="mathjax">Many statistical inference contexts, including Bayesian Networks (BNs),
Markov processes and Hidden Markov Models (HMMS) could be supported by
partitioning (i.e.~mapping) the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into
clusters. However, optimal partitioning is challenging, especially in
statistical inference as the cost to be optimised is dependent on both nodes
within a cluster, and the mapping of clusters connected via parent and/or child
nodes, which we call dependent clusters. We propose a novel algorithm called
DCMAP for optimal cluster mapping with dependent clusters. Given an arbitrarily
defined, positive cost function based on the DAG and cluster mappings, we show
that DCMAP converges to find all optimal clusters, and returns near-optimal
solutions along the way. Empirically, we find that the algorithm is
time-efficient for a DBN model of a seagrass complex system using a computation
cost function. For a 25 and 50-node DBN, the search space size was $9.91\times
10^9$ and $1.51\times10^{21}$ possible cluster mappings, respectively, but
near-optimal solutions with 88\% and 72\% similarity to the optimal solution
were found at iterations 170 and 865, respectively. The first optimal solution
was found at iteration 934 $(\text{95\% CI } 926,971)$, and 2256 $(2150,2271)$
with a cost that was 4\% and 0.2\% of the naive heuristic cost, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This paper evaluates the efficacy of recent commercial processing-in-memory
(PIM) solutions to accelerate fast Fourier transform (FFT), an important
primitive across several domains. Specifically, we observe that efficient
implementations of FFT on modern GPUs are memory bandwidth bound. As such, the
memory bandwidth boost availed by commercial PIM solutions makes a case for PIM
to accelerate FFT. To this end, we first deduce a mapping of FFT computation to
a strawman PIM architecture representative of recent commercial designs. We
observe that even with careful data mapping, PIM is not effective in
accelerating FFT. To address this, we make a case for collaborative
acceleration of FFT with PIM and GPU. Further, we propose software and hardware
innovations which lower PIM operations necessary for a given FFT. Overall, our
optimized PIM FFT mapping, termed Pimacolaba, delivers performance and data
movement savings of up to 1.38$\times$ and 2.76$\times$, respectively, over a
range of FFT sizes.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton-based human action
understanding, which is an important yet challenging topic. Previous works
mainly rely on contrastive learning or masked motion modeling paradigm to model
the skeleton relations. However, the sequence-level and joint-level
representation learning cannot be effectively and simultaneously handled by
these methods. As a result, the learned representations fail to generalize to
different downstream tasks. Moreover, combining these two paradigms in a naive
manner leaves the synergy between them untapped and can lead to interference in
training. To address these problems, we propose Prompted Contrast with Masked
Motion Modeling, PCM$^{\rm 3}$, for versatile 3D action representation
learning. Our method integrates the contrastive learning and masked prediction
tasks in a mutually beneficial manner, which substantially boosts the
generalization capacity for various downstream tasks. Specifically, masked
prediction provides novel training views for contrastive learning, which in
turn guides the masked prediction training with high-level semantic
information. Moreover, we propose a dual-prompted multi-task pretraining
strategy, which further improves model representations by reducing the
interference caused by learning the two different pretext tasks. Extensive
experiments on five downstream tasks under three large-scale datasets are
conducted, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of PCM$^{\rm 3}$
compared to the state-of-the-art works. Our project is publicly available at:

<p class="mathjax">Synthetic image datasets offer unmatched advantages for designing and
evaluating deep neural networks: they make it possible to (i) render as many
data samples as needed, (ii) precisely control each scene and yield granular
ground truth labels (and captions), (iii) precisely control distribution shifts
between training and testing to isolate variables of interest for sound
experimentation. Despite such promise, the use of synthetic image data is still
limited -- and often played down -- mainly due to their lack of realism. Most
works therefore rely on datasets of real images, which have often been scraped
from public images on the internet, and may have issues with regards to
privacy, bias, and copyright, while offering little control over how objects
precisely appear. In this work, we present a path to democratize the use of
photorealistic synthetic data: we develop a new generation of interactive
environments for representation learning research, that offer both
controllability and realism. We use the Unreal Engine, a powerful game engine
well known in the entertainment industry, to produce PUG (Photorealistic Unreal
Graphics) environments and datasets for representation learning. In this paper,
we demonstrate the potential of PUG to enable more rigorous evaluations of
vision models.

<p class="mathjax">Infrared and visible image fusion is a powerful technique that combines
complementary information from different modalities for downstream semantic
perception tasks. Existing learning-based methods show remarkable performance,
but are suffering from the inherent vulnerability of adversarial attacks,
causing a significant decrease in accuracy. In this work, a perception-aware
fusion framework is proposed to promote segmentation robustness in adversarial
scenes. We first conduct systematic analyses about the components of image
fusion, investigating the correlation with segmentation robustness under
adversarial perturbations. Based on these analyses, we propose a harmonized
architecture search with a decomposition-based structure to balance standard
accuracy and robustness. We also propose an adaptive learning strategy to
improve the parameter robustness of image fusion, which can learn effective
feature extraction under diverse adversarial perturbations. Thus, the goals of
image fusion (\textit{i.e.,} extracting complementary features from source
modalities and defending attack) can be realized from the perspectives of
architectural and learning strategies. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our scheme substantially enhances the robustness, with gains
of 15.3% mIOU of segmentation in the adversarial scene, compared with advanced
competitors. The source codes are available at

<p class="mathjax">Recently, polar-based representation has shown promising properties in
perceptual tasks. In addition to Cartesian-based approaches, which separate
point clouds unevenly, representing point clouds as polar grids has been
recognized as an alternative due to (1) its advantage in robust performance
under different resolutions and (2) its superiority in streaming-based
approaches. However, state-of-the-art polar-based detection methods inevitably
suffer from the feature distortion problem because of the non-uniform division
of polar representation, resulting in a non-negligible performance gap compared
to Cartesian-based approaches. To tackle this issue, we present PARTNER, a
novel 3D object detector in the polar coordinate. PARTNER alleviates the
dilemma of feature distortion with global representation re-alignment and
facilitates the regression by introducing instance-level geometric information
into the detection head. Extensive experiments show overwhelming advantages in
streaming-based detection and different resolutions. Furthermore, our method
outperforms the previous polar-based works with remarkable margins of 3.68% and
9.15% on Waymo and ONCE validation set, thus achieving competitive results over
the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Global urbanization has underscored the significance of urban microclimates
for human comfort, health, and building/urban energy efficiency. They
profoundly influence building design and urban planning as major environmental
impacts. Understanding local microclimates is essential for cities to prepare
for climate change and effectively implement resilience measures. However,
analyzing urban microclimates requires considering a complex array of outdoor
parameters within computational domains at the city scale over a longer period
than indoors. As a result, numerical methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) become computationally expensive when evaluating the impact of urban
microclimates. The rise of deep learning techniques has opened new
opportunities for accelerating the modeling of complex non-linear interactions
and system dynamics. Recently, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has been shown
to be very promising in accelerating solving the Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) and modeling fluid dynamic systems. In this work, we apply the FNO
network for real-time three-dimensional (3D) urban wind field simulation. The
training and testing data are generated from CFD simulation of the urban area,
based on the semi-Lagrangian approach and fractional stepping method to
simulate urban microclimate features for modeling large-scale urban problems.
Numerical experiments show that the FNO model can accurately reconstruct the
instantaneous spatial velocity field. We further evaluate the trained FNO model
on unseen data with different wind directions, and the results show that the
FNO model can generalize well on different wind directions. More importantly,
the FNO approach can make predictions within milliseconds on the graphics
processing unit, making real-time simulation of 3D dynamic urban microclimate
possible.

their abstract writing skills. Nevertheless, this approach frequently falls
short in providing students with personalized and adaptable feedback on their
abstract writing. To address this gap, we initially conducted a formative study
to ascertain the user requirements for an abstract writing training tool.
Subsequently, we proposed a domain-specific abstract writing training tool
called ALens, which employs rhetorical structure parsing to identify key
concepts, evaluates abstract drafts based on linguistic features, and employs
visualization techniques to analyze the writing patterns of exemplary
abstracts. A comparative user study involving an alternative abstract writing
training tool has been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

engagement in computer science education. Leveraging a design-based research
approach, we develop, implement, and evaluate a novel learning environment
enriched with four distinct chatbot roles: Instructor Bot, Peer Bot, Career
Advising Bot, and Emotional Supporter Bot. These roles, designed around the
tenets of Self-Determination Theory, cater to the three innate psychological
needs of learners - competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Additionally, the
system embraces an inquiry-based learning paradigm, encouraging students to ask
questions, seek solutions, and explore their curiosities.
<br />We test this system in a higher education context over a period of one month
with 200 participating students, comparing outcomes with conditions involving a
human tutor and a single chatbot. Our research utilizes a mixed-methods
approach, encompassing quantitative measures such as chat log sequence
analysis, and qualitative methods including surveys and focus group interviews.
By integrating cutting-edge Natural Language Processing techniques such as
topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we offer an in-depth understanding of
the system's impact on learner engagement, motivation, and inquiry-based

<p class="mathjax">When considering initial stress field in geomaterial, nonzero resultant of
shallow tunnel excavation exists, which produces logarithmic items in complex
potentials, and would further lead to a unique displacement singularity at
infinity to violate geo-engineering fact in real world. The mechanical and
mathematical reasons of such a unique displacement singularity in the existing
mechanical models are elaborated, and a new mechanical model is subsequently
proposed to eliminate this singularity by constraining far-field ground surface
displacement, and the original unbalanced resultant problem is converted into
an equilibrium one with mixed boundary conditions. To solve stress and
displacement in the new model, the analytic continuation is applied to
transform the mixed boundary conditions into a homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert
problem with extra constraints, which is then solved using an approximate and
iterative method with good numerical stability. The Lanczos filtering is
applied to the stress and displacement solution to reduce the Gibbs phenomena
caused by abrupt change of the boundary conditions along ground surface.
Several numerical cases are conducted to verify the proposed mechanical model
and the results strongly validate that the proposed mechanical model
successfully eliminates the displacement singularity caused by unbalanced
resultant with good convergence and accuracy to obtain stress and displacement
for shallow tunnel excavation. A parametric investigation is subsequently
conducted to study the influence of tunnel depth, lateral coefficient, and free
surface range on stress and displacement distribution in geomaterial.

devices including low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), and ground users (GUs), holds significant promise for advancing smart
city applications. However, resource management of the SAGIN is a challenge
requiring urgent study in that inappropriate resource management will cause
poor data transmission, and hence affect the services in smart cities. In this
paper, we develop a comprehensive SAGIN system that encompasses five distinct
communication links and propose an efficient cooperative multi-type multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning (CMT-MARL) method to address the resource
management issue. The experimental results highlight the efficacy of the
proposed CMT-MARL, as evidenced by key performance indicators such as the
overall transmission rate and transmission success rate. These results
underscore the potential value and feasibility of future implementation of the
SAGIN.

<p class="mathjax">This study proposed a YOLOv5-based custom object detection model to detect
strawberries in an outdoor environment. The original architecture of the
YOLOv5s was modified by replacing the C3 module with the C2f module in the
backbone network, which provided a better feature gradient flow. Secondly, the
Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast in the final layer of the backbone network of
YOLOv5s was combined with Cross Stage Partial Net to improve the generalization
ability over the strawberry dataset in this study. The proposed architecture
was named YOLOv5s-Straw. The RGB images dataset of the strawberry canopy with
three maturity classes (immature, nearly mature, and mature) was collected in
open-field environment and augmented through a series of operations including
brightness reduction, brightness increase, and noise adding. To verify the
superiority of the proposed method for strawberry detection in open-field
environment, four competitive detection models (YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv5s,
YOLOv5s-C2f, and YOLOv8s) were trained, and tested under the same computational
environment and compared with YOLOv5s-Straw. The results showed that the
highest mean average precision of 80.3% was achieved using the proposed
architecture whereas the same was achieved with YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv5s,
YOLOv5s-C2f, and YOLOv8s were 73.4%, 77.8%, 79.8%, 79.3%, respectively.
Specifically, the average precision of YOLOv5s-Straw was 82.1% in the immature
class, 73.5% in the nearly mature class, and 86.6% in the mature class, which
were 2.3% and 3.7%, respectively, higher than that of the latest YOLOv8s. The
model included 8.6*10^6 network parameters with an inference speed of 18ms per
image while the inference speed of YOLOv8s had a slower inference speed of
21.0ms and heavy parameters of 11.1*10^6, which indicates that the proposed
model is fast enough for real time strawberry detection and localization for
the robotic picking.

<p class="mathjax">A major challenge in Explainable AI is in correctly interpreting activations
of hidden neurons: accurate interpretations would provide insights into the
question of what a deep learning system has internally detected as relevant on
the input, de-mystifying the otherwise black-box character of deep learning
systems. The state of the art indicates that hidden node activations can, in
some cases, be interpretable in a way that makes sense to humans, but
systematic automated methods that would be able to hypothesize and verify
interpretations of hidden neuron activations are underexplored. In this paper,
we provide such a method and demonstrate that it provides meaningful
interpretations. Our approach is based on using large-scale background
knowledge approximately 2 million classes curated from the Wikipedia concept
hierarchy together with a symbolic reasoning approach called Concept Induction
based on description logics, originally developed for applications in the
Semantic Web field. Our results show that we can automatically attach
meaningful labels from the background knowledge to individual neurons in the
dense layer of a Convolutional Neural Network through a hypothesis and
verification process

<p class="mathjax">In dynamic scenes, both localization and mapping in visual SLAM face
significant challenges. In recent years, numerous outstanding research works
have proposed effective solutions for the localization problem. However, there
has been a scarcity of excellent works focusing on constructing long-term
consistent maps in dynamic scenes, which severely hampers map applications. To
address this issue, we have designed a multi-level map construction system
tailored for dynamic scenes. In this system, we employ multi-object tracking
algorithms, DBSCAN clustering algorithm, and depth information to rectify the
results of object detection, accurately extract static point clouds, and
construct dense point cloud maps and octree maps. We propose a plane map
construction algorithm specialized for dynamic scenes, involving the
extraction, filtering, data association, and fusion optimization of planes in
dynamic environments, thus creating a plane map. Additionally, we introduce an
object map construction algorithm targeted at dynamic scenes, which includes
object parameterization, data association, and update optimization. Extensive
experiments on public datasets and real-world scenarios validate the accuracy
of the multi-level maps constructed in this study and the robustness of the
proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical application
prospects of our algorithms by utilizing the constructed object maps for
dynamic object tracking.

<p class="mathjax">Topology optimization is able to maximally leverage the high DOFs and
mechanical potentiality of porous foams but faces three fundamental challenges:
conforming to free-form outer shapes, maintaining geometric connectivity
between adjacent cells, and achieving high simulation accuracy. To resolve the
issues, borrowing the concept from Voronoi tessellation, we propose to use the
site (or seed) positions and radii of the beams as the DOFs for open-cell foam
design. Such DOFs cover extensive design space and have clear geometrical
meaning, which makes it easy to provide explicit controls (e.g. granularity).
During the gradient-based optimization, the foam topology can change freely,
and some seeds may even be pushed out of the shape, which greatly alleviates
the challenges of prescribing a fixed underlying grid. The mechanical property
of our foam is computed from its highly heterogeneous density field counterpart
discretized on a background mesh, with a much improved accuracy via a new
material-aware numerical coarsening method. We also explore the
differentiability of the open-cell Voronoi foams w.r.t. its seed locations, and
propose a local finite difference method to estimate the derivatives
efficiently. We do not only show the improved foam performance of our Voronoi
foam in comparison with classical topology optimization approaches, but also
demonstrate its advantages in various settings, especially when the target
volume fraction is extremely low.

We utilize the GPT-4 model to generate text descriptors that encapsulate the
shape and texture characteristics of objects in medical images. Subsequently,
these GPT-4 generated descriptors, alongside VLMs pre-trained on natural
images, are employed to classify chest X-rays and breast ultrasound images. Our
results indicate that few-shot classification of medical images using VLMs and
GPT-4 generated descriptors is a viable approach. However, accurate
classification requires to exclude certain descriptors from the calculations of
the classification scores. Moreover, we assess the ability of VLMs to evaluate
shape features in breast mass ultrasound images. We further investigate the
degree of variability among the sets of text descriptors produced by GPT-4. Our
work provides several important insights about the application of VLMs for

<p class="mathjax">Fake products are items that are marketed and sold as genuine, high-quality
products but are counterfeit or low-quality knockoffs. These products are often
designed to closely mimic the appearance and branding of the genuine product to
deceive consumers into thinking they are purchasing the real thing. Fake
products can range from clothing and accessories to electronics and other goods
and can be found in a variety of settings, including online marketplaces and
brick-and-mortar stores. Blockchain technology can be used to help detect fake
products in a few different ways. One of the most common ways is through the
use of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of
the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of
code. This allows for a high level of transparency and traceability in supply
chain transactions, making it easier to identify and prevent the sale of fake
products and the use of unique product identifiers, such as serial numbers or
QR codes, that are recorded on the blockchain. This allows consumers to easily
verify the authenticity of a product by scanning the code and checking it
against the information recorded on the blockchain. In this study, we will use
smart contracts to detect fake products and will evaluate based on Gas cost and
ethers used for each implementation.

<p class="mathjax">Aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs) is of great significance to
improve the overall operational efficiency of smart grid. The aggregation model
needs to consider various factors such as network constraints, operational
constraints, and economic characteristics of the DERs. This paper constructs a
multi-slot DER aggregation model that considers the above factors using
feasible region projection approach, which achieved the protection of DERs data
information and the elimination of internal variables. A system economic
dispatch (ED) model is established for the operators to make full use of the
DER clusters. We calculate the feasible regions with temporal coupling by
extending the Progressive Vertex Enumeration (PVE) algorithm to high dimension
by the Quickhull algorithm. Finally, an IEEE 39-bus distribution network is
simulated with DERs to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results
show that the two-step ED derives the same results as the centralized ED.

<p class="mathjax">Image retrieval targets to find images from a database that are visually
similar to the query image. Two-stage methods following retrieve-and-rerank
paradigm have achieved excellent performance, but their separate local and
global modules are inefficient to real-world applications. To better trade-off
retrieval efficiency and accuracy, some approaches fuse global and local
feature into a joint representation to perform single-stage image retrieval.
However, they are still challenging due to various situations to tackle,
$e.g.$, background, occlusion and viewpoint. In this work, we design a
Coarse-to-Fine framework to learn Compact Discriminative representation (CFCD)
for end-to-end single-stage image retrieval-requiring only image-level labels.
Specifically, we first design a novel adaptive softmax-based loss which
dynamically tunes its scale and margin within each mini-batch and increases
them progressively to strengthen supervision during training and intra-class
compactness. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism which attentively selects
prominent local descriptors and infuse fine-grained semantic relations into the
global representation by a hard negative sampling strategy to optimize
inter-class distinctiveness at a global scale. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, which achieves
state-of-the-art single-stage image retrieval performance on benchmarks such as
Revisited Oxford and Revisited Paris. Code is available at
https://github.com/bassyess/CFCD.

<p class="mathjax">A safe controller for multicopter is proposed using control barrier function.
Multicopter dynamics are reformulated to deal with mixed-relative-degree and
non-strict-feedback-form dynamics, and a time-varying safe backstepping
controller is designed. Despite the time-varying variation, it is proven that
the control input can be obtained by solving quadratic programming with affine
inequality constraints. The proposed controller does not utilize a cascade
control system design, unlike existing studies on the safe control of
multicopter. Various safety constraints on angular velocity, total thrust
direction, velocity, and position can be considered. Numerical simulation
results support that the proposed safe controller does not violate all safety
constraints including low- and high-level dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating causal effects from observational network data is a significant
but challenging problem. Existing works in causal inference for observational
network data lack an analysis of the generalization bound, which can
theoretically provide support for alleviating the complex confounding bias and
practically guide the design of learning objectives in a principled manner. To
fill this gap, we derive a generalization bound for causal effect estimation in
network scenarios by exploiting 1) the reweighting schema based on joint
propensity score and 2) the representation learning schema based on Integral
Probability Metric (IPM). We provide two perspectives on the generalization
bound in terms of reweighting and representation learning, respectively.
Motivated by the analysis of the bound, we propose a weighting regression
method based on the joint propensity score augmented with representation
learning. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world networks with
semi-synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the problem of distributed target tracking via
underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) with fading channels. The
degradation of signal quality due to wireless channel fading can significantly
impact network reliability and subsequently reduce the tracking accuracy. To
address this issue, we propose a modified distributed unscented Kalman filter
(DUKF) named DUKF-Fc, which takes into account the effects of measurement
fluctuation and transmission failure induced by channel fading. The channel
estimation error is also considered when designing the estimator and a
sufficient condition is established to ensure the stochastic boundedness of the
estimation error. The proposed filtering scheme is versatile and possesses wide
applicability to numerous real-world scenarios, e.g., tracking a maneuvering
underwater target with acoustic sensors. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed filtering algorithm. In addition, considering the
constraints of network energy resources, the issue of investigating a trade-off
between tracking performance and energy consumption is discussed accordingly.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) are routinely pre-trained on billions of tokens,
only to restart the process over again once new data becomes available. A much
cheaper and more efficient solution would be to enable the continual
pre-training of these models, i.e. updating pre-trained models with new data
instead of re-training them from scratch. However, the distribution shift
induced by novel data typically results in degraded performance on past data.
Taking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in this work, we
examine the effect of different warm-up strategies. Our hypothesis is that the
learning rate must be re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training
on a new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained on the Pile
(upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to pre-train on SlimPajama
(downstream data, 297B tokens), following a linear warmup and cosine decay
schedule. We conduct all experiments on the Pythia 410M language model
architecture and evaluate performance through validation perplexity. We
experiment with different pre-training checkpoints, various maximum learning
rates, and various warmup lengths. Our results show that while rewarming models
first increases the loss on upstream and downstream data, in the longer run it
improves the downstream performance, outperforming models trained from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$even for a large downstream dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen compositions
with prior knowledge of known primitives (attribute and object). Previous works
for CZSL often suffer from grasping the contextuality between attribute and
object, as well as the discriminability of visual features, and the long-tailed
distribution of real-world compositional data. We propose a simple and scalable
framework called Composition Transformer (CoT) to address these issues. CoT
employs object and attribute experts in distinctive manners to generate
representative embeddings, using the visual network hierarchically. The object
expert extracts representative object embeddings from the final layer in a
bottom-up manner, while the attribute expert makes attribute embeddings in a
top-down manner with a proposed object-guided attention module that models
contextuality explicitly. To remedy biased prediction caused by imbalanced data
distribution, we develop a simple minority attribute augmentation (MAA) that
synthesizes virtual samples by mixing two images and oversampling minority
attribute classes. Our method achieves SoTA performance on several benchmarks,
including MIT-States, C-GQA, and VAW-CZSL. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoT in improving visual discrimination and addressing the
model bias from the imbalanced data distribution. The code is available at
https://github.com/HanjaeKim98/CoT.

<p class="mathjax">Group recommendation provides personalized recommendations to a group of
users based on their shared interests, preferences, and characteristics.
Current studies have explored different methods for integrating individual
preferences and making collective decisions that benefit the group as a whole.
However, most of them heavily rely on users with rich behavior and ignore
latent preferences of users with relatively sparse behavior, leading to
insufficient learning of individual interests. To address this challenge, we
present the Multi-Granularity Attention Model (MGAM), a novel approach that
utilizes multiple levels of granularity (i.e., subsets, groups, and supersets)
to uncover group members' latent preferences and mitigate recommendation noise.
Specially, we propose a Subset Preference Extraction module that enhances the
representation of users' latent subset-level preferences by incorporating their
previous interactions with items and utilizing a hierarchical mechanism.
Additionally, our method introduces a Group Preference Extraction module and a
Superset Preference Extraction module, which explore users' latent preferences
on two levels: the group-level, which maintains users' original preferences,
and the superset-level, which includes group-group exterior information. By
incorporating the subset-level embedding, group-level embedding, and
superset-level embedding, our proposed method effectively reduces group
recommendation noise across multiple granularities and comprehensively learns
individual interests. Extensive offline and online experiments have
demonstrated the superiority of our method in terms of performance.

<p class="mathjax">Online Food Recommendation Service (OFRS) has remarkable spatiotemporal
characteristics and the advantage of being able to conveniently satisfy users'
needs in a timely manner. There have been a variety of studies that have begun
to explore its spatiotemporal properties, but a comprehensive and in-depth
analysis of the OFRS spatiotemporal features is yet to be conducted. Therefore,
this paper studies the OFRS based on three questions: how spatiotemporal
features play a role; why self-attention cannot be used to model the
spatiotemporal sequences of OFRS; and how to combine spatiotemporal features to
improve the efficiency of OFRS. Firstly, through experimental analysis, we
systemically extracted the spatiotemporal features of OFRS, identified the most
valuable features and designed an effective combination method. Secondly, we
conducted a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal sequences, which revealed
the shortcomings of self-attention in OFRS, and proposed a more optimized
spatiotemporal sequence method for replacing self-attention. In addition, we
also designed a Dynamic Context Adaptation Model to further improve the
efficiency and performance of OFRS. Through the offline experiments on two
large datasets and online experiments for a week, the feasibility and
superiority of our model were proven.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning based medical image recognition systems often require a
substantial amount of training data with expert annotations, which can be
expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Recently, synthetic augmentation
techniques have been proposed to mitigate the issue by generating realistic
images conditioned on class labels. However, the effectiveness of these methods
heavily depends on the representation capability of the trained generative
model, which cannot be guaranteed without sufficient labeled training data. To
further reduce the dependency on annotated data, we propose a synthetic
augmentation method called HistoDiffusion, which can be pre-trained on
large-scale unlabeled datasets and later applied to a small-scale labeled
dataset for augmented training. In particular, we train a latent diffusion
model (LDM) on diverse unlabeled datasets to learn common features and generate
realistic images without conditional inputs. Then, we fine-tune the model with
classifier guidance in latent space on an unseen labeled dataset so that the
model can synthesize images of specific categories. Additionally, we adopt a
selective mechanism to only add synthetic samples with high confidence of
matching to target labels. We evaluate our proposed method by pre-training on
three histopathology datasets and testing on a histopathology dataset of
colorectal cancer (CRC) excluded from the pre-training datasets. With
HistoDiffusion augmentation, the classification accuracy of a backbone
classifier is remarkably improved by 6.4% using a small set of the original
labels. Our code is available at https://github.com/karenyyy/HistoDiffAug.

<p class="mathjax">Music streaming services are increasingly popular among younger generations
who seek social experiences through personal expression and sharing of
subjective feelings in comments. However, such emotional aspects are often
ignored by current platforms, which affects the listeners' ability to find
music that triggers specific personal feelings. To address this gap, this study
proposes a novel approach that leverages deep learning methods to capture
contextual keywords, sentiments, and induced mechanisms from song comments. The
study augments a current music app with two features, including the
presentation of tags that best represent song comments and a novel map metaphor
that reorganizes song comments based on chronological order, content, and
sentiment. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a
usage scenario and a user study that demonstrate its capability to improve the
user experience of exploring songs and browsing comments of interest. This
study contributes to the advancement of music streaming services by providing a
more personalized and emotionally rich music experience for younger
generations.

<p class="mathjax">We demonstrate equivalence between the reinforcement learning problem and the
supervised classification problem. We consequently equate the exploration
exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning to the dataset imbalance
problem in supervised classification, and find similarities in how they are
addressed. From our analysis of the aforementioned problems we derive a novel
loss function for reinforcement learning and supervised classification. Scope
Loss, our new loss function, adjusts gradients to prevent performance losses
from over-exploitation and dataset imbalances, without the need for any tuning.
We test Scope Loss against SOTA loss functions over a basket of benchmark
reinforcement learning tasks and a skewed classification dataset, and show that
Scope Loss outperforms other loss functions.

<p class="mathjax">Despite significant progress, speech emotion recognition (SER) remains
challenging due to inherent complexity and ambiguity of the emotion attribute,
particularly in wild world. Whereas current studies primarily focus on
recognition and generalization capabilities, this work pioneers an exploration
into the reliability of SER methods and investigates how to model the speech
emotion from the aspect of data distribution across various speech attributes.
Specifically, we first build a novel CNN-based SER model which adopts additive
margin softmax loss to expand the distance between features of different
classes, thereby enhancing their discrimination. Second, a novel multiple
speech attribute control method MSAC is proposed to explicitly control speech
attributes, enabling the model to be less affected by emotion-agnostic
attributes and capture more fine-grained emotion-related features. Third, we
make a first attempt to test and analyze the reliability of the proposed SER
workflow using the out-of-distribution detection method. Extensive experiments
on both single and cross-corpus SER scenarios show that our proposed unified
SER workflow consistently outperforms the baseline in terms of recognition,
generalization, and reliability performance. Besides, in single-corpus SER, the
proposed SER workflow achieves superior recognition results with a WAR of
72.97\% and a UAR of 71.76\% on the IEMOCAP corpus.

<p class="mathjax">With ChatGPT-like large language models (LLM) prevailing in the community,
how to evaluate the ability of LLMs is an open question. Existing evaluation
methods suffer from following shortcomings: (1) constrained evaluation
abilities, (2) vulnerable benchmarks, (3) unobjective metrics. We suggest that
task-based evaluation, where LLM agents complete tasks in a simulated
environment, is a one-for-all solution to solve above problems. We present
AgentSims, an easy-to-use infrastructure for researchers from all disciplines
to test the specific capacities they are interested in. Researchers can build
their evaluation tasks by adding agents and buildings on an interactive GUI or
deploy and test new support mechanisms, i.e. memory, planning and tool-use
systems, by a few lines of codes. Our demo is available at

<p class="mathjax">Question answering is a task that answers factoid questions using a large
collection of documents. It aims to provide precise answers in response to the
user's questions in natural language. Question answering relies on efficient
passage retrieval to select candidate contexts, where traditional sparse vector
space models, such as TF-IDF or BM25, are the de facto method. On the web,
there is no single article that could provide all the possible answers
available on the internet to the question of the problem asked by the user. The
existing Dense Passage Retrieval model has been trained on Wikipedia dump from
Dec. 20, 2018, as the source documents for answering questions. Question
answering (QA) has made big strides with several open-domain and machine
comprehension systems built using large-scale annotated datasets. However, in
the clinical domain, this problem remains relatively unexplored. According to
multiple surveys, Biomedical Questions cannot be answered correctly from
Wikipedia Articles. In this work, we work on the existing DPR framework for the
biomedical domain and retrieve answers from the Pubmed articles which is a
reliable source to answer medical questions. When evaluated on a BioASQ QA
dataset, our fine-tuned dense retriever results in a 0.81 F1 score.

presents many challenges, including high pressure, limited visibility, and
harsh conditions that can damage equipment. Real-world experimentation can be
expensive and difficult to execute. Therefore, it is essential to simulate the
performance of underwater robots in comparable environments to ensure their
optimal functionality within practical real-world contexts.\textit{OysterSim}
generates photo-realistic images and segmentation masks of objects in marine
environments, providing valuable training data for underwater computer vision
applications. By integrating ChatGPT into underwater simulations, users can
convey their thoughts effortlessly and intuitively create desired underwater

substantial time and cost savings by evaluating their algorithms across diverse
underwater conditions in the simulation.} The objective of \textit{ChatSim} is
to integrate Large Language Models (LLM) with a simulation
environment~(\textit{OysterSim}), enabling direct control of the simulated
environment via natural language input. This advancement can greatly enhance
the capabilities of underwater simulation, with far-reaching benefits for

<p class="mathjax">Attacks against industrial control systems (ICSs) often exploit the
insufficiency of authentication mechanisms. Verifying whether the received
messages are intact and issued by legitimate sources can prevent malicious
data/command injection by illegitimate or compromised devices. However, the key
challenge is to introduce message authentication for various ICS communication
models, including multicast or broadcast, with a messaging rate that can be as
high as thousands of messages per second, within very stringent latency
constraints. For example, certain commands for protection in smart grids must
be delivered within 2 milliseconds, ruling out public-key cryptography. This
paper proposes two lightweight message authentication schemes, named CMA and
its multicast variant CMMA, that perform precomputation and caching to
authenticate future messages. With minimal precomputation and communication
overhead, C(M)MA eliminates all cryptographic operations for the source after
the message is given, and all expensive cryptographic operations for the
destinations after the message is received. C(M)MA considers the urgency
profile (or likelihood) of a set of future messages for even faster
verification of the most time-critical (or likely) messages. We demonstrate the
feasibility of C(M)MA in an ICS setting based on a substation automation system
in smart grids.

<p class="mathjax">Surgical tool presence detection is an important part of the intra-operative
and post-operative analysis of a surgery. State-of-the-art models, which
perform this task well on a particular dataset, however, perform poorly when
tested on another dataset. This occurs due to a significant domain shift
between the datasets resulting from the use of different tools, sensors, data
resolution etc. In this paper, we highlight this domain shift in the commonly
performed cataract surgery and propose a novel end-to-end Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation (UDA) method called the Barlow Adaptor that addresses the problem of
distribution shift without requiring any labels from another domain. In
addition, we introduce a novel loss called the Barlow Feature Alignment Loss
(BFAL) which aligns features across different domains while reducing redundancy
and the need for higher batch sizes, thus improving cross-dataset performance.
The use of BFAL is a novel approach to address the challenge of domain shift in
cataract surgery data. Extensive experiments are conducted on two cataract
surgery datasets and it is shown that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art UDA methods by 6%. The code can be found at

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we present NR-SLAM, a novel non-rigid monocular SLAM system
founded on the combination of a Dynamic Deformation Graph with a Visco-Elastic
deformation model. The former enables our system to represent the dynamics of
the deforming environment as the camera explores, while the later allows us to
model general deformations in a simple way. The presented system is able to
automatically initialize and extend a map modeled by a sparse point cloud in
deforming environments, that is refined with a sliding-window Deformable Bundle
Adjustment. This map serves as base for the estimation of the camera motion and
deformation and enables us to represent arbitrary surface topologies,
overcoming the limitations of previous methods. To assess the performance of
our system in challenging deforming scenarios, we evaluate it in several

<p class="mathjax">Text Classification is the process of categorizing text into the relevant
categories and its algorithms are at the core of many Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and NLP
are the most highly used information retrieval methods in text classification.
We have investigated and analyzed the feature weighting method for text
classification on unstructured data. The proposed model considered two features
N-Grams and TF-IDF on the IMDB movie reviews and Amazon Alexa reviews dataset
for sentiment analysis. Then we have used the state-of-the-art classifier to
validate the method i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression,
Multinomial Naive Bayes (Multinomial NB), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and
k-nearest neighbors (KNN). From those two feature extractions, a significant
increase in feature extraction with TF-IDF features rather than based on
N-Gram. TF-IDF got the maximum accuracy (93.81%), precision (94.20%), recall
(93.81%), and F1-score (91.99%) value in Random Forest classifier.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel image registration method based on implicit neural
representations that addresses the challenging problem of registering a pair of
brain images with similar anatomical structures, but where one image contains
additional features or artifacts that are not present in the other image. To
demonstrate its effectiveness, we use 2D microscopy $\textit{in situ}$
hybridization gene expression images of the marmoset brain. Accurately
quantifying gene expression requires image registration to a brain template,
which is difficult due to the diversity of patterns causing variations in
visible anatomical brain structures. Our approach uses implicit networks in
combination with an image exclusion loss to jointly perform the registration
and decompose the image into a support and residual image. The support image
aligns well with the template, while the residual image captures individual
image characteristics that diverge from the template. In experiments, our
method provided excellent results and outperformed other registration
techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Creating an animated data video enriched with audio narration takes a
significant amount of time and effort and requires expertise. Users not only
need to design complex animations, but also turn written text scripts into
audio narrations and synchronize visual changes with the narrations. This paper
presents WonderFlow, an interactive authoring tool, that facilitates
narration-centric design of animated data videos. WonderFlow allows authors to
easily specify a semantic link between text and the corresponding chart
elements. Then it automatically generates audio narration by leveraging
text-to-speech techniques and aligns the narration with an animation.
WonderFlow provides a visualization structure-aware animation library designed
to ease chart animation creation, enabling authors to apply pre-designed
animation effects to common visualization components. It also allows authors to
preview and iteratively refine their data videos in a unified system, without
having to switch between different creation tools. To evaluate WonderFlow's
effectiveness and usability, we created an example gallery and conducted a user
study and expert interviews. The results demonstrated that WonderFlow is easy
to use and simplifies the creation of data videos with narration-animation
interplay.

<p class="mathjax">Automatically generating regular expressions (abbrev. regexes) from natural
language description (NL2RE) has been an emerging research area. Prior studies
treat regex as a linear sequence of tokens and generate the final expressions
autoregressively in a single pass. They did not take into account the
step-by-step internal text-matching processes behind the final results. This
significantly hinders the efficacy and interpretability of regex generation by
neural language models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called InfeRE,
which decomposes the generation of regexes into chains of step-by-step
inference. To enhance the robustness, we introduce a self-consistency decoding
mechanism that ensembles multiple outputs sampled from different models. We
evaluate InfeRE on two publicly available datasets, NL-RX-Turk and KB13, and
compare the results with state-of-the-art approaches and the popular tree-based
generation approach TRANX. Experimental results show that InfeRE substantially
outperforms previous baselines, yielding 16.3% and 14.7% improvement in DFA@5
accuracy on two datasets, respectively. Particularly, InfeRE outperforms the
popular tree-based generation approach by 18.1% and 11.3% on both datasets,
respectively, in terms of DFA@5 accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">DAVIS camera, streaming two complementary sensing modalities of asynchronous
events and frames, has gradually been used to address major object detection
challenges (e.g., fast motion blur and low-light). However, how to effectively
leverage rich temporal cues and fuse two heterogeneous visual streams remains a
challenging endeavor. To address this challenge, we propose a novel streaming
object detector with Transformer, namely SODFormer, which first integrates
events and frames to continuously detect objects in an asynchronous manner.
Technically, we first build a large-scale multimodal neuromorphic object
detection dataset (i.e., PKU-DAVIS-SOD) over 1080.1k manual labels. Then, we
design a spatiotemporal Transformer architecture to detect objects via an
end-to-end sequence prediction problem, where the novel temporal Transformer
module leverages rich temporal cues from two visual streams to improve the
detection performance. Finally, an asynchronous attention-based fusion module
is proposed to integrate two heterogeneous sensing modalities and take
complementary advantages from each end, which can be queried at any time to
locate objects and break through the limited output frequency from synchronized
frame-based fusion strategies. The results show that the proposed SODFormer
outperforms four state-of-the-art methods and our eight baselines by a
significant margin. We also show that our unifying framework works well even in
cases where the conventional frame-based camera fails, e.g., high-speed motion
and low-light conditions. Our dataset and code can be available at
https://github.com/dianzl/SODFormer.

<p class="mathjax">The five-dollar model is a lightweight text-to-image generative architecture
that generates low dimensional images from an encoded text prompt. This model
can successfully generate accurate and aesthetically pleasing content in low
dimensional domains, with limited amounts of training data. Despite the small
size of both the model and datasets, the generated images are still able to
maintain the encoded semantic meaning of the textual prompt. We apply this
model to three small datasets: pixel art video game maps, video game sprite
images, and down-scaled emoji images and apply novel augmentation strategies to
improve the performance of our model on these limited datasets. We evaluate our
models performance using cosine similarity score between text-image pairs
generated by the CLIP VIT-B/32 model.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR-based 3D detection plays a vital role in autonomous navigation.
Surprisingly, although autonomous vehicles (AVs) must detect both near-field
objects (for collision avoidance) and far-field objects (for longer-term
planning), contemporary benchmarks focus only on near-field 3D detection.
However, AVs must detect far-field objects for safe navigation. In this paper,
we present an empirical analysis of far-field 3D detection using the long-range
detection dataset Argoverse 2.0 to better understand the problem, and share the
following insight: near-field LiDAR measurements are dense and optimally
encoded by small voxels, while far-field measurements are sparse and are better
encoded with large voxels. We exploit this observation to build a collection of
range experts tuned for near-vs-far field detection, and propose simple
techniques to efficiently ensemble models for long-range detection that improve
efficiency by 33% and boost accuracy by 3.2% CDS.

<p class="mathjax">Many creative writing tasks (e.g., fiction writing) require authors to write
complex narrative components (e.g., characterization, events, dialogue) over
the course of a long story. Similarly, literary scholars need to manually
annotate and interpret texts to understand such abstract components. In this
paper, we explore how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and interactive
visualization can help writers and scholars in such scenarios. To this end, we
present Portrayal, an interactive visualization system for analyzing characters
in a story. Portrayal extracts natural language indicators from a text to
capture the characterization process and then visualizes the indicators in an
interactive interface. We evaluated the system with 12 creative writers and
scholars in a one-week-long qualitative study. Our findings suggest Portrayal
helped writers revise their drafts and create dynamic characters and scenes. It
helped scholars analyze characters without the need for any manual annotation,
and design literary arguments with concrete evidence.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial robustness is a research area that has recently received a lot of
attention in the quest for trustworthy artificial intelligence. However, recent
works on adversarial robustness have focused on supervised learning where it is
assumed that labeled data is plentiful. In this paper, we investigate
semi-supervised adversarial training where labeled data is scarce. We derive
two upper bounds for the robust risk and propose a regularization term for
unlabeled data motivated by these two upper bounds. Then, we develop a
semi-supervised adversarial training algorithm that combines the proposed
regularization term with knowledge distillation using a semi-supervised teacher
(i.e., a teacher model trained using a semi-supervised learning algorithm). Our
experiments show that our proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significant margins compared to existing algorithms. In
particular, compared to supervised learning algorithms, performance of our
proposed algorithm is not much worse even when the amount of labeled data is
very small. For example, our algorithm with only 8\% labeled data is comparable
to supervised adversarial training algorithms that use all labeled data, both
in terms of standard and robust accuracies on CIFAR-10.

<p class="mathjax">High-order implicit shock tracking (fitting) is a class of high-order,
optimization-based numerical methods to approximate solutions of conservation
laws with non-smooth features by aligning elements of the computational mesh
with non-smooth features. This ensures the non-smooth features are perfectly
represented by inter-element jumps and high-order basis functions approximate
smooth regions of the solution without nonlinear stabilization, which leads to
accurate approximations on traditionally coarse meshes. In this work, we extend
implicit shock tracking to time-dependent problems using a slab-based
space-time approach. This is achieved by reformulating a time-dependent
conservation law as a steady conservation law in one higher dimension and
applying existing implicit shock tracking techniques. To avoid computations
over the entire time domain and unstructured mesh generation in higher
dimensions, we introduce a general procedure to generate conforming,
simplex-only meshes of space-time slabs in such a way that preserves features
(e.g., curved elements, refinement regions) from previous time slabs. The use
of space-time slabs also simplifies the shock tracking problem by reducing
temporal complexity. Several practical adaptations of the implicit shock
tracking solvers are developed for the space-time setting including 1) a
self-adjusting temporal boundary, 2) nondimensionalization of a space-time
slab, 3) adaptive mesh refinement, and 4) shock boundary conditions, which lead
to accurate solutions on coarse space-time grids, even for problem with complex
flow features such as curved shocks, shock formation, shock-shock and
shock-boundary interaction, and triple points.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal recommendation systems, which integrate diverse types of
information, have gained widespread attention in recent years. However,
compared to traditional collaborative filtering-based multi-modal
recommendation systems, research on multi-modal sequential recommendation is
still in its nascent stages. Unlike traditional sequential recommendation
models that solely rely on item identifier (ID) information and focus on
network structure design, multi-modal recommendation models need to emphasize
item representation learning and the fusion of heterogeneous data sources. This
paper investigates the impact of item representation learning on downstream
recommendation tasks and examines the disparities in information fusion at
different stages. Empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the need
to design a framework suitable for collaborative learning and fusion of diverse
information. Based on this, we propose a new model-agnostic framework for
multi-modal sequential recommendation tasks, called Online
Distillation-enhanced Multi-modal Transformer (ODMT), to enhance feature
interaction and mutual learning among multi-source input (ID, text, and image),
while avoiding conflicts among different features during training, thereby
improving recommendation accuracy. To be specific, we first introduce an
ID-aware Multi-modal Transformer module in the item representation learning
stage to facilitate information interaction among different features. Secondly,
we employ an online distillation training strategy in the prediction
optimization stage to make multi-source data learn from each other and improve
prediction robustness. Experimental results on a video content recommendation
dataset and three e-commerce recommendation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed two modules, which is approximately 10%
improvement in performance compared to baseline models.

<p class="mathjax">Developing a generalized segmentation model capable of simultaneously
delineating multiple organs and diseases is highly desirable. Federated
learning (FL) is a key technology enabling the collaborative development of a
model without exchanging training data. However, the limited access to fully
annotated training data poses a major challenge to training generalizable
models. We propose "ConDistFL", a framework to solve this problem by combining
FL with knowledge distillation. Local models can extract the knowledge of
unlabeled organs and tumors from partially annotated data from the global model
with an adequately designed conditional probability representation. We validate
our framework on four distinct partially annotated abdominal CT datasets from
the MSD and KiTS19 challenges. The experimental results show that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms FedAvg and FedOpt baselines. Moreover, the
performance on an external test dataset demonstrates superior generalizability
compared to models trained on each dataset separately. Our ablation study
suggests that ConDistFL can perform well without frequent aggregation, reducing
the communication cost of FL. Our implementation will be available at
https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/dev/research/condist-fl.

<p class="mathjax">Motion planning can be cast as a trajectory optimisation problem where a cost
is minimised as a function of the trajectory being generated. In complex
environments with several obstacles and complicated geometry, this optimisation
problem is usually difficult to solve and prone to local minima. However,
recent advancements in computing hardware allow for parallel trajectory
optimisation where multiple solutions are obtained simultaneously, each
initialised from a different starting point. Unfortunately, without a strategy
preventing two solutions to collapse on each other, naive parallel optimisation
can suffer from mode collapse diminishing the efficiency of the approach and
the likelihood of finding a global solution. In this paper we leverage on
recent advances in the theory of rough paths to devise an algorithm for
parallel trajectory optimisation that promotes diversity over the range of
solutions, therefore avoiding mode collapses and achieving better global
properties. Our approach builds on path signatures and Hilbert space
representations of trajectories, and connects parallel variational inference
for trajectory estimation with diversity promoting kernels. We empirically
demonstrate that this strategy achieves lower average costs than competing
alternatives on a range of problems, from 2D navigation to robotic manipulators
operating in cluttered environments.

<p class="mathjax">Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are known to suffer from
optimization difficulty. In this work, we reveal the connection between the
optimization difficulty of PINNs and activation functions. Specifically, we
show that PINNs exhibit high sensitivity to activation functions when solving
PDEs with distinct properties. Existing works usually choose activation
functions by inefficient trial-and-error. To avoid the inefficient manual
selection and to alleviate the optimization difficulty of PINNs, we introduce
adaptive activation functions to search for the optimal function when solving
different problems. We compare different adaptive activation functions and
discuss their limitations in the context of PINNs. Furthermore, we propose to
tailor the idea of learning combinations of candidate activation functions to
the PINNs optimization, which has a higher requirement for the smoothness and
diversity on learned functions. This is achieved by removing activation
functions which cannot provide higher-order derivatives from the candidate set
and incorporating elementary functions with different properties according to
our prior knowledge about the PDE at hand. We further enhance the search space
with adaptive slopes. The proposed adaptive activation function can be used to
solve different PDE systems in an interpretable way. Its effectiveness is
demonstrated on a series of benchmarks. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing interacting hands from monocular RGB data is a challenging
task, as it involves many interfering factors, e.g. self- and mutual occlusion
and similar textures. Previous works only leverage information from a single
RGB image without modeling their physically plausible relation, which leads to
inferior reconstruction results. In this work, we are dedicated to explicitly
exploiting spatial-temporal information to achieve better interacting hand
reconstruction. On one hand, we leverage temporal context to complement
insufficient information provided by the single frame, and design a novel
temporal framework with a temporal constraint for interacting hand motion
smoothness. On the other hand, we further propose an interpenetration detection
module to produce kinetically plausible interacting hands without physical
collisions. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness
of our proposed framework, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks.

only analyze data for insights but also craft a cohesive narrative that
effectively communicates the insights. Text generation capabilities of
contemporary large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to assist the
authoring of data-driven articles and expedite the writing process. In this
work, we investigate the feasibility and perceived value of leveraging LLMs to
support authors of data-driven articles. We designed a prototype system,
DataTales, that leverages a LLM to generate textual narratives accompanying a

<p class="mathjax">Federated optimization, an emerging paradigm which finds wide real-world
applications such as federated learning, enables multiple clients (e.g., edge
devices) to collaboratively optimize a global function. The clients do not
share their local datasets and typically only share their local gradients.
However, the gradient information is not available in many applications of
federated optimization, which hence gives rise to the paradigm of federated
zeroth-order optimization (ZOO). Existing federated ZOO algorithms suffer from
the limitations of query and communication inefficiency, which can be
attributed to (a) their reliance on a substantial number of function queries
for gradient estimation and (b) the significant disparity between their
realized local updates and the intended global updates. To this end, we (a)
introduce trajectory-informed gradient surrogates which is able to use the
history of function queries during optimization for accurate and
query-efficient gradient estimation, and (b) develop the technique of adaptive
gradient correction using these gradient surrogates to mitigate the
aforementioned disparity. Based on these, we propose the federated zeroth-order
optimization using trajectory-informed surrogate gradients (FZooS) algorithm
for query- and communication-efficient federated ZOO. Our FZooS achieves
theoretical improvements over the existing approaches, which is supported by
our real-world experiments such as federated black-box adversarial attack and
federated non-differentiable metric optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of
scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual
quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render,
while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For
unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p
resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We
introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual
quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow
high-quality real-time (&gt;= 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution.
First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we
represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of
continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding
unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved
optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing
anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene;
Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports
anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime
rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time
rendering on several established datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Nakamoto's consensus protocol works in a permissionless model and tolerates
Byzantine failures, but only offers probabilistic agreement. Recently, the
Sandglass protocol has shown such weaker guarantees are not a necessary
consequence of a permissionless model; yet, Sandglass only tolerates benign
failures, and operates in an unconventional partially synchronous model. We
present Gorilla Sandglass, the first Byzantine tolerant consensus protocol to
guarantee, in the same synchronous model adopted by Nakamoto, deterministic
agreement and termination with probability 1 in a permissionless setting. We
prove the correctness of Gorilla by mapping executions that would violate
agreement or termination in Gorilla to executions in Sandglass, where we know
such violations are impossible. Establishing termination proves particularly
interesting, as the mapping requires reasoning about infinite executions and
their probabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential recommendation is one of the most important tasks in recommender
systems, which aims to recommend the next interacted item with historical
behaviors as input. Traditional sequential recommendation always mainly
considers the collected positive feedback such as click, purchase, etc.
However, in short-video platforms such as TikTok, video viewing behavior may
not always represent positive feedback. Specifically, the videos are played
automatically, and users passively receive the recommended videos. In this new
scenario, users passively express negative feedback by skipping over videos
they do not like, which provides valuable information about their preferences.
Different from the negative feedback studied in traditional recommender
systems, this passive-negative feedback can reflect users' interests and serve
as an important supervision signal in extracting users' preferences. Therefore,
it is essential to carefully design and utilize it in this novel recommendation
scenario. In this work, we first conduct analyses based on a large-scale
real-world short-video behavior dataset and illustrate the significance of
leveraging passive feedback. We then propose a novel method that deploys the
sub-interest encoder, which incorporates positive feedback and passive-negative
feedback as supervision signals to learn the user's current active
sub-interest. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive fusion layer to integrate
various sub-interests effectively. To enhance the robustness of our model, we
then introduce a multi-task learning module to simultaneously optimize two
kinds of feedback -- passive-negative feedback and traditional randomly-sampled
negative feedback. The experiments on two large-scale datasets verify that the
proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches. The
code is released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/RecSys2023-SINE.

in mind, we first devise a zeroing control barrier function (ZCBF) using a
newly proposed nominal evading maneuver. By designing the nominal evading
maneuver to 1) be continuously differentiable, 2) satisfy input constraints,
and 3) be capable of handling other state constraints, we deduce an ultimate
invariant set, a subset of the safe set that can be rendered forward invariant
with admissible control inputs. Thanks to the development of the ultimate
invariant set, we then propose a safety-critical controller, which is a
computationally tractable one-step model predictive controller (MPC) with
guaranteed recursive feasibility. We validate the proposed framework in
simulation, where a fixed-wing UAV tracks a circular trajectory while
satisfying multiple safety constraints including collision avoidance, bounds on
flight speed and flight path angle, and input constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal hand gesture recognition (HGR) systems can achieve higher
recognition accuracy. However, acquiring multimodal gesture recognition data
typically requires users to wear additional sensors, thereby increasing
hardware costs. This paper proposes a novel generative approach to improve
Surface Electromyography (sEMG)-based HGR accuracy via virtual Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU) signals. Specifically, we trained a deep generative
model based on the intrinsic correlation between forearm sEMG signals and
forearm IMU signals to generate virtual forearm IMU signals from the input
forearm sEMG signals at first. Subsequently, the sEMG signals and virtual IMU
signals were fed into a multimodal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for
gesture recognition. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we
conducted experiments on 6 databases, including 5 publicly available databases
and our collected database comprising 28 subjects performing 38 gestures,
containing both sEMG and IMU data. The results show that our proposed approach
outperforms the sEMG-based unimodal HGR method (with increases of
2.15%-13.10%). It demonstrates that incorporating virtual IMU signals,
generated by deep generative models, can significantly enhance the accuracy of
sEMG-based HGR. The proposed approach represents a successful attempt to
transition from unimodal HGR to multimodal HGR without additional sensor
hardware.

<p class="mathjax">We study pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for the fundamental \emph{0-1
Knapsack} problem. Recent research interest has focused on its fine-grained
complexity with respect to the number of items $n$ and the \emph{maximum item
weight} $w_{\max}$. Under $(\min,+)$-convolution hypothesis, 0-1 Knapsack does
not have $O((n+w_{\max})^{2-\delta})$ time algorithms
(Cygan-Mucha-W\k{e}grzycki-W\l{}odarczyk 2017 and
K\"{u}nnemann-Paturi-Schneider 2017). On the upper bound side, currently the
fastest algorithm runs in $\tilde O(n + w_{\max}^{12/5})$ time (Chen, Lian,
Mao, and Zhang 2023), improving the earlier $O(n + w_{\max}^3)$-time algorithm
by Polak, Rohwedder, and W\k{e}grzycki (2021).
<br />In this paper, we close this gap between the upper bound and the conditional
lower bound (up to subpolynomial factors):
<br />- The 0-1 Knapsack problem has a deterministic algorithm in $O(n +
w_{\max}^{2}\log^4w_{\max})$ time.
<br />Our algorithm combines and extends several recent structural results and
algorithmic techniques from the literature on knapsack-type problems:
<br />- We generalize the "fine-grained proximity" technique of Chen, Lian, Mao,
and Zhang (2023) derived from the additive-combinatorial results of Bringmann
and Wellnitz (2021) on dense subset sums. This allows us to bound the support
size of the useful partial solutions in the dynamic program.
<br />- To exploit the small support size, our main technical component is a vast
extension of the "witness propagation" method, originally designed by Deng,
Mao, and Zhong (2023) for speeding up dynamic programming in the easier
unbounded knapsack settings. To extend this approach to our 0-1 setting, we use
a novel pruning method, as well as the two-level color-coding of Bringmann
(2017) and the SMAWK algorithm on tall matrices.

<p class="mathjax">Quotient regularization models (QRMs) are a class of powerful regularization
techniques that have gained considerable attention in recent years, due to
their ability to handle complex and highly nonlinear data sets. However, the
nonconvex nature of QRM poses a significant challenge in finding its optimal
solution. We are interested in scenarios where both the numerator and the
denominator of QRM are absolutely one-homogeneous functions, which is widely
applicable in the fields of signal processing and image processing. In this
paper, we utilize a gradient flow to minimize such QRM in combination with a
quadratic data fidelity term. Our scheme involves solving a convex problem
iteratively.The convergence analysis is conducted on a modified scheme in a
continuous formulation, showing the convergence to a stationary point.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
in terms of accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art QRM solvers.

<p class="mathjax">After an election, should election officials release an electronic record of
each ballot? The release of such cast vote records could bolster the legitimacy
of the certified result. But it may also facilitate vote revelation, where an
analyst unravels the secret ballot by uniquely linking vote choices on the
anonymous ballot to the voter's name and address in the public voter file. We
provide the first empirical study of the extent of vote revelation under
several possible election-reporting regimes, ranging from precinct-level
results to the individual ballot records known as cast vote records. Using
Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we find that cast vote records could
reveal less than 0.2% of any voters' choices in the 2020 general election.
Perhaps counterintuitively, releasing cast vote records coded by precinct and
vote method are no more revelatory than releasing aggregate vote tallies for
each precinct and vote method. We conclude that cast vote records are
sufficiently privacy-protecting, and suggest how the privacy violations that do
remain could be reduced.

<p class="mathjax">Many evolutionary algorithms (EAs) take advantage of parallel evaluation of
candidates. However, if evaluation times vary significantly, many worker nodes
(i.e.,\ compute clients) are idle much of the time, waiting for the next
generation to be created. Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS), a
class of EAs that optimizes the architecture and hyperparameters of deep neural
networks, is particularly vulnerable to this issue. This paper proposes a
generic asynchronous evaluation strategy (AES) that is then adapted to work
with ENAS. AES increases throughput by maintaining a queue of upto $K$
individuals ready to be sent to the workers for evaluation and proceeding to
the next generation as soon as $M&lt;&lt;K$ individuals have been evaluated by the
workers. A suitable value for $M$ is determined experimentally, balancing
diversity and efficiency. To showcase the generality and power of AES, it was
first evaluated in 11-bit multiplexer design (a single-population verifiable
discovery task) and then scaled up to ENAS for image captioning (a
multi-population open-ended-optimization task). In both problems, a multifold
performance improvement was observed, suggesting that AES is a promising method
for parallelizing the evolution of complex systems with long and variable
evaluation times, such as those in ENAS.

(NLP)-based applications, particularly in the field of literature. However,
existing research on simile detection often relies on corpora that are limited

address this issue, we propose a simile data augmentation method based on
\textbf{W}ord replacement And Sentence completion using the GPT-2 language
model. Our iterative process called I-WAS, is designed to improve the quality
of the augmented sentences. To better evaluate the performance of our method in

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, the intra-day multi-interval rolling-window joint dispatch and
pricing of energy and reserve is studied under increasing volatile and
uncertain renewable generations. A look-ahead energy-reserve co-optimization
model is proposed for the rolling-window dispatch, where possible contingencies
and load/renewable forecast errors over the look-ahead window are modeled as
several scenario trajectories, while generation, especially its ramp, is
jointly scheduled with reserve to minimize the expected system cost considering
these scenarios. Based on the proposed model, marginal prices of energy and
reserve are derived, which incorporate shadow prices of generators' individual
ramping capability limits to eliminate their possible ramping-induced
opportunity costs or arbitrages. We prove that under mild conditions, the
proposed market design provides dispatch-following incentives to generators
without the need for out-of-the-market uplifts, and truthful-bidding incentives
of price-taking generators can be guaranteed as well. Some discussions are also
made on how to fit the proposed framework into current market practice. These
findings are validated in numerical simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the subjective nature of semantic textual similarity (STS) and
pervasive disagreements in STS annotation, existing benchmarks have used
averaged human ratings as the gold standard. Averaging masks the true
distribution of human opinions on examples of low agreement, and prevents
models from capturing the semantic vagueness that the individual ratings
represent. In this work, we introduce USTS, the first Uncertainty-aware STS
dataset with ~15,000 Chinese sentence pairs and 150,000 labels, to study
collective human opinions in STS. Analysis reveals that neither a scalar nor a
single Gaussian fits a set of observed judgements adequately. We further show
that current STS models cannot capture the variance caused by human
disagreement on individual instances, but rather reflect the predictive
confidence over the aggregate dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Kernel fuzzing is important for finding critical kernel vulnerabilities.
Close-source (e.g., Windows) operating system kernel fuzzing is even more
challenging due to the lack of source code. Existing approaches fuzz the kernel
by modeling syscall sequences from traces or static analysis of system codes.
However, a common limitation is that they do not learn and mutate the syscall
sequences to reach different kernel states, which can potentially result in
more bugs or crashes.
<br />In this paper, we propose WinkFuzz, an approach to learn and mutate traced
syscall sequences in order to reach different kernel states. WinkFuzz learns
syscall dependencies from the trace, identifies potential syscalls in the trace
that can have dependent subsequent syscalls, and applies the dependencies to
insert more syscalls while preserving the dependencies into the trace. Then
WinkFuzz fuzzes the synthesized new syscall sequence to find system crashes.
<br />We applied WinkFuzz to four seed applications and found a total increase in
syscall number of 70.8\%, with a success rate of 61\%, within three insert
levels. The average time for tracing, dependency analysis, recovering model
script, and synthesizing script was 600, 39, 34, and 129 seconds respectively.
The instant fuzzing rate is 3742 syscall executions per second. However, the
average fuzz efficiency dropped to 155 syscall executions per second when the
initializing time, waiting time, and other factors were taken into account. We
fuzzed each seed application for 24 seconds and, on average, obtained 12.25
crashes within that time frame.

<p class="mathjax">Color selection plays a critical role in graphic document design and requires
sufficient consideration of various contexts. However, recommending appropriate
colors which harmonize with the other colors and textual contexts in documents
is a challenging task, even for experienced designers. In this study, we
propose a multimodal masked color model that integrates both color and textual
contexts to provide text-aware color recommendation for graphic documents. Our
proposed model comprises self-attention networks to capture the relationships
between colors in multiple palettes, and cross-attention networks that
incorporate both color and CLIP-based text representations. Our proposed method
primarily focuses on color palette completion, which recommends colors based on
the given colors and text. Additionally, it is applicable for another color
recommendation task, full palette generation, which generates a complete color
palette corresponding to the given text. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed approach surpasses previous color palette completion methods on
accuracy, color distribution, and user experience, as well as full palette
generation methods concerning color diversity and similarity to the ground
truth palettes.

<p class="mathjax">Because of the ever-growing amount of wireless consumers, spectrum-sharing
techniques have been increasingly common in the wireless ecosystem, with the
main goal of avoiding harmful interference to coexisting communication systems.
This is even more important when considering systems-such as nautical and
aerial fleet radars-in which incumbent radios operate mission-critical
communication links. To study, develop, and validate these solutions, adequate
platforms, such as the Colosseum wireless network emulator, are key as they
enable experimentation with spectrum-sharing heterogeneous radio technologies
in controlled environments. In this work, we demonstrate how Colosseum can be
used to twin commercial radio waveforms to evaluate the coexistence of such
technologies in complex wireless propagation environments. To this aim, we
create a high-fidelity spectrum-sharing scenario on Colosseum to evaluate the
impact of twinned commercial radar waveforms on a cellular network operating in
the CBRS band. Then, we leverage IQ samples collected on the testbed to train a
machine learning agent that runs at the base station to detect the presence of
incumbent radar transmissions and vacate the bandwidth to avoid causing them
harmful interference. Our results show an average detection accuracy of 88%,
with accuracy above 90% in SNR regimes above 0 dB and SINR regimes above -20
dB, and with an average detection time of 137 ms.

<p class="mathjax">Many cities around the world are aspiring to become. However, smart
initiatives often give little weight to the opinions of average citizens.
<br />Social media are one of the most important sources of citizen opinions. This
paper presents a prototype of a framework for processing social media posts
with municipal decision-making in mind. The framework consists of a sequence of
three steps: (1) determining the sentiment polarity of each social media post
(2) identifying prevalent topics and mapping these topics to individual posts,
and (3) aggregating these two pieces of information into a fuzzy number
representing the overall sentiment expressed towards each topic. Optionally,
the fuzzy number can be reduced into a tuple of two real numbers indicating the
"amount" of positive and negative opinion expressed towards each topic.
<br />The framework is demonstrated on tweets published from Ostrava, Czechia over
a period of about two months. This application illustrates how fuzzy numbers
represent sentiment in a richer way and capture the diversity of opinions
expressed on social media.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel approach for recovering sparse signals using
sorted L1/L2 minimization. The proposed method assigns higher weights to
indices with smaller absolute values and lower weights to larger values,
effectively preserving the most significant contributions to the signal while
promoting sparsity. We present models for both noise-free and noisy scenarios,
and rigorously prove the existence of solutions for each case. To solve these
models, we adopt a linearization approach inspired by the difference of convex
functions algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our method over state-of-the-art approaches in sparse signal recovery across
various circumstances, particularly in support detection.

<p class="mathjax">Currently, the general aim of flocking and formation control laws for
multi-agent systems is to form and maintain a rigid configuration, such as, the
alpha-lattices in flocking control methods, where the desired distance between
each pair of connected agents is fixed. This introduces a scalability issue for
large-scale deployment of agents due to unrealizable geometrical constraints
and the constant need of centralized orchestrator to ensure the formation graph
rigidity. This paper presents a flexible distributed flocking cohesion
algorithm for nonholonomic multi-agent systems. The desired geometry
configuration between each pair of agents is adaptive and flexible. The
distributed flocking goal is achieved using limited information exchange (i.e.,
the local field gradient) between connected neighbor agents and it does not
rely on any other motion variables measurements, such as (relative) position,
velocity, or acceleration. Additionally, the flexible flocking scheme with
safety is considered so that the agents with limited sensing capability are
able to maintain the connectedness of communication topology at all time and
avoid inter-agent collisions. The stability analysis of the proposed methods is
presented along with numerical simulation results to show their effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Quality of Experience~(QoE)-driven adaptive bitrate~(ABR) algorithms are
typically optimized using QoE models that are based on the mean opinion
score~(MOS), while such principles may not account for user heterogeneity on
rating scales, resulting in unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we propose
\texttt{Jade}, which leverages reinforcement learning with human
feedback~(RLHF) technologies to better align the users' opinion scores.
\texttt{Jade}'s rank-based QoE model considers relative values of user ratings
to interpret the subjective perception of video sessions. We implement
linear-based and Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based architectures for satisfying
both accuracy and generalization ability. We further propose entropy-aware
reinforced mechanisms for training policies with the integration of the
proposed QoE models. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{Jade}
performs favorably on conventional metrics, such as quality and stall ratio,
and improves QoE by 8.09\%-38.13\% in different network conditions, emphasizing
the importance of user heterogeneity in QoE modeling and the potential of
combining linear-based and DNN-based models for performance improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Reliable and robust evaluation methods are a necessary first step towards
developing machine learning models that are themselves robust and reliable.
Unfortunately, current evaluation protocols typically used to assess
classifiers fail to comprehensively evaluate performance as they tend to rely
on limited types of test data, and ignore others. For example, using the
standard test data fails to evaluate the predictions made by the classifier to
samples from classes it was not trained on. On the other hand, testing with
data containing samples from unknown classes fails to evaluate how well the
classifier can predict the labels for known classes. This article advocates
bench-marking performance using a wide range of different types of data and
using a single metric that can be applied to all such data types to produce a
consistent evaluation of performance. Using such a benchmark it is found that
current deep neural networks, including those trained with methods that are
believed to produce state-of-the-art robustness, are extremely vulnerable to
making mistakes on certain types of data. This means that such models will be
unreliable in real-world scenarios where they may encounter data from many
different domains, and that they are insecure as they can easily be fooled into
making the wrong decisions. It is hoped that these results will motivate the
wider adoption of more comprehensive testing methods that will, in turn, lead
to the development of more robust machine learning methods in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Prompting is used to guide or steer a language model in generating an
appropriate response that is consistent with the desired outcome. Chaining is a
strategy used to decompose complex tasks into smaller, manageable components.
In this study, we utilize prompt chaining for extensive legal document
classification tasks, which present difficulties due to their intricate
domain-specific language and considerable length. Our approach begins with the
creation of a concise summary of the original document, followed by a semantic
search for related exemplar texts and their corresponding annotations from a
training corpus. Finally, we prompt for a label - based on the task - to
assign, by leveraging the in-context learning from the few-shot prompt. We
demonstrate that through prompt chaining, we can not only enhance the
performance over zero-shot, but also surpass the micro-F1 score achieved by
larger models, such as ChatGPT zero-shot, using smaller models.

<p class="mathjax">Representation learning for images has been advanced by recent progress in
more complex neural models such as the Vision Transformers and new learning
theories such as the structural causal models. However, these models mainly
rely on the classification loss to implicitly regularize the class-level data
distributions, and they may face difficulties when handling classes with
diverse visual patterns. We argue that the incorporation of the structural
information between data samples may improve this situation. To achieve this
goal, this paper presents a framework termed \textbf{C}lass-level Structural
Relation Modeling and Smoothing for Visual Representation Learning (CSRMS),
which includes the Class-level Relation Modelling, Class-aware Graph Sampling,
and Relational Graph-Guided Representation Learning modules to model a
relational graph of the entire dataset and perform class-aware smoothing and
regularization operations to alleviate the issue of intra-class visual
diversity and inter-class similarity. Specifically, the Class-level Relation
Modelling module uses a clustering algorithm to learn the data distributions in
the feature space and identify three types of class-level sample relations for
the training set; Class-aware Graph Sampling module extends typical training
batch construction process with three strategies to sample dataset-level
sub-graphs; and Relational Graph-Guided Representation Learning module employs
a graph convolution network with knowledge-guided smoothing operations to ease
the projection from different visual patterns to the same class. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured knowledge modelling for enhanced
representation learning and show that CSRMS can be incorporated with any
state-of-the-art visual representation learning models for performance gains.

<p class="mathjax">Line attributes such as width and dashing are commonly used to encode
information. However, many questions on the perception of line attributes
remain, such as how many levels of attribute variation can be distinguished or
which line attributes are the preferred choices for which tasks. We conducted
three studies to develop guidelines for using stylized lines to encode scalar
data. In our first study, participants drew stylized lines to encode
uncertainty information. Uncertainty is usually visualized alongside other
data. Therefore, alternative visual channels are important for the
visualization of uncertainty. Additionally, uncertainty -- e.g., in weather
forecasts -- is a familiar topic to most people. Thus, we picked it for our
visualization scenarios in study 1. We used the results of our study to
determine the most common line attributes for drawing uncertainty: Dashing,
luminance, wave amplitude, and width. While those line attributes were
especially common for drawing uncertainty, they are also commonly used in other
areas. In studies 2 and 3, we investigated the discriminability of the line
attributes determined in study 1. Studies 2 and 3 did not require specific
application areas; thus, their results apply to visualizing any scalar data in
line attributes. We evaluated the just-noticeable differences (JND) and derived
recommendations for perceptually distinct line levels. We found that
participants could discriminate considerably more levels for the line attribute
width than for wave amplitude, dashing, or luminance.

<p class="mathjax">The aquaculture industry, strongly reliant on shrimp exports, faces
challenges due to viral infections like the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV)
that severely impact output yields. In this context, computer vision can play a
significant role in identifying features not immediately evident to skilled or
untrained eyes, potentially reducing the time required to report WSSV
infections. In this study, the challenge of limited data for WSSV recognition
was addressed. A mobile application dedicated to data collection and monitoring
was developed to facilitate the creation of an image dataset to train a WSSV
recognition model and improve country-wide disease surveillance. The study also
includes a thorough analysis of WSSV recognition to address the challenge of
imbalanced learning and on-device inference. The models explored,
MobileNetV3-Small and EfficientNetV2-B0, gained an F1-Score of 0.72 and 0.99
respectively. The saliency heatmaps of both models were also observed to
uncover the "black-box" nature of these models and to gain insight as to what
features in the images are most important in making a prediction. These results
highlight the effectiveness and limitations of using models designed for
resource-constrained devices and balancing their performance in accurately
recognizing WSSV, providing valuable information and direction in the use of
computer vision in this domain.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently sparked significant
interest, which demonstrates emergent capabilities to serve as a
general-purpose model for various vision-language tasks. However, existing
methods mainly focus on limited types of instructions with a single image as
visual context, which hinders the widespread availability of MLLMs. In this
paper, we introduce the I4 benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the
instruction following ability on complicated interleaved vision-language
instructions, which involve intricate image-text sequential context, covering a
diverse range of scenarios (e.g., visually-rich webpages/textbooks, lecture
slides, embodied dialogue). Systematic evaluation on our I4 benchmark reveals a
common defect of existing methods: the Visual Prompt Generator (VPG) trained on
image-captioning alignment objective tends to attend to common foreground
information for captioning but struggles to extract specific information
required by particular tasks. To address this issue, we propose a generic and
lightweight controllable knowledge re-injection module, which utilizes the
sophisticated reasoning ability of LLMs to control the VPG to conditionally
extract instruction-specific visual information and re-inject it into the LLM.
Further, we introduce an annotation-free cross-attention guided counterfactual
image training strategy to methodically learn the proposed module by
collaborating a cascade of foundation models. Enhanced by the proposed module
and training strategy, we present Cheetah, a MLLM that can effectively handle a
wide variety of interleaved vision-language instructions and achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across all tasks of I4, without
high-quality multimodal instruction tuning data. Moreover, Cheetah also
exhibits competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art instruction
tuned models on concurrent MME benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) plays a crucial role in
evaluating and improving the visual experience of 3D content. Existing
binocular properties and attention-based methods for SIQA have achieved
promising performance. However, these bottom-up approaches are inadequate in
exploiting the inherent characteristics of the human visual system (HVS). This
paper presents a novel network for SIQA via stereo attention, employing a
top-down perspective to guide the quality assessment process. Our proposed
method realizes the guidance from high-level binocular signals down to
low-level monocular signals, while the binocular and monocular information can
be calibrated progressively throughout the processing pipeline. We design a
generalized Stereo AttenTion (SAT) block to implement the top-down philosophy
in stereo perception. This block utilizes the fusion-generated attention map as
a high-level binocular modulator, influencing the representation of two
low-level monocular features. Additionally, we introduce an Energy Coefficient
(EC) to account for recent findings indicating that binocular responses in the
primate primary visual cortex are less than the sum of monocular responses. The
adaptive EC can tune the magnitude of binocular response flexibly, thus
enhancing the formation of robust binocular features within our framework. To
extract the most discriminative quality information from the summation and
subtraction of the two branches of monocular features, we utilize a
dual-pooling strategy that applies min-pooling and max-pooling operations to
the respective branches. Experimental results highlight the superiority of our
top-down method in simulating the property of visual perception and advancing
the state-of-the-art in the SIQA field. The code of this work is available at

<p class="mathjax">We examine the current state of the cross-domain world, with particular focus
on the protocols being used/planned for use by multi-domain users. We build on
existing frameworks for analyzing how MEV is extracted, while also adding a new
categorization of intrinsic-extractable value vs. time-extractable value to
describe how MEV is generated for an extractor. Together, this provides us with
a framework with which we compare classes of protocols enabling cross-domain
MEV, and the MEV occurring within these classes. We analyze each protocol class
separately and compare current implementations to an ideal functionality for
each. We primarily focus on analyzing the MEV mitigations that these protocols
provide, both now, and into the future. In each case, we also outline the
technical barriers that current protocol implementations face. With this
methodology, we identify sequencers and order-flow auctions as cross-domain
protocols with the greatest potential to mitigate MEV, but also as protocols
with some of the biggest technical barriers.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for solving the
multi-goal path planning problem in obstacle environments. Our proposed model,
called S&amp;Reg, integrates multi-task learning networks with a TSP solver and a
path planner to quickly compute a closed and feasible path visiting all goals.
Specifically, the model first predicts promising regions that potentially
contain the optimal paths connecting two goals as a segmentation task.
Simultaneously, estimations for pairwise distances between goals are conducted
as a regression task by the neural networks, while the results construct a
symmetric weight matrix for the TSP solver. Leveraging the TSP result, the path
planner efficiently explores feasible paths guided by promising regions. We
extensively evaluate the S&amp;Reg model through simulations and compare it with
the other sampling-based algorithms. The results demonstrate that our proposed
model achieves superior performance in respect of computation time and solution
cost, making it an effective solution for multi-goal path planning in obstacle
environments. The proposed approach has the potential to be extended to other
sampling-based algorithms for multi-goal path planning.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge Representation and Reasoning is a central, longstanding, and active
area of Artificial Intelligence. Over the years it has evolved significantly;
more recently it has been challenged and complemented by research in areas such
as machine learning and reasoning under uncertainty. In July 2022 a Dagstuhl
Perspectives workshop was held on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. The
goal of the workshop was to describe the state of the art in the field,
including its relation with other areas, its shortcomings and strengths,
together with recommendations for future progress. We developed this manifesto
based on the presentations, panels, working groups, and discussions that took
place at the Dagstuhl Workshop. It is a declaration of our views on Knowledge
Representation: its origins, goals, milestones, and current foci; its relation
to other disciplines, especially to Artificial Intelligence; and on its
challenges, along with key priorities for the next decade.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-guided Video Object Segmentation (A-VOS) and Referring Video Object
Segmentation (R-VOS) are two highly-related tasks, which both aim to segment
specific objects from video sequences according to user-provided expression
prompts. However, due to the challenges in modeling representations for
different modalities, contemporary methods struggle to strike a balance between
interaction flexibility and high-precision localization and segmentation. In
this paper, we address this problem from two perspectives: the alignment
representation of audio and text and the deep interaction among audio, text,
and visual features. First, we propose a universal architecture, the Expression
Prompt Collaboration Transformer, herein EPCFormer. Next, we propose an
Expression Alignment (EA) mechanism for audio and text expressions. By
introducing contrastive learning for audio and text expressions, the proposed
EPCFormer realizes comprehension of the semantic equivalence between audio and
text expressions denoting the same objects. Then, to facilitate deep
interactions among audio, text, and video features, we introduce an
Expression-Visual Attention (EVA) mechanism. The knowledge of video object
segmentation in terms of the expression prompts can seamlessly transfer between
the two tasks by deeply exploring complementary cues between text and audio.
Experiments on well-recognized benchmarks demonstrate that our universal
EPCFormer attains state-of-the-art results on both tasks. The source code of
EPCFormer will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/lab206/EPCFormer.

<p class="mathjax">The under-display camera (UDC) provides consumers with a full-screen visual
experience without any obstruction due to notches or punched holes. However,
the semi-transparent nature of the display inevitably introduces the severe
degradation into UDC images. In this work, we address the UDC image restoration
problem with the specific consideration of the scattering effect caused by the
display. We explicitly model the scattering effect by treating the display as a
piece of homogeneous scattering medium. With the physical model of the
scattering effect, we improve the image formation pipeline for the image
synthesis to construct a realistic UDC dataset with ground truths. To suppress
the scattering effect for the eventual UDC image recovery, a two-branch
restoration network is designed. More specifically, the scattering branch
leverages global modeling capabilities of the channel-wise self-attention to
estimate parameters of the scattering effect from degraded images. While the
image branch exploits the local representation advantage of CNN to recover
clear scenes, implicitly guided by the scattering branch. Extensive experiments
are conducted on both real-world and synthesized data, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art UDC restoration
techniques. The source code and dataset are available at

<p class="mathjax">Time-dependent gravity data from satellite missions like GRACE-FO reveal mass
redistribution in the system Earth at various time scales: long-term climate
change signals, inter-annual phenomena like El Nino, seasonal mass transports
and transients, e. g. due to earthquakes. For this contemporary issue, a
classical inverse problem has to be considered: the gravitational potential has
to be modelled on the Earth's surface from measurements in space. This is also
known as the downward continuation problem. Thus, it is important to further
develop current mathematical methods for such inverse problems. For this, the
(Learning) Inverse Problem Matching Pursuits ((L)IPMPs) have been developed
within the last decade. Their unique feature is the combination of local as
well as global trial functions in the approximative solution of an inverse
problem such as the downward continuation of the gravitational potential. In
this way, they harmonize the ideas of a traditional spherical harmonic ansatz
and the radial basis function approach. Previous publications on these methods
showed proofs of concept. Here, we consider the methods for high-dimensional
experiments settings with more than 500 000 grid points which yields a
resolution of 20 km at best on a realistic satellite geometry. We also explain
the changes in the methods that had to be done to work with such a large amount
of data. The corresponding code (updated for big data use) is available at

in conjunction with a high dimensional signal to produce a desired output. In
the case of classical Sound Source Localization (SSL) algorithms, information
from a high dimensional, multichannel audio signals received by many
distributed microphones is combined with information describing acoustic
properties of the scene, such as the microphones' coordinates in space, to
estimate the position of a sound source. We introduce Dual Input Neural

<p class="mathjax">Hardware implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising approach to edge-computing for applications that require low-power
and low-latency, and which cannot resort to external cloud-based computing
services. However, most solutions proposed so far either support only
relatively small networks, or take up significant hardware resources, to
implement large networks. To realize large-scale and scalable SNNs it is
necessary to develop an efficient asynchronous communication and routing fabric
that enables the design of multi-core architectures. In particular the core
interface that manages inter-core spike communication is a crucial component as
it represents the bottleneck of Power-Performance-Area (PPA) especially for the
arbitration architecture and the routing memory. In this paper we present an
arbitration mechanism with the corresponding asynchronous encoding pipeline
circuits, based on hierarchical arbiter trees. The proposed scheme reduces the
latency by more than 70% in sparse-event mode, compared to the state-of-the-art
arbitration architectures, with lower area cost. The routing memory makes use
of asynchronous Content Addressable Memory (CAM) with Current Sensing
Completion Detection (CSCD), which saves approximately 46% energy, and achieves
a 40% increase in throughput against conventional asynchronous CAM using
configurable delay lines, at the cost of only a slight increase in area. In
addition as it radically reduces the core interface resources in multi-core
neuromorphic processors, the arbitration architecture and CAM architecture we
propose can be also applied to a wide range of general asynchronous circuits
and systems.

<p class="mathjax">In the last decades, people have been consuming and combining more drugs than
before, increasing the number of Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs). To predict
unknown DDIs, recently, studies started incorporating Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
since they are able to capture the relationships among entities providing
better drug representations than using a single drug property. In this paper,
we propose the medicX end-to-end framework that integrates several drug
features from public drug repositories into a KG and embeds the nodes in the
graph using various translation, factorisation and Neural Network (NN) based KG
Embedding (KGE) methods. Ultimately, we use a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm
that predicts unknown DDIs. Among the different translation and
factorisation-based KGE models, we found that the best performing combination
was the ComplEx embedding method with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network,
which obtained an F1-score of 95.19% on a dataset based on the DDIs found in
DrugBank version 5.1.8. This score is 5.61% better than the state-of-the-art
model DeepDDI. Additionally, we also developed a graph auto-encoder model that
uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which achieved an F1-score of 91.94%.
Consequently, GNNs have demonstrated a stronger ability to mine the underlying
semantics of the KG than the ComplEx model, and thus using higher dimension
embeddings within the GNN can lead to state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">Question answering (QA) is a critical task for speech-based retrieval from
knowledge sources, by sifting only the answers without requiring to read
supporting documents. Specifically, open-domain QA aims to answer user
questions on unrestricted knowledge sources. Ideally, adding a source should
not decrease the accuracy, but we find this property (denoted as
"monotonicity") does not hold for current state-of-the-art methods. We identify
the cause, and based on that we propose Judge-Specialist framework. Our
framework consists of (1) specialist retrievers/readers to cover individual
sources, and (2) judge, a dedicated language model to select the final answer.
Our experiments show that our framework not only ensures monotonicity, but also
outperforms state-of-the-art multi-source QA methods on Natural Questions.
Additionally, we show that our models robustly preserve the monotonicity
against noise from speech recognition. We publicly release our code and
setting.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfake videos and images are becoming increasingly credible, posing a
significant threat given their potential to facilitate fraud or bypass access
control systems. This has motivated the development of deepfake detection
methods, in which deep learning models are trained to distinguish between real
and synthesized footage. Unfortunately, existing detection models struggle to
generalize to deepfakes from datasets they were not trained on, but little work
has been done to examine why or how this limitation can be addressed. In this
paper, we present the first empirical study on the generalizability of deepfake
detectors, an essential goal for detectors to stay one step ahead of attackers.
Our study utilizes six deepfake datasets, five deepfake detection methods, and
two model augmentation approaches, confirming that detectors do not generalize
in zero-shot settings. Additionally, we find that detectors are learning
unwanted properties specific to synthesis methods and struggling to extract
discriminative features, limiting their ability to generalize. Finally, we find
that there are neurons universally contributing to detection across seen and
unseen datasets, illuminating a possible path forward to zero-shot
generalizability.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence (AI) for supporting healthcare services has never
been more necessitated than by the recent global pandemic. Here, we review the
state-of-the-art in AI-enabled Chatbots in healthcare proposed during the last
10 years (2013-2023). The focus on AI-enabled technology is because of its
potential for enhancing the quality of human-machine interaction via Chatbots,
reducing dependence on human-human interaction and saving man-hours. Our review
indicates that there are a handful of (commercial) Chatbots that are being used
for patient support, while there are others (non-commercial) that are in the
clinical trial phases. However, there is a lack of trust on this technology
regarding patient safety and data protection, as well as a lack of wider
awareness on its benefits among the healthcare workers and professionals. Also,
patients have expressed dissatisfaction with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
skills of the Chatbots in comparison to humans. Notwithstanding the recent
introduction of ChatGPT that has raised the bar for the NLP technology, this
Chatbot cannot be trusted with patient safety and medical ethics without
thorough and rigorous checks to serve in the `narrow' domain of assistive
healthcare. Our review suggests that to enable deployment and integration of
AI-enabled Chatbots in public health services, the need of the hour is: to
build technology that is simple and safe to use; to build confidence on the
technology among: (a) the medical community by focussed training and
development; (b) the patients and wider community through outreach.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has gained popularity due to
advancements in machine learning. However, untrusted third-party platforms have
raised concerns about AI security, particularly in backdoor attacks. Recent
research has shown that speech backdoors can utilize transformations as
triggers, similar to image backdoors. However, human ears easily detect these
transformations, leading to suspicion. In this paper, we introduce PaddingBack,
an inaudible backdoor attack that utilizes malicious operations to make
poisoned samples indistinguishable from clean ones. Instead of using external
perturbations as triggers, we exploit the widely used speech signal operation,
padding, to break speaker recognition systems. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a
significantly high attack success rate while maintaining a high rate of benign
accuracy. Furthermore, PaddingBack demonstrates the ability to resist defense
methods while maintaining its stealthiness against human perception. The
results of the stealthiness experiment have been made available at

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose methods for speeding up linear regression
distributively, while ensuring security. We leverage randomized sketching
techniques, and improve straggler resilience in asynchronous systems.
Specifically, we apply a random orthonormal matrix and then subsample
\textit{blocks}, to simultaneously secure the information and reduce the
dimension of the regression problem. In our setup, the transformation
corresponds to an encoded encryption in an \textit{approximate gradient coding
scheme}, and the subsampling corresponds to the responses of the non-straggling
workers; in a centralized coded computing network. This results in a
distributive \textit{iterative sketching} approach for an $\ell_2$-subspace
embedding, \textit{i.e.} a new sketch is considered at each iteration. We also
focus on the special case of the \textit{Subsampled Randomized Hadamard
Transform}, which we generalize to block sampling; and discuss how it can be
modified in order to secure the data.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: The recent proliferation of preprints could be a way for researchers
worldwide to increase the availability and visibility of their research
findings. Against the background of rising publication costs caused by the
increasing prevalence of article processing fees, the search for other ways to
publish research results besides traditional journal publication may increase.
This could be especially true for lower-income countries.
Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, we are interested in the experiences
and attitudes towards posting and using preprints in the Global South as
opposed to the Global North. To explore whether motivations and concerns about
posting preprints differ, we adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining a
quantitative survey of researchers with focus group interviews. Findings: We
found that respondents from the Global South were more likely to agree to
adhere to policies and to emphasise that mandates could change publishing
behaviour towards open access. They were also more likely to agree posting
preprints has a positive impact. Respondents from the Global South and the
Global North emphasised the importance of peer-reviewed research for career
advancement. Originality: The study has identified a wide range of experiences
with and attitudes towards posting preprints among researchers in the Global
South and the Global North. To our knowledge, this has hardly been studied
before, which is also because preprints only have emerged lately in many
disciplines and countries.

<p class="mathjax">In XAI it is important to consider that, in contrast to explanations for
professional audiences, one cannot assume common expertise when explaining for
laypeople. But such explanations between humans vary greatly, making it
difficult to research commonalities across explanations. We used the dual
nature theory, a techno-philosophical approach, to cope with these challenges.
According to it, one can explain, for example, an XAI's decision by addressing
its dual nature: by focusing on the Architecture (e.g., the logic of its
algorithms) or the Relevance (e.g., the severity of a decision, the
implications of a recommendation). We investigated 20 game explanations using
the theory as an analytical framework. We elaborate how we used the theory to
quickly structure and compare explanations of technological artifacts. We
supplemented results from analyzing the explanation contents with results from
a video recall to explore how explainers justified their explanation. We found
that explainers were focusing on the physical aspects of the game first
(Architecture) and only later on aspects of the Relevance. Reasoning in the
video recalls indicated that EX regarded the focus on the Architecture as
important for structuring the explanation initially by explaining the basic
components before focusing on more complex, intangible aspects. Shifting
between addressing the two sides was justified by explanation goals, emerging
misunderstandings, and the knowledge needs of the explainee. We discovered
several commonalities that inspire future research questions which, if further
generalizable, provide first ideas for the construction of synthetic
explanations.

<p class="mathjax">The recently developed deep algorithms achieve promising progress in the
field of image copy-move forgery detection (CMFD). However, they have limited
generalizability in some practical scenarios, where the copy-move objects may
not appear in the training images or cloned regions are from the background. To
address the above issues, in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end CMFD
framework by integrating merits from both conventional and deep methods.
Specifically, we design a deep cross-scale patchmatch method tailored for CMFD
to localize copy-move regions. In contrast to existing deep models, our scheme
aims to seek explicit and reliable point-to-point matching between source and
target regions using features extracted from high-resolution scales. Further,
we develop a manipulation region location branch for source/target separation.
The proposed CMFD framework is completely differentiable and can be trained in
an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the high
generalizability of our method to different copy-move contents, and the
proposed scheme achieves significantly better performance than existing
approaches.

of signals and modules, combined with a proper specification of their timing
constraints, which can be a complex and error-prone process, using standard
Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). In this paper we introduce Yak, a new
dataflow description language for asynchronous bundled data circuits. Yak
allows designers to generate Verilog and timing constraints automatically, from
a textual description of bundled data control flow structures and combinational
logic blocks. The timing constraints are generated using the Local Clock Set
methodology and can be consumed by standard industry tools. Yak includes
ergonomic language features such as structured bindings of channels undergoing
fork and join operations, named value scope propagation along channels, and
channel typing. Here we present Yak's language front-end and compare the
automated synthesis and layout results of an example circuit with a manual
constraint specification approach.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) aims to locate a specific moment from an
untrimmed video with a given natural language query. Recently, weakly
supervised methods still have a large performance gap compared to fully
supervised ones, while the latter requires laborious timestamp annotations. In
this study, we aim to reduce the annotation cost yet keep competitive
performance for TSG task compared to fully supervised ones. To achieve this
goal, we investigate a recently proposed glance-supervised temporal sentence
grounding task, which requires only single frame annotation (referred to as
glance annotation) for each query. Under this setup, we propose a Dynamic
Gaussian prior based Grounding framework with Glance annotation (D3G), which
consists of a Semantic Alignment Group Contrastive Learning module (SA-GCL) and
a Dynamic Gaussian prior Adjustment module (DGA). Specifically, SA-GCL samples
reliable positive moments from a 2D temporal map via jointly leveraging
Gaussian prior and semantic consistency, which contributes to aligning the
positive sentence-moment pairs in the joint embedding space. Moreover, to
alleviate the annotation bias resulting from glance annotation and model
complex queries consisting of multiple events, we propose the DGA module, which
adjusts the distribution dynamically to approximate the ground truth of target
moments. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks verify the
effectiveness of the proposed D3G. It outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods by a large margin and narrows the performance gap compared
to fully supervised methods. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has become a classic paradigm to
solve diverse, intelligent control tasks like autonomous driving in Internet of
Vehicles (IoV). However, the widely assumed existence of a central node to
implement centralized federated learning-assisted MARL might be impractical in
highly dynamic scenarios, and the excessive communication overheads possibly
overwhelm the IoV system. Therefore, in this paper, we design a communication
efficient cooperative MARL algorithm, named RSM-MAPPO, to reduce the
communication overheads in a fully distributed architecture. In particular,
RSM-MAPPO enhances the multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by
incorporating the idea of segment mixture and augmenting multiple model
replicas from received neighboring policy segments. Afterwards, RSM-MAPPO
adopts a theory-guided metric to regulate the selection of contributive
replicas to guarantee the policy improvement. Finally, extensive simulations in
a mixed-autonomy traffic control scenario verify the effectiveness of the
RSM-MAPPO algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Current learning-based edge caching schemes usually suffer from dynamic
content popularity, e.g., in the emerging short video platforms, users' request
patterns shift significantly over time and across different edges. An intuitive
solution for a specific local edge cache is to collect more request histories
from other edge caches. However, uniformly merging these request histories may
not perform satisfactorily due to heterogeneous content distributions on
different edges. To solve this problem, we propose a collaborative edge caching
framework. First, we design a meta-learning-based collaborative strategy to
guarantee that the local model can timely meet the continually changing content
popularity. Then, we design an edge sampling method to select more "valuable"
neighbor edges to participate in the local training. To evaluate the proposed
framework, we conduct trace-driven experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
of our design: it improves the average cache hit rate by up to $10.12\%$
(normalized) compared with other baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Open-world instance segmentation is a rising task, which aims to segment all
objects in the image by learning from a limited number of base-category
objects. This task is challenging, as the number of unseen categories could be
hundreds of times larger than that of seen categories. Recently, the DETR-like
models have been extensively studied in the closed world while stay unexplored
in the open world. In this paper, we utilize the Transformer for open-world
instance segmentation and present SWORD. Firstly, we introduce to attach the
stop-gradient operation before classification head and further add IoU heads
for discovering novel objects. We demonstrate that a simple stop-gradient
operation not only prevents the novel objects from being suppressed as
background, but also allows the network to enjoy the merit of heuristic label
assignment. Secondly, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to
enlarge the representations between objects and background. Specifically, we
maintain a universal object queue to obtain the object center, and dynamically
select positive and negative samples from the object queries for contrastive
learning. While the previous works only focus on pursuing average recall and
neglect average precision, we show the prominence of SWORD by giving
consideration to both criteria. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance
in various open-world cross-category and cross-dataset generalizations.
Particularly, in VOC to non-VOC setup, our method sets new state-of-the-art
results of 40.0% on ARb100 and 34.9% on ARm100. For COCO to UVO generalization,
SWORD significantly outperforms the previous best open-world model by 5.9% on
APm and 8.1% on ARm100.

<p class="mathjax">X-ray microspectroscopic techniques are essential for studying morphological
and chemical changes in materials, providing high-resolution structural and
spectroscopic information. However, its practical data analysis for reliably
retrieving the chemical states remains a major obstacle to accelerating the
fundamental understanding of materials in many research fields. In this work,
we propose a novel data formulation model for X-ray microspectroscopy and
develop a dedicated unmixing framework to solve this problem, which is robust
to noise and spectral variability. Moreover, this framework is not limited to
the analysis of two-state material chemistry, making it an effective
alternative to conventional and widely-used methods. In addition, an
alternative directional multiplier method with provable convergence is applied
to obtain the solution efficiently. Our framework can accurately identify and
characterize chemical states in complex and heterogeneous samples, even under
challenging conditions such as low signal-to-noise ratios and overlapping
spectral features. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real
datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and reliability.

<p class="mathjax">The paper compares two generic techniques for deriving lower bounds and
impossibility results in distributed computing. First, we prove a speedup
theorem (a-la Brandt, 2019), for wait-free colorless algorithms, aiming at
capturing the essence of the seminal round-reduction proof establishing a lower
bound on the number of rounds for 3-coloring a cycle (Linial, 1992), and going
by backward induction. Second, we consider FLP-style proofs, aiming at
capturing the essence of the seminal consensus impossibility proof (Fischer,
Lynch, and Paterson, 1985) and using forward induction.
<br />We show that despite their very different natures, these two forms of proof
are tightly connected. In particular, we show that for every colorless task
$\Pi$, if there is a round-reduction proof establishing the impossibility of
solving $\Pi$ using wait-free colorless algorithms, then there is an FLP-style
proof establishing the same impossibility. For 1-dimensional colorless tasks
(for an arbitrary number $n\geq 2$ of processes), we prove that the two proof
techniques have exactly the same power, and more importantly, both are
complete: if a 1-dimensional colorless task is not wait-free solvable by $n\geq
2$ processes, then the impossibility can be proved by both proof techniques.
Moreover, a round-reduction proof can be automatically derived, and an
FLP-style proof can be automatically generated from it.
<br />Finally, we illustrate the use of these two techniques by establishing the
impossibility of solving any colorless covering task of arbitrary dimension by
wait-free algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">The core reasoning task for datalog engines is materialization, the
evaluation of a datalog program over a database alongside its physical
incorporation into the database itself. The de-facto method of computing it, is
through the recursive application of inference rules. Due to it being a costly
operation, it is a must for datalog engines to provide incremental
materialization, that is, to adjust the computation to new data, instead of
restarting from scratch. One of the major caveats, is that deleting data is
notoriously more involved than adding, since one has to take into account all
possible data that has been entailed from what is being deleted. Differential
Dataflow is a computational model that provides efficient incremental
maintenance, notoriously with equal performance between additions and
deletions, and work distribution, of iterative dataflows. In this paper we
investigate the performance of materialization with three reference datalog
implementations, out of which one is built on top of a lightweight relational
engine, and the two others are differential-dataflow and non-differential
versions of the same rewrite algorithm, with the same optimizations.

<p class="mathjax">Retrieval augmented models show promise in enhancing traditional language
models by improving their contextual understanding, integrating private data,
and reducing hallucination. However, the processing time required for retrieval
augmented large language models poses a challenge when applying them to tasks
that require real-time responses, such as composition assistance.
<br />To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (HybridRAG) framework that leverages a hybrid setting that combines
both client and cloud models. HybridRAG incorporates retrieval-augmented memory
generated asynchronously by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the cloud. By
integrating this retrieval augmented memory, the client model acquires the
capability to generate highly effective responses, benefiting from the LLM's
capabilities. Furthermore, through asynchronous memory integration, the client
model is capable of delivering real-time responses to user requests without the
need to wait for memory synchronization from the cloud. Our experiments on
Wikitext and Pile subsets show that HybridRAG achieves lower latency than a
cloud-based retrieval-augmented LLM, while outperforming client-only models in
utility.

segmentation, nevertheless, its performance on underwater images is still
restricted. This work presents AquaSAM, the first attempt to extend the success
of SAM on underwater images with the purpose of creating a versatile method for

classifying and extracting various labels automatically in SUIM dataset.
Subsequently, we develop a straightforward fine-tuning method to adapt SAM to
general foreground underwater image segmentation. Through extensive experiments
involving eight segmentation tasks like human divers, we demonstrate that
AquaSAM outperforms the default SAM model especially at hard tasks like coral

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a methodology for investigating the application of
semantic attention to enhance the explainability of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models, introducing semantically-informed perturbations and
establishing a correlation between predicted feature-importance weights and
model accuracy. Graph Deep Learning (GDL) has emerged as a promising field for
tasks like scene interpretation, leveraging flexible graph structures to
concisely describe complex features and relationships. As traditional
explainability methods used in eXplainable AI (XAI) cannot be directly applied
to such structures, graph-specific approaches are introduced. Attention
mechanisms have demonstrated their efficacy in estimating the importance of
input features in deep learning models and thus have been previously employed
to provide feature-based explanations for GNN predictions. Building upon these
insights, we extend existing attention-based graph-explainability methods
investigating the use of attention weights as importance indicators of
semantically sorted feature sets. Through analysing the behaviour of predicted
attention-weights distribution in correlation with model accuracy, we gain
valuable insights into feature importance with respect to the behaviour of the
GNN model. We apply our methodology to a lidar pointcloud estimation model
successfully identifying key semantic classes that contribute to enhanced
performance effectively generating reliable post-hoc semantic explanations.

<p class="mathjax">Many methods for the verification of complex computer systems require the
existence of a tractable mathematical abstraction of the system, often in the
form of an automaton. In reality, however, such a model is hard to come up
with, in particular manually. Automata learning is a technique that can
automatically infer an automaton model from a system -- by observing its
behaviour. The majority of automata learning algorithms is based on the
so-called L* algorithm. The acceptor learned by L* has an important property:
it is canonical, in the sense that, it is, up to isomorphism, the unique
deterministic finite automaton of minimal size accepting a given regular
language. Establishing a similar result for other classes of acceptors, often
with side-effects, is of great practical importance. Non-deterministic finite
automata, for instance, can be exponentially more succinct than deterministic
ones, allowing verification to scale. Unfortunately, identifying a canonical
size-minimal non-deterministic acceptor of a given regular language is in
general not possible: it can happen that a regular language is accepted by two
non-isomorphic non-deterministic finite automata of minimal size. In
particular, it thus is unclear which one of the automata should be targeted by
a learning algorithm. In this thesis, we further explore the issue and identify
(sub-)classes of acceptors that admit canonical size-minimal representatives.

<p class="mathjax">Memory, as the basis of learning, determines the storage, update and
forgetting of the knowledge and further determines the efficiency of learning.
Featured with a mechanism of memory, a radial basis function neural network
(RBFNN) based learning control scheme named real-time progressive learning
(RTPL) is proposed to learn the unknown dynamics of the system with guaranteed
stability and closed-loop performance. Instead of the stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) update law in adaptive neural control (ANC), RTPL adopts the
selective memory recursive least squares (SMRLS) algorithm to update the
weights of the RBFNN. Through SMRLS, the approximation capabilities of the
RBFNN are uniformly distributed over the feature space and thus the passive
knowledge forgetting phenomenon of SGD method is suppressed. Subsequently, RTPL
achieves the following merits over the classical ANC: 1) guaranteed learning
capability under low-level persistent excitation (PE), 2) improved learning
performance (learning speed, accuracy and generalization capability), and 3)
low gain requirement ensuring robustness of RTPL in practical applications.
Moreover, the RTPL based learning and control will gradually reinforce each
other during the task execution, making it appropriate for long-term learning
control tasks. As an example, RTPL is used to address the tracking control
problem of a class of nonlinear systems with RBFNN being an adaptive
feedforward controller. Corresponding theoretical analysis and simulation
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of RTPL.

<p class="mathjax">Robust authentication for low-power consumer devices such as doorbell cameras
poses a valuable and unique challenge. This work explores the effect of age and
aging on the performance of facial authentication methods. Two public age
datasets, AgeDB and Morph-II have been used as baselines in this work. A
photo-realistic age transformation method has been employed to augment a set of
high-quality facial images with various age effects. Then the effect of these
synthetic aging data on the high-performance deep-learning-based face
recognition model is quantified by using various metrics including Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and match score distributions.
Experimental results demonstrate that long-term age effects are still a
significant challenge for the state-of-the-art facial authentication method.

<p class="mathjax">When searching for products, the opinions of others play an important role in
making informed decisions. Subjective experiences about a product can be a
valuable source of information. This is also true in sales conversations, where
a customer and a sales assistant exchange facts and opinions about products.
However, training an AI for such conversations is complicated by the fact that
language models do not possess authentic opinions for their lack of real-world
experience. We address this problem by leveraging product reviews as a rich
source of product opinions to ground conversational AI in true subjective
narratives. With OpinionConv, we develop the first conversational AI for
simulating sales conversations. To validate the generated conversations, we
conduct several user studies showing that the generated opinions are perceived
as realistic. Our assessors also confirm the importance of opinions as an
informative basis for decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Multiphysics processes in fractured porous media is a research field of
importance for several subsurface applications and has received considerable
attention over the last decade. The dynamics are characterised by strong
couplings between processes as well as interaction between the processes and
the structure of the fractured medium itself. The rich range of behavior calls
for explorative mathematical modelling, such as experimentation with
constitutive laws and novel coupling concepts between physical processes.
Moreover, efficient simulations of the strong couplings between multiphysics
processes and geological structures require the development of tailored
numerical methods.
<br />We present a modelling framework and its implementation in the open-source
simulation toolbox PorePy, which is designed for rapid prototyping of
multiphysics processes in fractured porous media. PorePy uses a
mixed-dimensional representation of the fracture geometry and generally applies
fully implicit couplings between processes. The code design follows the
paradigms of modularity and differentiable programming, which together allow
for extreme flexibility in experimentation with governing equations with
minimal changes to the code base. The code integrity is supported by a
multilevel testing framework ensuring the reliability of the code.
<br />We present our modelling framework within a context of thermo-poroelasticity
in deformable fractured porous media, illustrating the close relation between
the governing equations and the source code. We furthermore discuss the design
of the testing framework and present simulations showcasing the extendibility
of PorePy, as well as the type of results that can be produced by
mixed-dimensional simulation tools.

<p class="mathjax">Consider a setting in which devices and a server share a pre-trained model.
The server wishes to make an inference on a new input given the model. Devices
have access to data, previously not used for training, and can communicate to
the server over a common wireless channel. If the devices have no access to the
new input, can communication from devices to the server enhance the quality of
the inference decision at the server? Recent work has introduced federated
conformal prediction (CP), which leverages devices-to-server communication to
improve the reliability of the server's decision. With federated CP, devices
communicate to the server information about the loss accrued by the shared
pre-trained model on the local data, and the server leverages this information
to calibrate a decision interval, or set, so that it is guaranteed to contain
the correct answer with a pre-defined target reliability level. Previous work
assumed noise-free communication, whereby devices can communicate a single real
number to the server. In this paper, we study for the first time federated CP
in a wireless setting. We introduce a novel protocol, termed wireless federated
conformal prediction (WFCP), which builds on type-based multiple access (TBMA)
and on a novel quantile correction strategy. WFCP is proved to provide formal
reliability guarantees in terms of coverage of the predicted set produced by
the server. Using numerical results, we demonstrate the significant advantages
of WFCP against digital implementations of existing federated CP schemes,
especially in regimes with limited communication resources and/or large number
of devices.

<p class="mathjax">The product carbon footprint (PCF) is crucial for decarbonizing the supply
chain, as it measures the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions caused
by all activities during the product's life cycle. However, PCF accounting
often requires expert knowledge and significant time to construct life cycle
models. In this study, we test and compare the emergent ability of five large
language models (LLMs) in modeling the 'cradle-to-gate' life cycles of products
and generating the inventory data of inputs and outputs, revealing their
limitations as a generalized PCF knowledge database. By utilizing LLMs, we
propose an automatic AI-driven PCF accounting framework, called AutoPCF, which
also applies deep learning algorithms to automatically match calculation
parameters, and ultimately calculate the PCF. The results of estimating the
carbon footprint for three case products using the AutoPCF framework
demonstrate its potential in achieving automatic modeling and estimation of PCF
with a large reduction in modeling time from days to minutes.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in
computer vision tasks. With inference time being a crucial factor, particularly
in dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, knowledge distillation
has emerged as a successful technique for improving the accuracy of lightweight
student networks. The existing methods often neglect the information in
channels and among different classes. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel method called Inter-Class Similarity Distillation (ICSD) for
the purpose of knowledge distillation. The proposed method transfers high-order
relations from the teacher network to the student network by independently
computing intra-class distributions for each class from network outputs. This
is followed by calculating inter-class similarity matrices for distillation
using KL divergence between distributions of each pair of classes. To further
improve the effectiveness of the proposed method, an Adaptive Loss Weighting
(ALW) training strategy is proposed. Unlike existing methods, the ALW strategy
gradually reduces the influence of the teacher network towards the end of
training process to account for errors in teacher's predictions. Extensive
experiments conducted on two well-known datasets for semantic segmentation,
Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012, validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method in terms of mIoU and pixel accuracy. The proposed method outperforms
most of existing knowledge distillation methods as demonstrated by both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">The human brain can easily focus on one speaker and suppress others in
scenarios such as a cocktail party. Recently, researchers found that auditory
attention can be decoded from the electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However,
most existing deep learning methods are difficult to use prior knowledge of
different views (that is attended speech and EEG are task-related views) and
extract an unsatisfactory representation. Inspired by Broadbent's filter model,
we decode auditory attention in a multi-view paradigm and extract the most
relevant and important information utilizing the missing view. Specifically, we
propose an auditory attention decoding (AAD) method based on multi-view VAE
with task-related multi-view contrastive (TMC) learning. Employing TMC learning
in multi-view VAE can utilize the missing view to accumulate prior knowledge of
different views into the fusion of representation, and extract the approximate
task-related representation. We examine our method on two popular AAD datasets,
and demonstrate the superiority of our method by comparing it to the
state-of-the-art method.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems aim to enhance the overall user experience by providing
tailored recommendations for a variety of products and services. These systems
help users make more informed decisions, leading to greater user satisfaction
with the platform. However, the implementation of these systems largely depends
on the context, which can vary from recommending an item or package to a user
or a group. This requires careful exploration of several models during the
deployment, as there is no comprehensive and unified approach that deals with
recommendations at different levels. Furthermore, these individual models must
be closely attuned to their generated recommendations depending on the context
to prevent significant variation in their generated recommendations. In this
paper, we propose a novel unified recommendation framework that addresses all
four recommendation tasks, namely personalized, group, package, or
package-to-group recommendation, filling the gap in the current research
landscape. The proposed framework can be integrated with most of the
traditional matrix factorization-based collaborative filtering models. The idea
is to enhance the formulation of the existing approaches by incorporating
components focusing on the exploitation of the group and package latent
factors. These components also help in exploiting a rich latent representation
of the user/item by enforcing them to align closely with their corresponding
group/package representation. We consider two prominent CF techniques,
Regularized Matrix Factorization and Maximum Margin Matrix factorization, as
the baseline models and demonstrate their customization to various
recommendation tasks. Experiment results on two publicly available datasets are
reported, comparing them to other baseline approaches that consider individual
rating feedback for group or package recommendations.

<p class="mathjax">Capturing and annotating Sign language datasets is a time consuming and
costly process. Current datasets are orders of magnitude too small to
successfully train unconstrained \acf{slt} models. As a result, research has
turned to TV broadcast content as a source of large-scale training data,
consisting of both the sign language interpreter and the associated audio
subtitle. However, lack of sign language annotation limits the usability of
this data and has led to the development of automatic annotation techniques
such as sign spotting. These spottings are aligned to the video rather than the
subtitle, which often results in a misalignment between the subtitle and
spotted signs. In this paper we propose a method for aligning spottings with
their corresponding subtitles using large spoken language models. Using a
single modality means our method is computationally inexpensive and can be
utilized in conjunction with existing alignment techniques. We quantitatively
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the \acf{mdgs} and \acf{bobsl}
datasets, recovering up to a 33.22 BLEU-1 score in word alignment.

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing visual stimuli from brain recordings has been a meaningful and
challenging task. Especially, the achievement of precise and controllable image
reconstruction bears great significance in propelling the progress and
utilization of brain-computer interfaces. Despite the advancements in complex
image reconstruction techniques, the challenge persists in achieving a cohesive
alignment of both semantic (concepts and objects) and structure (position,
orientation, and size) with the image stimuli. To address the aforementioned
issue, we propose a two-stage image reconstruction model called MindDiffuser.
In Stage 1, the VQ-VAE latent representations and the CLIP text embeddings
decoded from fMRI are put into Stable Diffusion, which yields a preliminary
image that contains semantic information. In Stage 2, we utilize the CLIP
visual feature decoded from fMRI as supervisory information, and continually
adjust the two feature vectors decoded in Stage 1 through backpropagation to
align the structural information. The results of both qualitative and
quantitative analyses demonstrate that our model has surpassed the current
state-of-the-art models on Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD). The subsequent
experimental findings corroborate the neurobiological plausibility of the
model, as evidenced by the interpretability of the multimodal feature employed,
which align with the corresponding brain responses.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past decade, a long line of research has investigated the
distributed complexity landscape of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems
on bounded-degree graphs, culminating in an almost-complete classification on
general graphs and a complete classification on trees. The latter states that,
on bounded-degree trees, any LCL problem has deterministic \emph{worst-case}
time complexity $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log^* n)$, $\Theta(\log n)$, or
$\Theta(n^{1/k})$ for some positive integer $k$, and all of those complexity
classes are nonempty. Moreover, randomness helps only for (some) problems with
deterministic worst-case complexity $\Theta(\log n)$, and if randomness helps
(asymptotically), then it helps exponentially.
<br />In this work, we study how many distributed rounds are needed \emph{on
average per node} in order to solve an LCL problem on trees. We obtain a
partial classification of the deterministic \emph{node-averaged} complexity
landscape for LCL problems. As our main result, we show that every problem with
worst-case round complexity $O(\log n)$ has deterministic node-averaged
complexity $O(\log^* n)$. We further establish bounds on the node-averaged
complexity of problems with worst-case complexity $\Theta(n^{1/k})$: we show
that all these problems have node-averaged complexity $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1
/ (2^k - 1)})$, and that this lower bound is tight for some problems.

<p class="mathjax">This work present generalized forgetting recursive least squares (GF-RLS), a
generalization of recursive least squares (RLS) that encompasses many
extensions of RLS as special cases. First, sufficient conditions are presented
for the 1) Lyapunov stability, 2) uniform Lyapunov stability, 3) global
asymptotic stability, and 4) global uniform exponential stability of parameter
estimation error in GF-RLS when estimating fixed parameters without noise.
Second, robustness guarantees are derived for the estimation of time-varying
parameters in the presence of measurement noise and regressor noise. These
robustness guarantees are presented in terms of global uniform ultimate
boundedness of the parameter estimation error. A specialization of this result
gives a bound to the asymptotic bias of least squares estimators in the

<p class="mathjax">While FPGA is a suitable platform for implementing cryptographic algorithms,
there are several challenges associated with implementing Optimal Ate pairing
on FPGA, such as security, limited computing resources, and high power
consumption. To overcome these issues, this study introduces three approaches
that can execute the optimal Ate pairing on Barreto-Naehrig curves using
Jacobean coordinates with the goal of reaching 128-bit security on the Genesys
board. The first approach is a pure software implementation utilizing the
MicroBlaze processor. The second involves a combination of software and
hardware, with key operations in $F_{p}$ and $F_{p^{2}}$ being transformed into
IP cores for the MicroBlaze. The third approach builds on the second by
incorporating parallelism to improve the pairing process. The utilization of
multiple MicroBlaze processors within a single system offers both versatility
and parallelism to speed up pairing calculations. A variety of methods and
parameters are used to optimize the pairing computation, including Montgomery
modular multiplication, the Karatsuba method, Jacobean coordinates, the Complex
squaring method, sparse multiplication, squaring in $G_{\phi 6}F_{p^{12}}$, and
the addition chain method. The proposed systems are designed to efficiently
utilize limited resources in restricted environments, while still completing
tasks in a timely manner.

that combines the Barlow Twins self-supervised learning framework with DER

dimensional collapse by enforcing information spread to the whole space. This
helps RL algorithms to utilize uniformly spread state representation that

<p class="mathjax">We study the tolerant testing problem for high-dimensional samplers. Given as
input two samplers $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ over the $n$-dimensional
space $\{0,1\}^n$, and two parameters $\varepsilon_2 &gt; \varepsilon_1$, the goal
of tolerant testing is to test whether the distributions generated by
$\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are $\varepsilon_1$-close or
$\varepsilon_2$-far. Since exponential lower bounds (in $n$) are known for the
problem in the standard sampling model, research has focused on models where
one can draw \textit{conditional} samples.
<br />Among these models, \textit{subcube conditioning} ($\mathsf{SUBCOND}$), which
allows conditioning on arbitrary subcubes of the domain, holds the promise of
widespread adoption in practice owing to its ability to capture the natural
behavior of samplers in constrained domains. To translate the promise into
practice, we need to overcome two crucial roadblocks for tests based on
$\mathsf{SUBCOND}$: the prohibitively large number of queries
($\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5/\varepsilon_2^5)$) and limitation to non-tolerant
testing (i.e., $\varepsilon_1 = 0$).
<br />The primary contribution of this work is to overcome the above challenges: we
design a new tolerant testing methodology (i.e., $\varepsilon_1 \geq 0$) that
allows us to significantly improve the upper bound to
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3/(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1)^5)$.

Here we propose an automatic red teaming framework that evaluates a given model

different in-context attack strategies to automatically learn effective and

<p class="mathjax">Information diffusion prediction aims at predicting the target users in the
information diffusion path on social networks. Prior works mainly focus on the
observed structure or sequence of cascades, trying to predict to whom this
cascade will be infected passively. In this study, we argue that user intent
understanding is also a key part of information diffusion prediction. We
thereby propose a novel Multi-scale Context-enhanced Dynamic Attention Network
(MCDAN) to predict which user will most likely join the observed current
cascades. Specifically, to consider the global interactive relationship among
users, we take full advantage of user friendships and global cascading
relationships, which are extracted from the social network and historical
cascades, respectively. To refine the model's ability to understand the user's
preference for the current cascade, we propose a multi-scale sequential
hypergraph attention module to capture the dynamic preference of users at
different time scales. Moreover, we design a contextual attention enhancement
module to strengthen the interaction of user representations within the current
cascade. Finally, to engage the user's own susceptibility, we construct a
susceptibility label for each user based on user susceptibility analysis and
use the rank of this label for auxiliary prediction. We conduct experiments
over four widely used datasets and show that MCDAN significantly overperforms
the state-of-the-art models. The average improvements are up to 10.61% in terms
of Hits@100 and 9.71% in terms of MAP@100, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are often governed by Decentralized
Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which are implemented via governance protocols.
Governance tokens are distributed to users of the platform, granting them
voting rights in the platform's governance protocol. Many DeFi platforms have
already been subject to attacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in
user funds.
<br />In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended
and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users
often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are
negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.
<br />We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance
protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the
transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the
movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to
perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi
platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own
agenda at the expense of the host platform.

<p class="mathjax">Although Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown a strong capacity to solve
large-scale problems in many areas, such DNNs are hard to be deployed in
real-world systems due to their voluminous parameters. To tackle this issue,
Teacher-Student architectures were proposed, where simple student networks with
a few parameters can achieve comparable performance to deep teacher networks
with many parameters. Recently, Teacher-Student architectures have been
effectively and widely embraced on various knowledge distillation (KD)
objectives, including knowledge compression, knowledge expansion, knowledge
adaptation, and knowledge enhancement. With the help of Teacher-Student
architectures, current studies are able to achieve multiple distillation
objectives through lightweight and generalized student networks. Different from
existing KD surveys that primarily focus on knowledge compression, this survey
first explores Teacher-Student architectures across multiple distillation
objectives. This survey presents an introduction to various knowledge
representations and their corresponding optimization objectives. Additionally,
we provide a systematic overview of Teacher-Student architectures with
representative learning algorithms and effective distillation schemes. This
survey also summarizes recent applications of Teacher-Student architectures
across multiple purposes, including classification, recognition, generation,
ranking, and regression. Lastly, potential research directions in KD are
investigated, focusing on architecture design, knowledge quality, and
theoretical studies of regression-based learning, respectively. Through this
comprehensive survey, industry practitioners and the academic community can
gain valuable insights and guidelines for effectively designing, learning, and
applying Teacher-Student architectures on various distillation objectives.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks have delivered remarkable performance and have been
widely used in various visual tasks. However, their huge size causes
significant inconvenience for transmission and storage. Many previous studies
have explored model size compression. However, these studies often approach
various lossy and lossless compression methods in isolation, leading to
challenges in achieving high compression ratios efficiently. This work proposes
a post-training model size compression method that combines lossy and lossless
compression in a unified way. We first propose a unified parametric weight
transformation, which ensures different lossy compression methods can be
performed jointly in a post-training manner. Then, a dedicated differentiable
counter is introduced to guide the optimization of lossy compression to arrive
at a more suitable point for later lossless compression. Additionally, our
method can easily control a desired global compression ratio and allocate
adaptive ratios for different layers. Finally, our method can achieve a stable
$10\times$ compression ratio without sacrificing accuracy and a $20\times$
compression ratio with minor accuracy loss in a short time. Our code is

<p class="mathjax">In this note, we explore inference-time alignment through in-context
learning. We consider a vanilla pretrained language model Llama-2 before any
fine-tuning and retrieve an average of 9 demonstration alignment examples when
the model is prompted to follow chat-style instructions. Compared to direct
prompting, the in-context alignment without changing model weights leads to a
7x increase in win-rate w.r.t. the text-davinci-003 model from OpenAI, making
the vanilla language model comparable to strong baselines with alignment
fine-tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Visual perception is an important component for autonomous navigation of
unmanned surface vessels (USV), particularly for the tasks related to
autonomous inspection and tracking. These tasks involve vision-based navigation
techniques to identify the target for navigation. Reduced visibility under
extreme weather conditions in marine environments makes it difficult for
vision-based approaches to work properly. To overcome these issues, this paper
presents an autonomous vision-based navigation framework for tracking target
objects in extreme marine conditions. The proposed framework consists of an
integrated perception pipeline that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN)
to remove noise and highlight the object features before passing them to the
object detector (i.e., YOLOv5). The detected visual features are then used by
the USV to track the target. The proposed framework has been thoroughly tested
in simulation under extremely reduced visibility due to sandstorms and fog. The
results are compared with state-of-the-art de-hazing methods across the
benchmarked MBZIRC simulation dataset, on which the proposed scheme has
outperformed the existing methods across various metrics.

established by designing the configuration of the malicious agent and its

<p class="mathjax">Fabricating and designing 3D garments has become extremely demanding with the
increasing need for synthesizing realistic dressed persons for a variety of
applications, e.g. 3D virtual try-on, digitalization of 2D clothes into 3D
apparel, and cloth animation. It thus necessitates a simple and straightforward
pipeline to obtain high-quality texture from simple input, such as 2D reference
images. Since traditional warping-based texture generation methods require a
significant number of control points to be manually selected for each type of
garment, which can be a time-consuming and tedious process. We propose a novel
method, called Cloth2Tex, which eliminates the human burden in this process.
Cloth2Tex is a self-supervised method that generates texture maps with
reasonable layout and structural consistency. Another key feature of Cloth2Tex
is that it can be used to support high-fidelity texture inpainting. This is
done by combining Cloth2Tex with a prevailing latent diffusion model. We
evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively and demonstrate
that Cloth2Tex can generate high-quality texture maps and achieve the best
visual effects in comparison to other methods. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">The Cover Suffix Tree (CST) of a string $T$ is the suffix tree of $T$ with
additional explicit nodes corresponding to halves of square substrings of $T$.
In the CST an explicit node corresponding to a substring $C$ of $T$ is
annotated with two numbers: the number of non-overlapping consecutive
occurrences of $C$ and the total number of positions in $T$ that are covered by
occurrences of $C$ in $T$. Kociumaka et al. (Algorithmica, 2015) have shown how
to compute the CST of a length-$n$ string in $O(n \log n)$ time. We show how to
compute the CST in $O(n)$ time assuming that $T$ is over an integer alphabet.
<br />Kociumaka et al. (Algorithmica, 2015; Theor. Comput. Sci., 2018) have shown
that knowing the CST of a length-$n$ string $T$, one can compute a linear-sized
representation of all seeds of $T$ as well as all shortest $\alpha$-partial
covers and seeds in $T$ for a given $\alpha$ in $O(n)$ time. Thus our result
implies linear-time algorithms computing these notions of quasiperiodicity. The
resulting algorithm computing seeds is substantially different from the
previous one (Kociumaka et al., SODA 2012, ACM Trans. Algorithms, 2020).
Kociumaka et al. (Algorithmica, 2015) proposed an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm
for computing a shortest $\alpha$-partial cover for each $\alpha=1,\ldots,n$;
we improve this complexity to $O(n)$.
<br />Our results are based on a new characterization of consecutive overlapping
occurrences of a substring $S$ of $T$ in terms of the set of runs (see Kolpakov
and Kucherov, FOCS 1999) in $T$. This new insight also leads to an $O(n)$-sized
index for reporting overlapping consecutive occurrences of a given pattern $P$
of length $m$ in $O(m+output)$ time, where $output$ is the number of
occurrences reported. In comparison, a general index for reporting bounded-gap
consecutive occurrences of Navarro and Thankachan (Theor. Comput. Sci., 2016)
uses $O(n \log n)$ space.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the challenges of real-time, large-scale, and
near-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) through enhancements to the
recently proposed LaCAM* algorithm. LaCAM* is a scalable search-based algorithm
that guarantees the eventual finding of optimal solutions for cumulative
transition costs. While it has demonstrated remarkable planning success rates,
surpassing various state-of-the-art MAPF methods, its initial solution quality
is far from optimal, and its convergence speed to the optimum is slow. To
overcome these limitations, this paper introduces several improvement
techniques, partly drawing inspiration from other MAPF methods. We provide
empirical evidence that the fusion of these techniques significantly improves
the solution quality of LaCAM*, thus further pushing the boundaries of MAPF
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) methods work in discrete time. In order to apply
RL to inherently continuous problems like robotic control, a specific time
discretization needs to be defined. This is a choice between sparse time
control, which may be easier to train, and finer time control, which may allow
for better ultimate performance. In this work, we propose SusACER, an
off-policy RL algorithm that combines the advantages of different time
discretization settings. Initially, it operates with sparse time discretization
and gradually switches to a fine one. We analyze the effects of the changing
time discretization in robotic control environments: Ant, HalfCheetah, Hopper,
and Walker2D. In all cases our proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art.

<p class="mathjax">Motion prediction is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles due to
uncertainty in the sensor data, the non-deterministic nature of future, and
complex behavior of agents. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
representing the scene as dynamic occupancy grid maps (DOGMs), associating
semantic labels to the occupied cells and incorporating map information. We
propose a novel framework that combines deep-learning-based spatio-temporal and
probabilistic approaches to predict vehicle behaviors.Contrary to the
conventional OGM prediction methods, evaluation of our work is conducted
against the ground truth annotations. We experiment and validate our results on
real-world NuScenes dataset and show that our model shows superior ability to
predict both static and dynamic vehicles compared to OGM predictions.
Furthermore, we perform an ablation study and assess the role of semantic
labels and map in the architecture.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, semantic communication has been a popular research topic for
its superiority in communication efficiency. As semantic communication relies
on deep learning to extract meaning from raw messages, it is vulnerable to
attacks targeting deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce the model
inversion eavesdropping attack (MIEA) to reveal the risk of privacy leaks in
the semantic communication system. In MIEA, the attacker first eavesdrops the
signal being transmitted by the semantic communication system and then performs
model inversion attack to reconstruct the raw message, where both the white-box
and black-box settings are considered. Evaluation results show that MIEA can
successfully reconstruct the raw message with good quality under different
channel conditions. We then propose a defense method based on random
permutation and substitution to defend against MIEA in order to achieve secure
semantic communication. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed defense method in preventing MIEA.

attacker that is trying to degrade the performance of query, insertion and
deletion operations. Our defense makes use of resource burning (RB) -- the the
verifiable expenditure of network resources -- where the issuer of a request
incurs some RB cost. Our algorithm, Depth Charge, charges RB costs for
operations based on the depth of the appropriate object in the list that the
object hashes to in the table. By appropriately setting the RB costs, our
algorithm mitigates the impact of an attacker on the hash table's performance.
In particular, in the presence of a significant attack, our algorithm incurs a
cost which is asymptotically less that the attacker's cost.

<p class="mathjax">The history of metaphor research also marks the evolution of knowledge
infusion research. With the continued advancement of deep learning techniques
in recent years, the natural language processing community has shown great
interest in applying knowledge to successful results in metaphor recognition
tasks. Although there has been a gradual increase in the number of approaches
involving knowledge injection in the field of metaphor recognition, there is a
lack of a complete review article on knowledge injection based approaches.
Therefore, the goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of
research advances in the application of deep learning for knowledge injection
in metaphor recognition tasks. In this paper, we systematically summarize and
generalize the mainstream knowledge and knowledge injection principles, as well
as review the datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmark models used in
metaphor recognition tasks. Finally, we explore the current issues facing
knowledge injection methods and provide an outlook on future research
directions.

in some cases, comparable in quality to the text produced by people. In the
computing education context, these models are being used to generate code, code
explanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoption of these models has
prompted multiple position papers and workshops which discuss the implications
of these models for computing education, both positive and negative. This paper
presents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with 12 students
and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences, and preferences regarding
the use of tools powered by generative AI in computing classrooms. The results
suggest that Generative AI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant
role in computing education. However, students and instructors also raised
numerous concerns about how these models should be integrated to best support
the needs and learning goals of students. We also identified interesting
tensions and alignments that emerged between how instructors and students
prefer to engage with these models. We discuss these results and provide
recommendations related to curriculum development, assessment methods, and
pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become increasingly prevalent, it's
important to understand educational stakeholders' preferences and values to
ensure that these tools can be used for good and that potential harms can be
mitigated.

<p class="mathjax">The abilities to understand the social interaction behaviors between a
vehicle and its surroundings while predicting its trajectory in an urban
environment are critical for road safety in autonomous driving. Social
interactions are hard to explain because of their uncertainty. In recent years,
neural network-based methods have been widely used for trajectory prediction
and have been shown to outperform hand-crafted methods. However, these methods
suffer from their lack of interpretability. In order to overcome this
limitation, we combine the interpretability of a discrete choice model with the
high accuracy of a neural network-based model for the task of vehicle
trajectory prediction in an interactive environment. We implement and evaluate
our model using the INTERACTION dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed architecture to explain its predictions without compromising the
accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">At the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2023, Apple introduced
the Vision Pro. The Vision Pro is a Mixed Reality (MR) headset, more
specifically it is a Virtual Reality (VR) device with an additional Video
See-Through (VST) capability. The VST capability turns the Vision Pro also into
an Augmented Reality (AR) device. The AR feature is enabled by streaming the
real world via cameras to the (VR) screens in front of the user's eyes. This is
of course not unique and similar to other devices, like the Varjo XR-3.
Nevertheless, the Vision Pro has some interesting features, like an inside-out
screen that can show the headset wearers' eyes to "outsiders" or a button on
the top, called "Digital Crown", that allows you to seamlessly blend digital
content with your physical space by turning it. In addition, it is untethered,
except for the cable to the battery, which makes the headset more agile,
compared to the Varjo XR-3. This could actually come closer to the "Ultimate
Display", which Ivan Sutherland had already sketched in 1965. Not available to
the public yet, like the Ultimate Display, we want to take a look into the
crystal ball in this perspective to see if it can overcome some clinical
challenges that - especially - AR still faces in the medical domain, but also
go beyond and discuss if the Vision Pro could support clinicians in essential
tasks to spend more time with their patients.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, there has been extensive study of cooperative multi-agent
multi-armed bandits where a set of distributed agents cooperatively play the
same multi-armed bandit game. The goal is to develop bandit algorithms with the
optimal group and individual regrets and low communication between agents. The
prior work tackled this problem using two paradigms: leader-follower and fully
distributed algorithms. Prior algorithms in both paradigms achieve the optimal
group regret. The leader-follower algorithms achieve constant communication
costs but fail to achieve optimal individual regrets. The state-of-the-art
fully distributed algorithms achieve optimal individual regrets but fail to
achieve constant communication costs. This paper presents a simple yet
effective communication policy and integrates it into a learning algorithm for
cooperative bandits. Our algorithm achieves the best of both paradigms: optimal
individual regret and constant communication costs.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a new transformer-based regularization to better
localize objects for Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). In
image-level WSSS, Class Activation Map (CAM) is adopted to generate object
localization as pseudo segmentation labels. To address the partial activation
issue of the CAMs, consistency regularization is employed to maintain
activation intensity invariance across various image augmentations. However,
such methods ignore pair-wise relations among regions within each CAM, which
capture context and should also be invariant across image views. To this end,
we propose a new all-pairs consistency regularization (ACR). Given a pair of
augmented views, our approach regularizes the activation intensities between a
pair of augmented views, while also ensuring that the affinity across regions
within each view remains consistent. We adopt vision transformers as the
self-attention mechanism naturally embeds pair-wise affinity. This enables us
to simply regularize the distance between the attention matrices of augmented
image pairs. Additionally, we introduce a novel class-wise localization method
that leverages the gradients of the class token. Our method can be seamlessly
integrated into existing WSSS methods using transformers without modifying the
architectures. We evaluate our method on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Our
method produces noticeably better class localization maps (67.3% mIoU on PASCAL
VOC train), resulting in superior WSSS performances.

<p class="mathjax">Person search has recently been a challenging task in the computer vision
domain, which aims to search specific pedestrians from real
cameras.Nevertheless, most surveillance videos comprise only a handful of
images of each pedestrian, which often feature identical backgrounds and
clothing. Hence, it is difficult to learn more discriminative features for
person search in real scenes. To tackle this challenge, we draw on Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) to synthesize data from surveillance videos. GAN has
thrived in computer vision problems because it produces high-quality images
efficiently. We merely alter the popular Fast R-CNN model, which is capable of
processing videos and yielding accurate detection outcomes. In order to
appropriately relieve the pressure brought by the two-stage model, we design an
Assisted-Identity Query Module (AIDQ) to provide positive images for the behind
part. Besides, the proposed novel GAN-based Scene Synthesis model that can
synthesize high-quality cross-id person images for person search tasks. In
order to facilitate the feature learning of the GAN-based Scene Synthesis
model, we adopt an online learning strategy that collaboratively learns the
synthesized images and original images. Extensive experiments on two widely
used person search benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, have shown that our method
has achieved great performance, and the extensive ablation study further
justifies our GAN-synthetic data can effectively increase the variability of
the datasets and be more realistic.

<p class="mathjax">Unlike human beings that can employ the entire surface of their limbs as a
means to establish contact with their environment, robots are typically
programmed to interact with their environments via their end-effectors, in a
collision-free fashion, to avoid damaging their environment. In a departure
from such a traditional approach, this work presents a contact-aware controller
for reference tracking that maintains interaction forces on the surface of the
robot below a safety threshold in the presence of both rigid and soft contacts.
Furthermore, we leveraged the proposed controller to extend the BiTRRT
sample-based planning method to be contact-aware, using a simplified contact
model. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated in hardware
experiments using a Franka robot in a setup inspired by the Amazon stowing
task. A demo video of our results can be seen here:

products, yet developers face challenges in transitioning from ML prototypes to
products. Academic researchers struggle to propose solutions to these
challenges and evaluate interventions because they often do not have access to
close-sourced ML products from industry. In this study, we define and identify
open-source ML products, curating a dataset of 262 repositories from GitHub, to
facilitate further research and education. As a start, we explore six broad
research questions related to different development activities and report 21
findings from a sample of 30 ML products from the dataset. Our findings reveal
a variety of development practices and architectural decisions surrounding
different types and uses of ML models that offer ample opportunities for future
research innovations. We also find very little evidence of industry best
practices such as model testing and pipeline automation within the open-source
ML products, which leaves room for further investigation to understand its
potential impact on the development and eventual end-user experience for the
products.

<p class="mathjax">Interface problems have long been a major focus of scientific computing,
leading to the development of various numerical methods. Traditional mesh-based
methods often employ time-consuming body-fitted meshes with standard
discretization schemes or unfitted meshes with tailored schemes to achieve
controllable accuracy and convergence rate. Along another line, mesh-free
methods bypass mesh generation but lack robustness in terms of convergence and
accuracy due to the low regularity of solutions. In this study, we propose a
novel method for solving interface problems within the framework of the random
feature method. This approach utilizes random feature functions in conjunction
with a partition of unity as approximation functions. It evaluates partial
differential equations, boundary conditions, and interface conditions on
collocation points in equal footing, and solves a linear least-squares system
to obtain the approximate solution. To address the issue of low regularity, two
sets of random feature functions are used to approximate the solution on each
side of the interface, which are then coupled together via interface
conditions. We validate our method through a series of increasingly complex
numerical examples. Our findings show that despite the solution often being
only continuous or even discontinuous, our method not only eliminates the need
for mesh generation but also maintains high accuracy, akin to the spectral
collocation method for smooth solutions. Remarkably, for the same accuracy
requirement, our method requires two to three orders of magnitude fewer degrees
of freedom than traditional methods, demonstrating its significant potential
for solving interface problems with complex geometries.

<p class="mathjax">Existing approaches to distributed matrix computations involve allocating
coded combinations of submatrices to worker nodes, to build resilience to
stragglers and/or enhance privacy. In this study, we consider the challenge of
preserving input sparsity in such approaches to retain the associated
computational efficiency enhancements. First, we find a lower bound on the
weight of coding, i.e., the number of submatrices to be combined to obtain
coded submatrices to provide the resilience to the maximum possible number of
stragglers (for given number of nodes and their storage constraints). Next we
propose a distributed matrix computation scheme which meets this exact lower
bound on the weight of the coding. Further, we develop controllable trade-off
between worker computation time and the privacy constraint for sparse input
matrices in settings where the worker nodes are honest but curious. Numerical
experiments conducted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) validate our assertions
regarding straggler mitigation and computation speed for sparse matrices.

<p class="mathjax">To use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in practical
applications, it is crucial to learn reward models from diverse sources of
human feedback and to consider human factors involved in providing feedback of
different types. However, the systematic study of learning from diverse types
of feedback is held back by limited standardized tooling available to
researchers. To bridge this gap, we propose RLHF-Blender, a configurable,
interactive interface for learning from human feedback. RLHF-Blender provides a
modular experimentation framework and implementation that enables researchers
to systematically investigate the properties and qualities of human feedback
for reward learning. The system facilitates the exploration of various feedback
types, including demonstrations, rankings, comparisons, and natural language
instructions, as well as studies considering the impact of human factors on
their effectiveness. We discuss a set of concrete research opportunities
enabled by RLHF-Blender. More information is available at

<p class="mathjax">Can an AI win Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ)? That is the
question we seek to answer in the NSMQ AI project, an open-source project that
is building AI to compete live in the NSMQ and win. The NSMQ is an annual live
science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in
Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across
biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages
until a winning team is crowned for that year. The NSMQ is an exciting live
quiz competition with interesting technical challenges across speech-to-text,
text-to-speech, question-answering, and human-computer interaction. In this
ongoing work that began in January 2023, we give an overview of the project,
describe each of the teams, progress made thus far, and the next steps toward
our planned launch and debut of the AI in October for NSMQ 2023. An AI that
conquers this grand challenge can have real-world impact on education such as
enabling millions of students across Africa to have one-on-one learning support
from this AI.

<p class="mathjax">We present a rigorous and precise analysis of the maximum degree and the
average degree in a dynamic duplication-divergence graph model introduced by
Sol\'e, Pastor-Satorras et al. in which the graph grows according to a
duplication-divergence mechanism, i.e. by iteratively creating a copy of some
node and then randomly alternating the neighborhood of a new node with
probability $p$. This model captures the growth of some real-world processes
e.g. biological or social networks.
<br />In this paper, we prove that for some $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$ the maximum degree and the
average degree of a duplication-divergence graph on $t$ vertices are
asymptotically concentrated with high probability around $t^p$ and $\max\{t^{2
p - 1}, 1\}$, respectively, i.e. they are within at most a polylogarithmic
factor from these values with probability at least $1 - t^{-A}$ for any
constant $A &gt; 0$.

<p class="mathjax">The abundant biodiversity of coral reefs in Indonesian waters is a valuable
asset that needs to be preserved. Rapid climate change and uncontrolled human
activities have led to the degradation of coral reef ecosystems, including
coral bleaching, which is a critical indicator of coral health conditions.
Therefore, this research aims to develop an accurate classification model to
distinguish between healthy corals and corals experiencing bleaching. This
study utilizes a specialized dataset consisting of 923 images collected from
Flickr using the Flickr API. The dataset comprises two distinct classes:
healthy corals (438 images) and bleached corals (485 images). These images have
been resized to a maximum of 300 pixels in width or height, whichever is
larger, to maintain consistent sizes across the dataset.
<br />The method employed in this research involves the use of machine learning
models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), to recognize and
differentiate visual patterns associated with healthy and bleached corals. In
this context, the dataset can be used to train and test various classification
models to achieve optimal results. By leveraging the ResNet model, it was found
that a from-scratch ResNet model can outperform pretrained models in terms of
precision and accuracy. The success in developing accurate classification
models will greatly benefit researchers and marine biologists in gaining a
better understanding of coral reef health. These models can also be employed to
monitor changes in the coral reef environment, thereby making a significant
contribution to conservation and ecosystem restoration efforts that have
far-reaching impacts on life.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a lightweight and accurate face detection algorithm
LAFD (Light and accurate face detection) based on Retinaface. Backbone network
in the algorithm is a modified MobileNetV3 network which adjusts the size of
the convolution kernel, the channel expansion multiplier of the inverted
residuals block and the use of the SE attention mechanism. Deformable
convolution network(DCN) is introduced in the context module and the algorithm
uses focal loss function instead of cross-entropy loss function as the
classification loss function of the model. The test results on the WIDERFACE
dataset indicate that the average accuracy of LAFD is 94.1%, 92.2% and 82.1%
for the "easy", "medium" and "hard" validation subsets respectively with an
improvement of 3.4%, 4.0% and 8.3% compared to Retinaface and 3.1%, 4.1% and
4.1% higher than the well-performing lightweight model, LFFD. If the input
image is pre-processed and scaled to 1560px in length or 1200px in width, the
model achieves an average accuracy of 86.2% on the 'hard' validation subset.
The model is lightweight, with a size of only 10.2MB.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models are increasingly utilized across impactful domains to
predict individual outcomes. As such, many models provide algorithmic recourse
to individuals who receive negative outcomes. However, recourse can be
leveraged by adversaries to disclose private information. This work presents
the first attempt at mitigating such attacks. We present two novel methods to
generate differentially private recourse: Differentially Private Model (DPM)
and Laplace Recourse (LR). Using logistic regression classifiers and real world
and synthetic datasets, we find that DPM and LR perform well in reducing what
an adversary can infer, especially at low FPR. When training dataset size is
large enough, we find particular success in preventing privacy leakage while
maintaining model and recourse accuracy with our novel LR method.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing cross-modal retrieval methods employ two-stream encoders with
different architectures for images and texts, \textit{e.g.}, CNN for images and
RNN/Transformer for texts. Such discrepancy in architectures may induce
different semantic distribution spaces and limit the interactions between
images and texts, and further result in inferior alignment between images and
texts. To fill this research gap, inspired by recent advances of Transformers
in vision tasks, we propose to unify the encoder architectures with
Transformers for both modalities. Specifically, we design a cross-modal
retrieval framework purely based on two-stream Transformers, dubbed
\textbf{Hierarchical Alignment Transformers (HAT)}, which consists of an image
Transformer, a text Transformer, and a hierarchical alignment module. With such
identical architectures, the encoders could produce representations with more
similar characteristics for images and texts, and make the interactions and
alignments between them much easier. Besides, to leverage the rich semantics,
we devise a hierarchical alignment scheme to explore multi-level
correspondences of different layers between images and texts. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed HAT, we conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Experimental results demonstrate that
HAT outperforms SOTA baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on two key
tasks, \textit{i.e.}, image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, HAT achieves
7.6\% and 16.7\% relative score improvement of Recall@1 on MSCOCO, and 4.4\%
and 11.6\% on Flickr30k respectively. The code is available at
\url{https://github.com/LuminosityX/HAT}.

<p class="mathjax">Cumulative and quadratic voting are two distributional voting methods that
are expressive, promoting fairness and inclusion, particularly in the realm of
participatory budgeting. Despite these benefits, graphical voter interfaces for
cumulative and quadratic voting are complex to implement and use effectively.
As a result, such methods have not seen yet widespread adoption on digital
voting platforms. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing an
implementation and evaluation of cumulative and quadratic voting within a
state-of-the-art voting platform: Stanford Participatory Budgeting. The
findings of the study show that while voters prefer simple methods, the more
expressive (and complex) cumulative voting becomes the preferred one compared
to k-ranking voting that is simpler but less expressive. The implemented voting
interface elements are found useful and support the observed voters'
preferences for more expressive voting methods. *

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the potential for nationality biases in natural language
processing (NLP) models using human evaluation methods. Biased NLP models can
perpetuate stereotypes and lead to algorithmic discrimination, posing a
significant challenge to the fairness and justice of AI systems. Our study
employs a two-step mixed-methods approach that includes both quantitative and
qualitative analysis to identify and understand the impact of nationality bias
in a text generation model. Through our human-centered quantitative analysis,
we measure the extent of nationality bias in articles generated by AI sources.
We then conduct open-ended interviews with participants, performing qualitative
coding and thematic analysis to understand the implications of these biases on
human readers. Our findings reveal that biased NLP models tend to replicate and
amplify existing societal biases, which can translate to harm if used in a
sociotechnical setting. The qualitative analysis from our interviews offers
insights into the experience readers have when encountering such articles,
highlighting the potential to shift a reader's perception of a country. These
findings emphasize the critical role of public perception in shaping AI's
impact on society and the need to correct biases in AI systems.

<p class="mathjax">3D vision-language grounding (3D-VL) is an emerging field that aims to
connect the 3D physical world with natural language, which is crucial for
achieving embodied intelligence. Current 3D-VL models rely heavily on
sophisticated modules, auxiliary losses, and optimization tricks, which calls
for a simple and unified model. In this paper, we propose 3D-VisTA, a
pre-trained Transformer for 3D Vision and Text Alignment that can be easily
adapted to various downstream tasks. 3D-VisTA simply utilizes self-attention
layers for both single-modal modeling and multi-modal fusion without any
sophisticated task-specific design. To further enhance its performance on 3D-VL
tasks, we construct ScanScribe, the first large-scale 3D scene-text pairs
dataset for 3D-VL pre-training. ScanScribe contains 2,995 RGB-D scans for 1,185
unique indoor scenes originating from ScanNet and 3R-Scan datasets, along with
paired 278K scene descriptions generated from existing 3D-VL tasks, templates,
and GPT-3. 3D-VisTA is pre-trained on ScanScribe via masked language/object
modeling and scene-text matching. It achieves state-of-the-art results on
various 3D-VL tasks, ranging from visual grounding and dense captioning to
question answering and situated reasoning. Moreover, 3D-VisTA demonstrates
superior data efficiency, obtaining strong performance even with limited
annotations during downstream task fine-tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic segmentation of knee bony anatomy is essential in orthopedics, and
it has been around for several years in both pre-operative and post-operative
settings. While deep learning algorithms have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical image analysis, the assessment of fairness and potential
biases within these models remains limited. This study aims to revisit deep
learning-powered knee-bony anatomy segmentation using plain radiographs to
uncover visible gender and racial biases. The current contribution offers the
potential to advance our understanding of biases, and it provides practical
insights for researchers and practitioners in medical imaging. The proposed
mitigation strategies mitigate gender and racial biases, ensuring fair and
unbiased segmentation results. Furthermore, this work promotes equal access to
accurate diagnoses and treatment outcomes for diverse patient populations,
fostering equitable and inclusive healthcare provision.

<p class="mathjax">Event camera-based pattern recognition is a newly arising research topic in
recent years. Current researchers usually transform the event streams into
images, graphs, or voxels, and adopt deep neural networks for event-based
classification. Although good performance can be achieved on simple event
recognition datasets, however, their results may be still limited due to the
following two issues. Firstly, they adopt spatial sparse event streams for
recognition only, which may fail to capture the color and detailed texture
information well. Secondly, they adopt either Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for
energy-efficient recognition with suboptimal results, or Artificial Neural
Networks (ANN) for energy-intensive, high-performance recognition. However,
seldom of them consider achieving a balance between these two aspects. In this
paper, we formally propose to recognize patterns by fusing RGB frames and event
streams simultaneously and propose a new RGB frame-event recognition framework
to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed method contains four main
modules, i.e., memory support Transformer network for RGB frame encoding,
spiking neural network for raw event stream encoding, multi-modal bottleneck
fusion module for RGB-Event feature aggregation, and prediction head. Due to
the scarce of RGB-Event based classification dataset, we also propose a
large-scale PokerEvent dataset which contains 114 classes, and 27102
frame-event pairs recorded using a DVS346 event camera. Extensive experiments
on two RGB-Event based classification datasets fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed framework. We hope this work will boost the
development of pattern recognition by fusing RGB frames and event streams. Both
our dataset and source code of this work will be released at
https://github.com/Event-AHU/SSTFormer.

<p class="mathjax">Super Resolution (SR) and Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) are two hot
topics in computer vision with various joint applications. For instance,
low-resolution surveillance images can be successively processed by
super-resolution techniques and camouflaged object detection. However, in
previous work, these two areas are always studied in isolation. In this paper,
we, for the first time, conduct an integrated comparative evaluation for both.
Specifically, we benchmark different super-resolution methods on commonly used
COD datasets, and meanwhile, we evaluate the robustness of different COD models
by using COD data processed by SR methods. Our goal is to bridge these two
domains, discover novel experimental phenomena, summarize new experim.

<p class="mathjax">While language models are powerful and versatile, they often fail to address
highly complex problems. This is because solving complex problems requires
deliberate thinking, which has been only minimally guided during training. In
this paper, we propose a new method called Cumulative Reasoning (CR), which
employs language models in a cumulative and iterative manner to emulate human
thought processes. By decomposing tasks into smaller components, \ournameb
streamlines the problem-solving process, rendering it both more manageable and
effective. For logical inference tasks, CR consistently outperforms existing
methods with an improvement up to 9.3\%, and achieves the astonishing accuracy
of 98.04\% on the curated FOLIO wiki dataset. In the context of the Game of 24,
CR achieves an accuracy of 94\%, which signifies a substantial enhancement of
20\% over the previous state-of-the-art method.

<p class="mathjax">Argument graphs provide an abstract representation of an argumentative
situation. A bipolar argument graph is a directed graph where each node denotes
an argument, and each arc denotes the influence of one argument on another.
Here we assume that the influence is supporting, attacking, or ambiguous. In a
bipolar argument graph, each argument is atomic and so it has no internal
structure. Yet to better understand the nature of the individual arguments, and
how they interact, it is important to consider their internal structure. To
address this need, this paper presents a framework based on the use of logical
arguments to instantiate bipolar argument graphs, and a set of possible
constraints on instantiating arguments that take into account the internal
structure of the arguments, and the types of relationship between arguments.

<p class="mathjax">The main premise of federated learning is that machine learning model updates
are computed locally, in particular to preserve user data privacy, as those
never leave the perimeter of their device. This mechanism supposes the general
model, once aggregated, to be broadcast to collaborating and non malicious
nodes. However, without proper defenses, compromised clients can easily probe
the model inside their local memory in search of adversarial examples. For
instance, considering image-based applications, adversarial examples consist of
imperceptibly perturbed images (to the human eye) misclassified by the local
model, which can be later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to
replicate the attack. To mitigate such malicious probing, we introduce Pelta, a
novel shielding mechanism leveraging trusted hardware. By harnessing the
capabilities of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Pelta masks part of the
back-propagation chain rule, otherwise typically exploited by attackers for the
design of malicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on a state of the art ensemble
model and demonstrate its effectiveness against the Self Attention Gradient
adversarial Attack.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being considered to assist human
decision-making in high-stake domains (e.g. health). However, researchers have
discussed an issue that humans can over-rely on wrong suggestions of the AI
model instead of achieving human AI complementary performance. In this work, we
utilized salient feature explanations along with what-if, counterfactual
explanations to make humans review AI suggestions more analytically to reduce
overreliance on AI and explored the effect of these explanations on trust and
reliance on AI during clinical decision-making. We conducted an experiment with
seven therapists and ten laypersons on the task of assessing post-stroke
survivors' quality of motion, and analyzed their performance, agreement level
on the task, and reliance on AI without and with two types of AI explanations.
Our results showed that the AI model with both salient features and
counterfactual explanations assisted therapists and laypersons to improve their
performance and agreement level on the task when `right' AI outputs are
presented. While both therapists and laypersons over-relied on `wrong' AI
outputs, counterfactual explanations assisted both therapists and laypersons to
reduce their over-reliance on `wrong' AI outputs by 21\% compared to salient
feature explanations. Specifically, laypersons had higher performance degrades
by 18.0 f1-score with salient feature explanations and 14.0 f1-score with
counterfactual explanations than therapists with performance degrades of 8.6
and 2.8 f1-scores respectively. Our work discusses the potential of
counterfactual explanations to better estimate the accuracy of an AI model and
reduce over-reliance on `wrong' AI outputs and implications for improving
human-AI collaborative decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Open data is receiving increased attention and support in academic
environments, with one justification being that shared data may be re-used in
further research. But what evidence exists for such re-use, and what is the
relationship between the producers of shared datasets and researchers who use
them? Using a sample of data citations from OpenAlex, this study investigates
the relationship between creators and citers of datasets at the individual,
institutional, and national levels. We find that the vast majority of datasets
have no recorded citations, and that most cited datasets only have a single
citation. Rates of self-citation by individuals and institutions tend towards
the low end of previous findings and vary widely across disciplines. At the
country level, the United States is by far the most prominent exporter of
re-used datasets, while importation is more evenly distributed. Understanding
where and how the sharing of data between researchers, institutions, and
countries takes place is essential to developing open research practices.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing image-text matching methods adopt triplet loss as the
optimization objective, and choosing a proper negative sample for the triplet
of &lt;anchor, positive, negative&gt; is important for effectively training the
model, e.g., hard negatives make the model learn efficiently and effectively.
However, we observe that existing methods mainly employ the most similar
samples as hard negatives, which may not be true negatives. In other words, the
samples with high similarity but not paired with the anchor may reserve
positive semantic associations, and we call them false negatives. Repelling
these false negatives in triplet loss would mislead the semantic representation
learning and result in inferior retrieval performance. In this paper, we
propose a novel False Negative Elimination (FNE) strategy to select negatives
via sampling, which could alleviate the problem introduced by false negatives.
Specifically, we first construct the distributions of positive and negative
samples separately via their similarities with the anchor, based on the
features extracted from image and text encoders. Then we calculate the false
negative probability of a given sample based on its similarity with the anchor
and the above distributions via the Bayes' rule, which is employed as the
sampling weight during negative sampling process. Since there may not exist any
false negative in a small batch size, we design a memory module with momentum
to retain a large negative buffer and implement our negative sampling strategy
spanning over the buffer. In addition, to make the model focus on hard
negatives, we reassign the sampling weights for the simple negatives with a
cut-down strategy. The extensive experiments are conducted on Flickr30K and
MS-COCO, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed false
negative elimination strategy. The code is available at
https://github.com/LuminosityX/FNE.

<p class="mathjax">Point clouds are naturally sparse, while image pixels are dense. The
inconsistency limits feature fusion from both modalities for point-wise scene
flow estimation. Previous methods rarely predict scene flow from the entire
point clouds of the scene with one-time inference due to the memory
inefficiency and heavy overhead from distance calculation and sorting involved
in commonly used farthest point sampling, KNN, and ball query algorithms for
local feature aggregation. To mitigate these issues in scene flow learning, we
regularize raw points to a dense format by storing 3D coordinates in 2D grids.
Unlike the sampling operation commonly used in existing works, the dense 2D
representation 1) preserves most points in the given scene, 2) brings in a
significant boost of efficiency, and 3) eliminates the density gap between
points and pixels, allowing us to perform effective feature fusion. We also
present a novel warping projection technique to alleviate the information loss
problem resulting from the fact that multiple points could be mapped into one
grid during projection when computing cost volume. Sufficient experiments
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, outperforming the
prior-arts on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting level sets from scalar data is a fundamental operation in
visualization with many applications. Recently, the concept of level set
extraction has been extended to bivariate scalar fields. Prior work on vector
field equivalence, wherein an analyst marks a region in the domain and is shown
other regions in the domain with similar vector values, pointed out the need to
make this extraction operation fast, so that analysts can work interactively.
To date, the fast extraction of level sets from bivariate scalar fields has not
been researched as extensively as for the univariate case. In this paper, we
present a novel algorithm that extracts fiber lines, i.e., the preimages of so
called control polygons (FSCP), for bivariate 2D data by joint traversal of
bounding volume hierarchies for both grid and FSCP elements. We performed an
extensive evaluation, comparing our method to a two-dimensional adaptation of
the method proposed by Klacansky et al., as well as to the naive approach for
fiber line extraction. The evaluation incorporates a vast array of
configurations in several datasets. We found that our method provides a speedup
of several orders of magnitudes compared to the naive algorithm and requires
two thirds of the computation time compared to Klacansky et al. adapted for 2D.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of tactile data encodings using
swell paper in comparison to visual encodings displayed with SVGs for data
perception tasks. By replicating and adapting Cleveland and McGill's graphical
perception study for the tactile modality, we establish a novel tactile
encoding hierarchy. In a study with 12 university students, we found that
participants perceived visual encodings more accurately when comparing values,
judging their ratios with lower cognitive load, and better self-evaluated
performance than tactile encodings. However, tactile encodings differed from
their visual counterparts in terms of how accurately values could be decoded
from them. This suggests that data physicalizations will require different
design guidance than that developed for visual encodings. By providing
empirical evidence for the perceptual accuracy of tactile encodings, our work
contributes to foundational research on forms of data representation that
prioritize tactile perception such as tactile graphics.

<p class="mathjax">One aim of Process Mining (PM) is the discovery of process models from event
logs of information systems. PM has been successfully applied to
process-oriented enterprise systems but is less suited for communication- and
document-oriented Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS). ECS event logs are
very fine-granular and PM applied to their logs results in spaghetti models. A
common solution for this is event abstraction, i.e., converting low-level logs
into more abstract high-level logs before running discovery algorithms. ECS
logs come with special characteristics that have so far not been fully
addressed by existing event abstraction approaches. We aim to close this gap
with a tailored ECS event abstraction (ECSEA) approach that trains a model by
comparing recorded actual user activities (high-level traces) with the
system-generated low-level traces (extracted from the ECS). The model allows us
to automatically convert future low-level traces into an abstracted high-level
log that can be used for PM. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm produces
accurate results. ECSEA is a preprocessing method that is essential for the
interpretation of collaborative work activity in ECS, which we call Social
Process Mining.

<p class="mathjax">Lake extraction from remote sensing imagery is challenging due to the complex
shapes of lakes and the presence of noise. Existing methods suffer from blurred
segmentation boundaries and poor foreground modeling. In this paper, we propose
a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, called LEFormer, for accurate lake
extraction. LEFormer contains four main modules: CNN encoder, Transformer
encoder, cross-encoder fusion, and lightweight decoder. The CNN encoder
recovers local spatial information and improves fine-scale details.
Simultaneously, the Transformer encoder captures long-range dependencies
between sequences of any length, allowing them to obtain global features and
context information better. Finally, a lightweight decoder is employed for mask
prediction. We evaluate the performance and efficiency of LEFormer on two
datasets, the Surface Water (SW) and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Lake (QTPL).
Experimental results show that LEFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance and efficiency on these two datasets, outperforming existing
methods. Specifically, LEFormer achieves 90.86% and 97.42% mIoU on the SW and
QTPL datasets with a parameter count of 3.61M, respectively, while being 20x
minor than the previous SOTA method.

<p class="mathjax">Major advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
increasingly take the form of developing and releasing general-purpose models.
These models are designed to be adapted by other businesses and agencies to
perform a particular, domain-specific function. This process has become known
as adaptation or fine-tuning. This paper offers a model of the fine-tuning
process where a Generalist brings the technological product (here an ML model)
to a certain level of performance, and one or more Domain-specialist(s) adapts
it for use in a particular domain. Both entities are profit-seeking and incur
costs when they invest in the technology, and they must reach a bargaining
agreement on how to share the revenue for the technology to reach the market.
For a relatively general class of cost and revenue functions, we characterize
the conditions under which the fine-tuning game yields a profit-sharing
solution. We observe that any potential domain-specialization will either
contribute, free-ride, or abstain in their uptake of the technology, and we
provide conditions yielding these different strategies. We show how methods
based on bargaining solutions and sub-game perfect equilibria provide insights
into the strategic behavior of firms in these types of interactions, and we
find that profit-sharing can still arise even when one firm has significantly
higher costs than another. We also provide methods for identifying
Pareto-optimal bargaining arrangements for a general set of utility functions.

<p class="mathjax">Wide-scale use of visual surveillance in public spaces puts individual
privacy at stake while increasing resource consumption (energy, bandwidth, and
computation). Neuromorphic vision sensors (event-cameras) have been recently
considered a valid solution to the privacy issue because they do not capture
detailed RGB visual information of the subjects in the scene. However, recent
deep learning architectures have been able to reconstruct images from event
cameras with high fidelity, reintroducing a potential threat to privacy for
event-based vision applications. In this paper, we aim to anonymize
event-streams to protect the identity of human subjects against such image
reconstruction attacks. To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end network
architecture jointly optimized for the twofold objective of preserving privacy
and performing a downstream task such as person ReId. Our network learns to
scramble events, enforcing the degradation of images recovered from the privacy
attacker. In this work, we also bring to the community the first ever
event-based person ReId dataset gathered to evaluate the performance of our
approach. We validate our approach with extensive experiments and report
results on the synthetic event data simulated from the publicly available
SoftBio dataset and our proposed Event-ReId dataset.

<p class="mathjax">These days with the rising computational capabilities of wireless user
equipment such as smart phones, tablets, and vehicles, along with growing
concerns about sharing private data, a novel machine learning model called
federated learning (FL) has emerged. FL enables the separation of data
acquisition and computation at the central unit, which is different from
centralized learning that occurs in a data center. FL is typically used in a
wireless edge network where communication resources are limited and unreliable.
Bandwidth constraints necessitate scheduling only a subset of UEs for updates
in each iteration, and because the wireless medium is shared, transmissions are
susceptible to interference and are not assured. The article discusses the
significance of Machine Learning in wireless communication and highlights
Federated Learning (FL) as a novel approach that could play a vital role in
future mobile networks, particularly 6G and beyond.

<p class="mathjax">Backdoor attacks pose a significant security risk to graph learning models.
Backdoors can be embedded into the target model by inserting backdoor triggers
into the training dataset, causing the model to make incorrect predictions when
the trigger is present. To counter backdoor attacks, backdoor detection has
been proposed. An emerging detection strategy in the vision and NLP domains is
based on an intriguing phenomenon: when training models on a mixture of
backdoor and clean samples, the loss on backdoor samples drops significantly
faster than on clean samples, allowing backdoor samples to be easily detected
by selecting samples with the lowest loss values. However, the ignorance of
topological feature information on graph data limits its detection
effectiveness when applied directly to the graph domain. To this end, we
propose an explanation-guided backdoor detection method to take advantage of
the topological information. Specifically, we train a helper model on the graph
dataset, feed graph samples into the model, and then adopt explanation methods
to attribute model prediction to an important subgraph. We observe that
backdoor samples have distinct attribution distribution than clean samples, so
the explanatory subgraph could serve as more discriminative features for
detecting backdoor samples. Comprehensive experiments on multiple popular
datasets and attack methods demonstrate the effectiveness and explainability of
our method. Our code is available:

energy consumption and resource wastage. In this paper, we aim to re-purpose
the energy by replacing the hash function with real-life problems having
commercial utility. We propose Chrisimos, a useful Proof-of-Work where miners
are required to find a minimal dominating set for real-life graph instances. A
miner who is able to output the smallest dominating set for the given graph
within the block interval time wins the mining game. We also propose a new

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a highly performant 3D object detector for point clouds using
the DETR framework. The prior attempts all end up with suboptimal results
because they fail to learn accurate inductive biases from the limited scale of
training data. In particular, the queries often attend to points that are far
away from the target objects, violating the locality principle in object
detection. To address the limitation, we introduce a novel 3D Vertex Relative
Position Encoding (3DV-RPE) method which computes position encoding for each
point based on its relative position to the 3D boxes predicted by the queries
in each decoder layer, thus providing clear information to guide the model to
focus on points near the objects, in accordance with the principle of locality.
In addition, we systematically improve the pipeline from various aspects such
as data normalization based on our understanding of the task. We show
exceptional results on the challenging ScanNetV2 benchmark, achieving
significant improvements over the previous 3DETR in
$\rm{AP}_{25}$/$\rm{AP}_{50}$ from 65.0\%/47.0\% to 77.8\%/66.0\%,
respectively. In addition, our method sets a new record on ScanNetV2 and SUN

<p class="mathjax">Designing models that are both expressive and preserve known invariances of
tasks is an increasingly hard problem. Existing solutions tradeoff invariance
for computational or memory resources. In this work, we show how to leverage
randomness and design models that are both expressive and invariant but use
less resources. Inspired by randomized algorithms, our key insight is that
accepting probabilistic notions of universal approximation and invariance can
reduce our resource requirements. More specifically, we propose a class of
binary classification models called Randomized Linear Classifiers (RLCs). We
give parameter and sample size conditions in which RLCs can, with high
probability, approximate any (smooth) function while preserving invariance to
compact group transformations. Leveraging this result, we design three RLCs
that are provably probabilistic invariant for classification tasks over sets,
graphs, and spherical data. We show how these models can achieve probabilistic
invariance and universality using less resources than (deterministic) neural
networks and their invariant counterparts. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
the benefits of this new class of models on invariant tasks where deterministic
invariant neural networks are known to struggle.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated impressive performance in
vision and graphics tasks, such as novel view synthesis and immersive reality.
However, the shape-radiance ambiguity of radiance fields remains a challenge,
especially in the sparse viewpoints setting. Recent work resorts to integrating
depth priors into outdoor NeRF training to alleviate the issue. However, the
criteria for selecting depth priors and the relative merits of different priors
have not been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the relative merits of
selecting different approaches to use the depth priors is also an unexplored
problem. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study and evaluation of
employing depth priors to outdoor neural radiance fields, covering common depth
sensing technologies and most application ways. Specifically, we conduct
extensive experiments with two representative NeRF methods equipped with four
commonly-used depth priors and different depth usages on two widely used
outdoor datasets. Our experimental results reveal several interesting findings
that can potentially benefit practitioners and researchers in training their
NeRF models with depth priors. Project Page:

<p class="mathjax">We present some initial results of a large-scale Italian project called
PRODIGIT which aims to support tax judges and lawyers through digital
technology, focusing on AI. We have focused on generation of summaries of
judicial decisions and on the extraction of related information, such as the
identification of legal issues and decision-making criteria, and the
specification of keywords. To this end, we have deployed and evaluated
different tools and approaches to extractive and abstractive summarisation. We
have applied LLMs, and particularly on GPT4, which has enabled us to obtain
results that proved satisfactory, according to an evaluation by expert tax
judges and lawyers. On this basis, a prototype application is being built which
will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Optical satellite images are a critical data source; however, cloud cover
often compromises their quality, hindering image applications and analysis.
Consequently, effectively removing clouds from optical satellite images has
emerged as a prominent research direction. While recent advancements in cloud
removal primarily rely on generative adversarial networks, which may yield
suboptimal image quality, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in diverse image-generation tasks, showcasing their potential in addressing
this challenge. This paper presents a novel framework called DiffCR, which
leverages conditional guided diffusion with deep convolutional networks for
high-performance cloud removal for optical satellite imagery. Specifically, we
introduce a decoupled encoder for conditional image feature extraction,
providing a robust color representation to ensure the close similarity of
appearance information between the conditional input and the synthesized
output. Moreover, we propose a novel and efficient time and condition fusion
block within the cloud removal model to accurately simulate the correspondence
between the appearance in the conditional image and the target image at a low
computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations on two commonly used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiffCR consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on all metrics, with parameter and computational
complexities amounting to only 5.1% and 5.4%, respectively, of those previous
best methods. The source code, pre-trained models, and all the experimental
results will be publicly available at https://github.com/XavierJiezou/DiffCR
upon the paper's acceptance of this work.

<p class="mathjax">Near-field mobile terahertz (THz) communications is one of the candidate
enablers for high-rate wireless data exchange in sixth-generation (6G)
networks. However, operating in the THz near field brings both attractive
opportunities and severe challenges. Hence, it becomes of interest to explore
if it is possible to design a realistic mobile THz communication system without
working in the THz near field. To answer this question, a mathematical
framework is presented modeling a mobile THz link that works exclusively in the
far field. The study leads to an interesting theoretical conclusion: while the
actual frequency is of (almost) no interest, such a system must operate over a
limited bandwidth not exceeding a certain threshold. It is then numerically
shown that operating only in the far field imposes stringent limitations on
mobile THz communications, thus making them less attractive to prospective
high-rate services. In contrast, it is shown that a stationary THz link can
still be broadband even when staying exclusively in the THz far field. Hence,
broadband mobile THz communications MUST be near-field, while broadband
stationary THz links do not have to.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most enticing research areas is the stock market, and projecting
stock prices may help investors profit by making the best decisions at the
correct time. Deep learning strategies have emerged as a critical technique in
the field of the financial market. The stock market is impacted due to two
aspects, one is the geo-political, social and global events on the bases of
which the price trends could be affected. Meanwhile, the second aspect purely
focuses on historical price trends and seasonality, allowing us to forecast
stock prices. In this paper, our aim is to focus on the second aspect and build
a model that predicts future prices with minimal errors. In order to provide
better prediction results of stock price, we propose a new model named Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Sequential Self-Attention Mechanism (LSTM-SSAM).
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the three stock datasets: SBIN,
HDFCBANK, and BANKBARODA. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and
feasibility of the proposed model compared to existing models. The experimental
findings demonstrate that the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and R-square (R2)
evaluation indicators are giving the best results.

<p class="mathjax">The joint task of Dialog Sentiment Classification (DSC) and Act Recognition
(DAR) aims to predict the sentiment label and act label for each utterance in a
dialog simultaneously. However, current methods encode the dialog context in
only one direction, which limits their ability to thoroughly comprehend the
context. Moreover, these methods overlook the explicit correlations between
sentiment and act labels, which leads to an insufficient ability to capture
rich sentiment and act clues and hinders effective and accurate reasoning. To
address these issues, we propose a Bi-directional Multi-hop Inference Model
(BMIM) that leverages a feature selection network and a bi-directional
multi-hop inference network to iteratively extract and integrate rich sentiment
and act clues in a bi-directional manner. We also employ contrastive learning
and dual learning to explicitly model the correlations of sentiment and act
labels. Our experiments on two widely-used datasets show that BMIM outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by at least 2.6% on F1 score in DAR and 1.4% on F1
score in DSC. Additionally, Our proposed model not only improves the
performance but also enhances the interpretability of the joint sentiment and
act prediction task.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate detection of natural deterioration and man-made damage on the
surfaces of ancient stele in the first instance is essential for their
preventive conservation. Existing methods for cultural heritage preservation
are not able to achieve this goal perfectly due to the difficulty of balancing
accuracy, efficiency, timeliness, and cost. This paper presents a deep-learning
method to automatically detect above mentioned emergencies on ancient stone
stele in real time, employing autoencoder (AE) and generative adversarial
network (GAN). The proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing
methods by requiring no extensive anomaly samples while enabling comprehensive
detection of unpredictable anomalies. the method includes stages of monitoring,
data acquisition, pre-processing, model structuring, and post-processing.
Taking the Longmen Grottoes' stone steles as a case study, an unsupervised
learning model based on AE and GAN architectures is proposed and validated with
a reconstruction accuracy of 99.74\%. The method's evaluation revealed the
proficient detection of seven artificially designed anomalies and demonstrated
precision and reliability without false alarms. This research provides novel
ideas and possibilities for the application of deep learning in the field of
cultural heritage.

<p class="mathjax">The legality of training language models (LMs) on copyrighted or otherwise
restricted data is under intense debate. However, as we show, model performance
significantly degrades if trained only on low-risk text (e.g., out-of-copyright
books or government documents), due to its limited size and domain coverage. We
present SILO, a new language model that manages this risk-performance tradeoff
during inference. SILO is built by (1) training a parametric LM on Open License
Corpus (OLC), a new corpus we curate with 228B tokens of public domain and
permissively licensed text and (2) augmenting it with a more general and easily
modifiable nonparametric datastore (e.g., containing copyrighted books or news)
that is only queried during inference. The datastore allows use of high-risk
data without training on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and
enables data producers to opt out from the model by removing content from the
store. These capabilities can foster compliance with data-use regulations such
as the fair use doctrine in the United States and the GDPR in the European
Union. Our experiments show that the parametric LM struggles on domains not
covered by OLC. However, access to the datastore greatly improves out of domain
performance, closing 90% of the performance gap with an LM trained on the Pile,
a more diverse corpus with mostly high-risk text. We also analyze which
nonparametric approach works best, where the remaining errors lie, and how
performance scales with datastore size. Our results suggest that it is possible
to build high quality language models while mitigating their legal risk.

<p class="mathjax">In machine learning, incorporating more data is often seen as a reliable
strategy for improving model performance; this work challenges that notion by
demonstrating that the addition of external datasets in many cases can hurt the
resulting model's performance. In a large-scale empirical study across
combinations of four different open-source chest x-ray datasets and 9 different
labels, we demonstrate that in 43% of settings, a model trained on data from
two hospitals has poorer worst group accuracy over both hospitals than a model
trained on just a single hospital's data. This surprising result occurs even
though the added hospital makes the training distribution more similar to the
test distribution. We explain that this phenomenon arises from the spurious
correlation that emerges between the disease and hospital, due to
hospital-specific image artifacts. We highlight the trade-off one encounters
when training on multiple datasets, between the obvious benefit of additional
data and insidious cost of the introduced spurious correlation. In some cases,
balancing the dataset can remove the spurious correlation and improve
performance, but it is not always an effective strategy. We contextualize our
results within the literature on spurious correlations to help explain these
outcomes. Our experiments underscore the importance of exercising caution when
selecting training data for machine learning models, especially in settings
where there is a risk of spurious correlations such as with medical imaging.
The risks outlined highlight the need for careful data selection and model
evaluation in future research and practice.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have
paved the way for unprecedented opportunities for understanding the complexity
of the brain and its emulation by computational systems. Cutting-edge
advancements in neuroscience research have revealed the intricate relationship
between brain structure and function, while the success of artificial neural
networks highlights the importance of network architecture. Now is the time to
bring them together to better unravel how intelligence emerges from the brain's
multiscale repositories. In this review, we propose the Digital Twin Brain
(DTB) as a transformative platform that bridges the gap between biological and
artificial intelligence. It consists of three core elements: the brain
structure that is fundamental to the twinning process, bottom-layer models to
generate brain functions, and its wide spectrum of applications. Crucially,
brain atlases provide a vital constraint, preserving the brain's network
organization within the DTB. Furthermore, we highlight open questions that
invite joint efforts from interdisciplinary fields and emphasize the
far-reaching implications of the DTB. The DTB can offer unprecedented insights
into the emergence of intelligence and neurological disorders, which holds
tremendous promise for advancing our understanding of both biological and
artificial intelligence, and ultimately propelling the development of
artificial general intelligence and facilitating precision mental healthcare.

<p class="mathjax">Proximal gradient-based optimization is one of the most common strategies for
solving image inverse problems as well as easy to implement. However, these
techniques often generate heavy artifacts in image reconstruction. One of the
most popular refinement methods is to fine-tune the regularization parameter to
alleviate such artifacts, but it may not always be sufficient or applicable due
to increased computational costs. In this work, we propose a deep geometric
incremental learning framework based on second Nesterov proximal gradient
optimization. The proposed end-to-end network not only has the powerful
learning ability for high/low frequency image features,but also can
theoretically guarantee that geometric texture details will be reconstructed
from preliminary linear reconstruction.Furthermore, it can avoid the risk of
intermediate reconstruction results falling outside the geometric decomposition
domains and achieve fast convergence. Our reconstruction framework is
decomposed into four modules including general linear reconstruction, cascade
geometric incremental restoration, Nesterov acceleration and post-processing.
In the image restoration step,a cascade geometric incremental learning module
is designed to compensate for the missing texture information from different
geometric spectral decomposition domains. Inspired by overlap-tile strategy, we
also develop a post-processing module to remove the block-effect in
patch-wise-based natural image reconstruction. All parameters in the proposed
model are learnable,an adaptive initialization technique of physical-parameters
is also employed to make model flexibility and ensure converging smoothly. We
compare the reconstruction performance of the proposed method with existing
state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority. Our source codes are

<p class="mathjax">Bilevel optimization has become a powerful tool in a wide variety of machine
learning problems. However, the current nonconvex bilevel optimization
considers an offline dataset and static functions, which may not work well in
emerging online applications with streaming data and time-varying functions. In
this work, we study online bilevel optimization (OBO) where the functions can
be time-varying and the agent continuously updates the decisions with online
streaming data. To deal with the function variations and the unavailability of
the true hypergradients in OBO, we propose a single-loop online bilevel
optimizer with window averaging (SOBOW), which updates the outer-level decision
based on a window average of the most recent hypergradient estimations stored
in the memory. Compared to existing algorithms, SOBOW is computationally
efficient and does not need to know previous functions. To handle the unique
technical difficulties rooted in single-loop update and function variations for
OBO, we develop a novel analytical technique that disentangles the complex
couplings between decision variables, and carefully controls the hypergradient
estimation error. We show that SOBOW can achieve a sublinear bilevel local
regret under mild conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple domains
corroborate the effectiveness of SOBOW.

<p class="mathjax">Each year thousands of people suffer from various types of cranial injuries
and require personalized implants whose manual design is expensive and
time-consuming. Therefore, an automatic, dedicated system to increase the
availability of personalized cranial reconstruction is highly desirable. The
problem of the automatic cranial defect reconstruction can be formulated as the
shape completion task and solved using dedicated deep networks. Currently, the
most common approach is to use the volumetric representation and apply deep
networks dedicated to image segmentation. However, this approach has several
limitations and does not scale well into high-resolution volumes, nor takes
into account the data sparsity. In our work, we reformulate the problem into a
point cloud completion task. We propose an iterative, transformer-based method
to reconstruct the cranial defect at any resolution while also being fast and
resource-efficient during training and inference. We compare the proposed
methods to the state-of-the-art volumetric approaches and show superior
performance in terms of GPU memory consumption while maintaining high-quality
of the reconstructed defects.

<p class="mathjax">Inverse imaging problems that are ill-posed can be encountered across
multiple domains of science and technology, ranging from medical diagnosis to
astronomical studies. To reconstruct images from incomplete and distorted data,
it is necessary to create algorithms that can take into account both, the
physical mechanisms responsible for generating these measurements and the
intrinsic characteristics of the images being analyzed. In this work, the
sparse representation of images is reviewed, which is a realistic, compact and
effective generative model for natural images inspired by the visual system of
mammals. It enables us to address ill-posed linear inverse problems by training
the model on a vast collection of images. Moreover, we extend the application
of sparse coding to solve the non-linear and ill-posed problem in microwave
tomography imaging, which could lead to a significant improvement of the
state-of-the-arts algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">The recovery of morphologically accurate anatomical images from deformed ones
is challenging in ultrasound (US) image acquisition, but crucial to accurate
and consistent diagnosis, particularly in the emerging field of
computer-assisted diagnosis. This article presents a novel anatomy-aware
deformation correction approach based on a coarse-to-fine, multi-scale deep
neural network (DefCor-Net). To achieve pixel-wise performance, DefCor-Net
incorporates biomedical knowledge by estimating pixel-wise stiffness online
using a U-shaped feature extractor. The deformation field is then computed
using polynomial regression by integrating the measured force applied by the US
probe. Based on real-time estimation of pixel-by-pixel tissue properties, the
learning-based approach enables the potential for anatomy-aware deformation
correction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DefCor-Net, images
recorded at multiple locations on forearms and upper arms of six volunteers are
used to train and validate DefCor-Net. The results demonstrate that DefCor-Net
can significantly improve the accuracy of deformation correction to recover the
original geometry (Dice Coefficient: from $14.3\pm20.9$ to $82.6\pm12.1$ when
the force is $6N$).

<p class="mathjax">The accurate tracking of live cells using video microscopy recordings remains
a challenging task for popular state-of-the-art image processing based object
tracking methods. In recent years, several existing and new applications have
attempted to integrate deep-learning based frameworks for this task, but most
of them still heavily rely on consecutive frame based tracking embedded in
their architecture or other premises that hinder generalized learning. To
address this issue, we aimed to develop a new deep-learning based tracking
method that relies solely on the assumption that cells can be tracked based on
their spatio-temporal neighborhood, without restricting it to consecutive
frames. The proposed method has the additional benefit that the motion patterns
of the cells can be learned completely by the predictor without any prior
assumptions, and it has the potential to handle a large number of video frames
with heavy artifacts. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated
through multiple biologically motivated validation strategies and compared
against several state-of-the-art cell tracking methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for a
field-mediated interconnection of a quantum plant with a coherent
(measurement-free) quantum controller. The plant and the controller are
multimode open quantum harmonic oscillators governed by linear quantum
stochastic differential equations, which are coupled to each other and driven
by multichannel quantum Wiener processes modelling the external bosonic fields.
The control objective is to internally stabilize the closed-loop system and
minimize the infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rate of a quadratic-exponential
functional which penalizes the plant variables and the controller output. We
obtain first-order necessary conditions of optimality for this problem by
computing the partial Frechet derivatives of the cost functional with respect
to the energy and coupling matrices of the controller in frequency domain and
state space. An infinitesimal equivalence between the risk-sensitive and
weighted coherent quantum LQG control problems is also established. In addition
to variational methods, we employ spectral factorizations and infinite cascades
of auxiliary classical systems. Their truncations are applicable to numerical
optimization algorithms (such as the gradient descent) for coherent quantum
risk-sensitive feedback synthesis.

<p class="mathjax">Vortex-dominated flows are ubiquitous in engineering, and the ability to
efficiently manipulate the dynamics of these vortices has broad applications,
from wake shaping to mixing enhancement. However, the strongly nonlinear
behavior of the vortex dynamics makes this a challenging task. In this work, we
investigate the control of vortex dynamics by using a change of coordinates
from the Biot-Savart equations into well-known invariants, such as the
Hamiltonian, linear, and angular impulses, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. We
then combine the resulting model with model predictive control to generate
control laws that force the vortex system using "virtual cylinders". The
invariant model is beneficial as it provides a linear, global description of
the vortex dynamics through a recently developed Koopman control scheme for
conserved quantities and invariants. The use of this model has not been well
studied in the literature in the context of control. In this paper, we seek to
understand the effect of changing each invariant individually or multiple
invariants simultaneously. We use the 4-vortex system as our primary test bed,
as it is the simplest configuration that exhibits chaotic behavior. We show
that by controlling to specific invariant quantities, we can modify the
transition from chaotic to quasiperiodic states. Finally, we computationally
demonstrate the effectiveness of invariant control on a toy example of tracer
mixing in the 4-vortex system.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion model-based speech enhancement has received increased attention
since it can generate very natural enhanced signals and generalizes well to
unseen conditions. Diffusion models have been explored for several sub-tasks of
speech enhancement, such as speech denoising, dereverberation, and source
separation. In this paper, we investigate their use for target speech
extraction (TSE), which consists of estimating the clean speech signal of a
target speaker in a mixture of multi-talkers. TSE is realized by conditioning
the extraction process on a clue identifying the target speaker. We show we can
realize TSE using a conditional diffusion model conditioned on the clue.
Besides, we introduce ensemble inference to reduce potential extraction errors
caused by the diffusion process. In experiments on Libri2mix corpus, we show
that the proposed diffusion model-based TSE combined with ensemble inference
outperforms a comparable TSE system trained discriminatively.

<p class="mathjax">Our work presents a novel approach to shape optimization, that has the
twofold objective to improve the efficiency of global optimization algorithms
while promoting the generation of high-quality designs during the optimization
process free of geometrical anomalies. This is accomplished by reducing the
number of the original design variables defining a new reduced subspace where
the geometrical variance is maximized and modeling the underlying generative
process of the data via probabilistic linear latent variable models such as
Factor Analysis and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis. We show that
the data follows approximately a Gaussian distribution when the shape
modification method is linear and the design variables are sampled uniformly at
random, due to the direct application of the central limit theorem. The model
uncertainty is measured in terms of Mahalanobis distance, and the paper
demonstrates that anomalous designs tend to exhibit a high value of this
metric. This enables the definition of a new optimization model where anomalous
geometries are penalized and consequently avoided during the optimization loop.
The procedure is demonstrated for hull shape optimization of the DTMB 5415
model, extensively used as an international benchmark for shape optimization
problems. The global optimization routine is carried out using Bayesian
Optimization and the DIRECT algorithm. From the numerical results, the new
framework improves the convergence of global optimization algorithms, while
only designs with high-quality geometrical features are generated through the
optimization routine thereby avoiding the wastage of precious computationally
expensive simulations.

<p class="mathjax">The combination of clinical judgement and predictive risk models crucially
assist social workers to segregate children at risk of maltreatment and decide
when authorities should intervene. Predictive risk modelling to address this
matter has been initiated by several governmental welfare authorities worldwide
involving administrative data and machine learning algorithms. While previous
studies have investigated risk factors relating to child maltreatment, several
gaps remain as to understanding how such risk factors interact and whether
predictive risk models perform differently for children with different
features. By integrating Principal Component Analysis and K-Means clustering,
this paper presents initial findings of our work on the identification of such
features as well as their potential effect on current risk modelling
frameworks. This approach allows examining existent, unidentified yet, clusters
of New Zealand (NZ) children reported with care and protection concerns, as
well as to analyse their inner structure, and evaluate the performance of
prediction models trained cluster wise. We aim to discover the extent of
clustering degree required as an early step in the development of predictive
risk models for child maltreatment and so enhance the accuracy of such models
intended for use by child protection authorities. The results from testing
LASSO logistic regression models trained on identified clusters revealed no
significant difference in their performance. The models, however, performed
slightly better for two clusters including younger children. our results
suggest that separate models might need to be developed for children of certain
age to gain additional control over the error rates and to improve model
accuracy. While results are promising, more evidence is needed to draw
definitive conclusions, and further investigation is necessary.

system dynamics is unknown, but we assume we are able to observe its evolution
for a given control input, as typical in a Reinforcement Learning framework. We
propose an algorithm based on the idea to control and identify on the fly the
unknown system configuration. In this work, the control is based on the
State-Dependent Riccati approach, whereas the identification of the model on
Bayesian linear regression. At each iteration, based on the observed data, we
obtain an estimate of the a-priori unknown parameter configuration of the PDE
and then we compute the control of the correspondent model. We show by
numerical evidence the convergence of the method for infinite horizon control
problems.

<p class="mathjax">Benchmarking of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms is challenging due
to the complexity and variability of QML systems, e.g., regarding model
ansatzes, data sets, training techniques, and hyper-parameters selection. The
QUantum computing Application benchmaRK (QUARK) framework simplifies and
standardizes benchmarking studies for quantum computing applications. Here, we
propose several extensions of QUARK to include the ability to evaluate the
training and deployment of quantum generative models. We describe the updated
software architecture and illustrate its flexibility through several example
applications: (1) We trained different quantum generative models using several
circuit ansatzes, data sets, and data transformations. (2) We evaluated our
models on GPU and real quantum hardware. (3) We assessed the generalization
capabilities of our generative models using a broad set of metrics that
capture, e.g., the novelty and validity of the generated data.

<p class="mathjax">The combination of high-throughput experimentation techniques and machine
learning (ML) has recently ushered in a new era of accelerated material
discovery, enabling the identification of materials with cutting-edge
properties. However, the measurement of certain physical quantities remains
challenging to automate. Specifically, meticulous process control,
experimentation and laborious measurements are required to achieve optimal
electrical conductivity in doped polymer materials. We propose a ML approach,
which relies on readily measured absorbance spectra, to accelerate the workflow
associated with measuring electrical conductivity. The first ML model
(classification model), accurately classifies samples with a conductivity &gt;~25
to 100 S/cm, achieving a maximum of 100% accuracy rate. For the subset of
highly conductive samples, we employed a second ML model (regression model), to
predict their conductivities, yielding an impressive test R2 value of 0.984. To
validate the approach, we showed that the models, neither trained on the
samples with the two highest conductivities of 498 and 506 S/cm, were able to,
in an extrapolative manner, correctly classify and predict them at satisfactory
levels of errors. The proposed ML workflow results in an improvement in the
efficiency of the conductivity measurements by 89% of the maximum achievable
using our experimental techniques. Furthermore, our approach addressed the
common challenge of the lack of explainability in ML models by exploiting
bespoke mathematical properties of the descriptors and ML model, allowing us to
gain corroborated insights into the spectral influences on conductivity.
Through this study, we offer an accelerated pathway for optimizing the
properties of doped polymer materials while showcasing the valuable insights
that can be derived from purposeful utilization of ML in experimental science.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most exciting applications of AI is automated scientific discovery
based on previously amassed data, coupled with restrictions provided by the
known physical principles, including symmetries and conservation laws. Such
automated hypothesis creation and verification can assist scientists in
studying complex phenomena, where traditional physical intuition may fail. Of
particular importance are complex dynamic systems where their time evolution is
strongly influenced by varying external parameters. In this paper we develop a
platform based on a generalised Onsager principle to learn macroscopic
dynamical descriptions of arbitrary stochastic dissipative systems directly
from observations of their microscopic trajectories. We focus on systems whose
complexity and sheer sizes render complete microscopic description impractical,
and constructing theoretical macroscopic models requires extensive domain
knowledge or trial-and-error. Our machine learning approach addresses this by
simultaneously constructing reduced thermodynamic coordinates and interpreting
the dynamics on these coordinates. We demonstrate our method by studying
theoretically and validating experimentally, the stretching of long polymer
chains in an externally applied field. Specifically, we learn three
interpretable thermodynamic coordinates and build a dynamical landscape of
polymer stretching, including (1) the identification of stable and transition
states and (2) the control of the stretching rate. We further demonstrate the
universality of our approach by applying it to an unrelated problem in a
different domain: constructing macroscopic dynamics for spatial epidemics,
showing that our method addresses wide scientific and technological
applications.

be dependent on age and exhibit varying effects with their associated risk
factors. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for dynamic modeling of
the associations between health outcomes and risk factors using
varying-coefficients (VC) regional quantile regression via K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) fused Lasso, which captures the time-varying effects of age. The proposed
method has strong theoretical properties, including a tight estimation error

<p class="mathjax">While a traditional camera only captures one point of view of a scene, a
plenoptic or light-field camera, is able to capture spatial and angular
information in a single snapshot, enabling depth estimation from a single
acquisition. In this paper, we present a new metric depth estimation algorithm
using only raw images from a multi-focus plenoptic camera. The proposed
approach is especially suited for the multi-focus configuration where several
micro-lenses with different focal lengths are used. The main goal of our blur
aware depth estimation (BLADE) approach is to improve disparity estimation for
defocus stereo images by integrating both correspondence and defocus cues. We
thus leverage blur information where it was previously considered a drawback.
We explicitly derive an inverse projection model including the defocus blur
providing depth estimates up to a scale factor. A method to calibrate the
inverse model is then proposed. We thus take into account depth scaling to
achieve precise and accurate metric depth estimates. Our results show that
introducing defocus cues improves the depth estimation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework and depth scaling calibration on relative depth
estimation setups and on real-world 3D complex scenes with ground truth
acquired with a 3D lidar scanner.

descriptions into a shared audio-caption space in which related examples from

the self-attention-based audio encoder for audio embedding and the utilization
of additional human-generated and synthetic data sets during pre-training. We
further experimented with augmenting ClothoV2 captions with available keywords
to increase their variety; however, this only led to marginal improvements. Our

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have emerged as viable alternatives to convolutional neural
networks owing to their ability to learn non-local region relationships in the
spatial domain. The self-attention mechanism of the transformer enables
transformers to capture long-range dependencies in the images, which might be
desirable for accelerated MRI image reconstruction as the effect of
undersampling is non-local in the image domain. Despite its computational
efficiency, the window-based transformers suffer from restricted receptive
fields as the dependencies are limited to within the scope of the image
windows. We propose a window-based transformer network that integrates dilated
attention mechanism and convolution for accelerated MRI image reconstruction.
The proposed network consists of dilated and dense neighborhood attention
transformers to enhance the distant neighborhood pixel relationship and
introduce depth-wise convolutions within the transformer module to learn
low-level translation invariant features for accelerated MRI image
reconstruction. The proposed model is trained in a self-supervised manner. We
perform extensive experiments for multi-coil MRI acceleration for coronal PD,
coronal PDFS and axial T2 contrasts with 4x and 5x under-sampling in
self-supervised learning based on k-space splitting. We compare our method
against other reconstruction architectures and the parallel domain
self-supervised learning baseline. Results show that the proposed model
exhibits improvement margins of (i) around 1.40 dB in PSNR and around 0.028 in
SSIM on average over other architectures (ii) around 1.44 dB in PSNR and around
0.029 in SSIM over parallel domain self-supervised learning. The code is

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we consider a covert communication scenario, where a
transmitter Alice communicates to a receiver Bob with the aid of a
probabilistic and uninformed jammer against an adversary warden's detection.
The transmission status and power of the jammer are random and follow some
priori probabilities. We first analyze the warden's detection performance as a
function of the jammer's transmission probability, transmit power distribution,
and Alice's transmit power. We then maximize the covert throughput from Alice
to Bob subject to a covertness constraint, by designing the covert
communication strategies from three different perspectives: Alice's
perspective, the jammer's perspective, and the global perspective. Our analysis
reveals that the minimum jamming power should not always be zero in the
probabilistic jamming strategy, which is different from that in the continuous
jamming strategy presented in the literature. In addition, we prove that the
minimum jamming power should be the same as Alice's covert transmit power,
depending on the covertness and average jamming power constraints. Furthermore,
our results show that the probabilistic jamming can outperform the continuous
jamming in terms of achieving a higher covert throughput under the same
covertness and average jamming power constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems typically use handcrafted feature
extraction pipelines. To avoid their inherent information loss and to achieve
more consistent modeling from speech to transcribed text, neural raw waveform
feature extractors (FEs) are an appealing approach. Also the wav2vec 2.0 model,
which has recently gained large popularity, uses a convolutional FE which
operates directly on the speech waveform. However, it is not yet studied
extensively in the literature. In this work, we study its capability to replace
the standard feature extraction methods in a connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) ASR model and compare it to an alternative neural FE. We
show that both are competitive with traditional FEs on the LibriSpeech
benchmark and analyze the effect of the individual components. Furthermore, we
analyze the learned filters and show that the most important information for
the ASR system is obtained by a set of bandpass filters.

<p class="mathjax">Power grid, communications, computer and product reticulation networks are
frequently layered or subdivided by design. The layering divides
responsibilities and can be driven by operational, commercial, regulatory and
privacy concerns. From a control context, a layer, or part of a layer, in a
network isolates the authority to manage, i.e. control, a dynamic system with
connections into unknown parts of the network. The topology of these
connections is fully prescribed but the interconnecting signals, currents in
the case of power grids and bandwidths in communications, are largely
unavailable, through lack of sensing and even prohibition. Accordingly, one is
driven to simultaneous input and state estimation methods. We study a class of
algorithms for this joint task, which has the unfortunate issue of inverting a
subsystem, which if it has unstable transmission zeros leads to an unstable and
unimplementable estimator. Two modifications to the algorithm to ameliorate
this problem were recently proposed involving replacing the troublesome
subsystem with its outer factor from its inner-outer factorization or using a
high-variance white signal model for the unknown inputs. Here, we establish the
connections between the original estimation problem for state and input signal
and the estimates from the algorithm applied solely to the outer factor. It is
demonstrated that the state of the outer factor and that of the original system
asymptotically coincide and that the estimate of the input signal to the outer
factor has asymptotically stationary second-order statistics which are in
one-to-one correspondence with those of the input signal to the original
system, when this signal is itself stationary. Thus, the simultaneous input and
state estimation algorithm applied just to the outer factor yields an unbiased
state estimate for control and the statistics of the interface signals.

<p class="mathjax">We present a practical and effective method for rigorously estimating
quantities associated to top eigenvalues of transfer operators to very high
precision. The method combines explicit error bounds of the Lagrange-Chebyshev
approximation with an established min-max method. We illustrate its
applicability by significantly improving rigorous estimates on various ergodic
quantities associated to the Bolyai-R\'enyi map.

<p class="mathjax">The topological (resp. geodesic) complexity of a topological (resp. metric)
space is roughly the smallest number of continuous rules required to choose
paths (resp. shortest paths) between any points of the space. We prove that the
geodesic complexity of a cube exceeds its topological complexity by exactly 2.
The proof involves a careful analysis of cut loci of the cube.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel low-cost method to predict: i) the vascular age
of a healthy young person, ii) whether or not a person is a smoker, using only
the lead-I of the electrocardiogram (ECG). We begin by collecting (lead-I) ECG
data from 42 healthy subjects (male, female, smoker, non-smoker) aged 18 to 30
years, using our custom-built low-cost single-lead ECG module, and
anthropometric data, e.g., body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure etc.
Under our proposed method, we first pre-process our dataset by denoising the
ECG traces, followed by baseline drift removal, followed by z-score
normalization. Next, we divide ECG traces into overlapping segments of
five-second duration, which leads to a 145-fold increase in the size of the
dataset. We then feed our dataset to a number of machine learning models, a 1D
convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and ResNet18
transfer learning model. For vascular ageing prediction problem, Random Forest
method outperforms all other methods with an R2 score of 0.99, and mean squared
error of 0.07. For the binary classification problem that aims to differentiate
between a smoker and a non-smoker, XGBoost method stands out with an accuracy
of 96.5%. Finally, for the 4-class classification problem that aims to
differentiate between male smoker, female smoker, male non-smoker, and female
non-smoker, MLP method achieves the best accuracy of 97.5%. This work is
aligned with the sustainable development goals of the United Nations which aim
to provide low-cost but quality healthcare solutions to the unprivileged
population.

<p class="mathjax">Causal inference is a crucial goal of science, enabling researchers to arrive
at meaningful conclusions regarding the predictions of hypothetical
interventions using observational data. Path models, Structural Equation Models
(SEMs), and, more generally, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), provide a means to
unambiguously specify assumptions regarding the causal structure underlying a
phenomenon. Unlike DAGs, which make very few assumptions about the functional
and parametric form, SEM assumes linearity. This can result in functional
misspecification which prevents researchers from undertaking reliable effect
size estimation. In contrast, we propose Super Learner Equation Modeling, a
path modeling technique integrating machine learning Super Learner ensembles.
We empirically demonstrate its ability to provide consistent and unbiased
estimates of causal effects, its competitive performance for linear models when
compared with SEM, and highlight its superiority over SEM when dealing with
non-linear relationships. We provide open-source code, and a tutorial notebook
with example usage, accentuating the easy-to-use nature of the method.

<p class="mathjax">The burning number of a graph $G$ is the smallest number $b$ such that the
vertices of $G$ can be covered by balls of radii $0, 1, \dots, b-1$. As
computing the burning number of a graph is known to be NP-hard, even on trees,
it is natural to consider polynomial time approximation algorithms for the
quantity. The best known approximation factor in the literature is $3$ for
general graphs and $2$ for trees. In this note we give a
$2/(1-e^{-2})+\varepsilon=2.313\dots$-approximation algorithm for the burning
number of general graphs, and a PTAS for the burning number of trees and
forests. Moreover, we show that computing a
$(\frac43-\varepsilon)$-approximation of the burning number of a general graph
$G$ is NP-hard.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based models in medical imaging often struggle to generalize
effectively to new scans due to data heterogeneity arising from differences in
hardware, acquisition parameters, population, and artifacts. This limitation
presents a significant challenge in adopting machine learning models for
clinical practice. We propose an unsupervised method for robust domain
adaptation in brain MRI segmentation by leveraging MRI-specific augmentation
techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, modalities, and segmentation tasks,
comparing against the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our
proposed approach achieves high accuracy, exhibits broad applicability, and
showcases remarkable robustness against domain shift in various tasks,
surpassing the state-of-the-art performance in the majority of cases.

<p class="mathjax">Reduced-order models have been widely adopted in fluid mechanics,
particularly in the context of Newtonian fluid flows. These models offer the
ability to predict complex dynamics, such as instabilities and oscillations, at
a considerably reduced computational cost. In contrast, the reduced-order
modeling of non-Newtonian viscoelastic fluid flows remains relatively
unexplored. This work leverages the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) algorithm to develop interpretable reduced-order models for a broad
class of viscoelastic flows. In particular, we explore a benchmark oscillatory
viscoelastic flow on the four-roll mill geometry using the classical Oldroyd-B
fluid. This flow exemplifies many canonical challenges associated with
non-Newtonian flows, including transitions, asymmetries, instabilities, and
bifurcations arising from the interplay of viscous and elastic forces, all of
which require expensive computations in order to resolve the fast timescales
and long transients characteristic of such flows. First, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our data-driven surrogate model in predicting the transient
evolution on a simplified representation of the dynamical system. We then
describe the ability of the reduced-order model to accurately reconstruct
spatial flow field in a basis obtained via proper orthogonal decomposition.
Finally, we develop a fully parametric, nonlinear model that captures the
dominant variations of the dynamics with the relevant nondimensional
Weissenberg number. This work illustrates the potential to reduce computational
costs and improve design, optimization, and control of a large class of
non-Newtonian fluid flows with modern machine learning and reduced-order
modeling techniques.

<p class="mathjax">A powerful concept behind much of the recent progress in machine learning is
the extraction of common features across data from heterogeneous sources or
tasks. Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation
function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by
leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward
theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of
recovering linear operators $M$ from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$,
where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We
demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic meta-learning approaches incur
biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise
terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn
can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked
by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\texttt{De-bias &amp;
Feature-Whiten}$ ($\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating
minimization-descent (AMD) scheme proposed in Collins et al., (2021), and
establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level
scaling down with the $\textit{total}$ source data size. This leads to
generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer.
We verify the vital importance of $\texttt{DFW}$ on various numerical
simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization
descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data. Our
analysis unifies and generalizes prior work, and provides a flexible framework
for a wider range of applications, such as in controls and dynamical systems.
