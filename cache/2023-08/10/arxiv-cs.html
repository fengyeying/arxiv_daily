<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on the creation of a new, publicly available Wi-Fi probe
request dataset. Probe requests belong to the family of management frames used
by the 802.11 (Wi-Fi) protocol. As the situation changes year by year, and
technology improves probe request studies are necessary to be done on
up-to-date data. We provide a month-long probe request capture in an office
environment, including work days, weekends, and holidays consisting of over 1
400 000 probe requests. We provide a description of all the important aspects
of the dataset. Apart from the raw packet capture we also provide a Radio Map
(RM) of the office to ensure the users of the dataset have all the possible
information about the environment. To protect privacy, user information in the
dataset is anonymized. This anonymization is done in a way that protects the
privacy of users while preserving the ability to analyze the dataset to almost
the same level as raw data. Furthermore, we showcase several possible use cases
for the dataset, like presence detection, temporal Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI) stability, and privacy protection evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence is bringing ever new functionalities to the realm of
mobile devices that are now considered essential (e.g., camera and voice
assistants, recommender systems). Yet, operating artificial intelligence takes
up a substantial amount of energy. However, artificial intelligence is also
being used to enable more energy-efficient solutions for mobile systems. Hence,
artificial intelligence has two faces in that regard, it is both a key enabler
of desired (efficient) mobile functionalities and a major power draw on these
devices, playing a part in both the solution and the problem. In this paper, we
present a review of the literature of the past decade on the usage of
artificial intelligence within the realm of green mobile computing. From the
analysis of 34 papers, we highlight the emerging patterns and map the field
into 13 main topics that are summarized in details.
<br />Our results showcase that the field is slowly increasing in the past years,
more specifically, since 2019. Regarding the double impact AI has on the mobile
energy consumption, the energy consumption of AI-based mobile systems is
under-studied in comparison to the usage of AI for energy-efficient mobile
computing, and we argue for more exploratory studies in that direction. We
observe that although most studies are framed as solution papers (94%), the
large majority do not make those solutions publicly available to the community.
Moreover, we also show that most contributions are purely academic (28 out of
34 papers) and that we need to promote the involvement of the mobile software
industry in this field.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, we study the privacy and security aspects of the metaverse
in the context of digital healthcare. Our studies include the security aspects
of data collection and communications for access to the metaverse, the privacy
and security threats of employing Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
(AI/ML) algorithms for metaverse healthcare, and the privacy of social
interactions among patients in the metaverse from a human-centric perspective.
In this article, we aim to provide new perspectives and less-investigated
solutions, which are shown to be promising mechanisms in the context of
wireless communications and computer science and can be considered novel
solutions to be applied to healthcare metaverse services. Topics include
physical layer security (PHYSec), Semantic Metaverse Communications (SMC),
Differential Privacy (DP), and Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). As a case
study, we propose distributed differential privacy for the metaverse healthcare
systems, where each virtual clinic perturbs its medical model vector to enhance
privacy against malicious actors and curious servers. Through our experiments
on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (BCWD), we highlight the privacy-utility
trade-off for different adjustable levels of privacy.

<p class="mathjax">Metaverse-enabled digital healthcare systems are expected to exploit an
unprecedented amount of personal health data, while ensuring that sensitive or
private information of individuals are not disclosed. Machine learning and
artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques can be widely utilized in metaverse
healthcare systems, such as virtual clinics and intelligent consultations. In
such scenarios, the key challenge is that data privacy laws might not allow
virtual clinics to share their medical data with other parties. Moreover,
clinical AI/ML models themselves carry extensive information about the medical
datasets, such that private attributes can be easily inferred by malicious
actors in the metaverse (if not rigorously privatized). In this paper, inspired
by the idea of "incognito mode", which has recently been developed as a
promising solution to safeguard metaverse users' privacy, we propose global
differential privacy for the distributed metaverse healthcare systems. In our
scheme, a randomized mechanism in the format of artificial "mix-up" noise is
applied to the federated clinical ML/AI models before sharing with other peers.
This way, we provide an adjustable level of distributed privacy against both
the malicious actors and honest-but curious metaverse servers. Our evaluations
on breast cancer Wisconsin dataset (BCWD) highlight the privacy-utility
trade-off (PUT) in terms of diagnosis accuracy and loss function for different
levels of privacy. We also compare our private scheme with the non-private
centralized setup in terms of diagnosis accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Does artificial intelligence (AI) pose existential risks to humanity? Some
critics feel this question is getting too much attention, and want to push it
aside in favour of conversations about the immediate risks of AI. These critics
now include the journal Nature, where a recent editorial urges us to 'stop
talking about tomorrow's AI doomsday when AI poses risks today.' We argue that
this is a serious failure of judgement, on Nature's part. In science, as in
everyday life, we expect influential actors to consider the consequences of
error. As the world's leading scientific journal, Nature is certainly an
influential actor, especially so in the absence of robust global regulation of
AI. Yet it has manifestly failed to consider the cost of error in this case.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning is a distributed mechanism that trained large-scale neural
network models with the participation of multiple clients and data remains on
their devices, only sharing the local model updates. With this feature,
federated learning is considered a secure solution for data privacy issues.
However, the typical FL structure relies on the client-server, which leads to
the single-point-of-failure (SPoF) attack, and the random selection of clients
for model training compromised the model accuracy. Furthermore, adversaries try
for inference attacks i.e., attack on privacy leads to gradient leakage
attacks. We proposed the blockchain-based optimized client selection and
privacy-preserved framework in this context. We designed the three kinds of
smart contracts such as 1) registration of clients 2) forward bidding to select
optimized clients for FL model training 3) payment settlement and reward smart
contracts. Moreover, fully homomorphic encryption with Cheon, Kim, Kim, and
Song (CKKS) method is implemented before transmitting the local model updates
to the server. Finally, we evaluated our proposed method on the benchmark
dataset and compared it with state-of-the-art studies. Consequently, we
achieved a higher accuracy rate and privacy-preserved FL framework with
decentralized nature.

<p class="mathjax">Online social media have become an important forum for exchanging political
opinions. In response to COVID measures citizens expressed their policy
preferences directly on these platforms. Quantifying political preferences in
online social media remains challenging: The vast amount of content requires
scalable automated extraction of political preferences -- however fine grained
political preference extraction is difficult with current machine learning (ML)
technology, due to the lack of data sets. Here we present a novel data set of
tweets with fine grained political preference annotations. A text
classification model trained on this data is used to extract policy preferences
in a German Twitter corpus ranging from 2019 to 2022. Our results indicate that
in response to the COVID pandemic, expression of political opinions increased.
Using a well established taxonomy of policy preferences we analyse fine grained
political views and highlight changes in distinct political categories. These
analyses suggest that the increase in policy preference expression is dominated
by the categories pro-welfare, pro-education and pro-governmental
administration efficiency. All training data and code used in this study are
made publicly available to encourage other researchers to further improve
automated policy preference extraction methods. We hope that our findings
contribute to a better understanding of political statements in online social
media and to a better assessment of how COVID measures impact political
preferences.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI, the most popular current approach to AI, consists of large
language models (LLMs) that are trained to produce outputs that are plausible,
but not necessarily correct. Although their abilities are often uncanny, they
are lacking in aspects of reasoning, leading LLMs to be less than completely
trustworthy. Furthermore, their results tend to be both unpredictable and
uninterpretable.
<br />We lay out 16 desiderata for future AI, and discuss an alternative approach
to AI which could theoretically address many of the limitations associated with
current approaches: AI educated with curated pieces of explicit knowledge and
rules of thumb, enabling an inference engine to automatically deduce the
logical entailments of all that knowledge. Even long arguments produced this
way can be both trustworthy and interpretable, since the full step-by-step line
of reasoning is always available, and for each step the provenance of the
knowledge used can be documented and audited. There is however a catch: if the
logical language is expressive enough to fully represent the meaning of
anything we can say in English, then the inference engine runs much too slowly.
That's why symbolic AI systems typically settle for some fast but much less
expressive logic, such as knowledge graphs. We describe how one AI system, Cyc,
has developed ways to overcome that tradeoff and is able to reason in higher
order logic in real time.
<br />We suggest that any trustworthy general AI will need to hybridize the
approaches, the LLM approach and more formal approach, and lay out a path to
realizing that dream.

<p class="mathjax">Automated driving functions (ADFs) have become increasingly popular in recent
years. However, their safety must be assured. Thus, the verification and
validation of these functions is still an important open issue in research and
development. To achieve this efficiently, scenario-based testing has been
established as a valuable methodology among researchers, industry, as well as
authorities. Simulations are a powerful way to test those scenarios
reproducibly. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically test a set of
scenarios in many variations. In contrast to related approaches, those
variations are not applied to traffic participants around the ADF, but to the
road network to show that parameters regarding the road topology also influence
the performance of such an ADF. We present a continuous tool chain to set up
scenarios, variate them, run simulations and finally, evaluate the performance
with a set of key performance indicators (KPIs).

welcoming and constitutes one of the major breakthroughs in the efforts made to
rejuvenate the global financial systems. However, like other information
technology IT based financial systems, the POS also poses some cybersecurity
security threats. The unique thing about the POS is that the main cybersecurity
threats it poses to most users are not IT based which refers to unauthorized
access and gaining information without the knowledge of the user. The threats
are rather connected to the mode of operation of POS kiosks, particularly as
experienced in most parts of Nigeria. The mode of operation exposes users cards
to possible cloning.

these risks, there is an urgent need of policies and regulations responsible
and ethical development in the field of generative AI. Existing and proposed
centralized regulations by governments to rein in AI face criticisms such as
not having sufficient clarity or uniformity, lack of interoperability across
lines of jurisdictions, restricting innovation, and hindering free market
competition. Decentralized protections via crowdsourced safety tools and
mechanisms are a potential alternative. However, they have clear deficiencies
in terms of lack of adequacy of oversight and difficulty of enforcement of
ethical and safety standards, and are thus not enough by themselves as a
regulation mechanism. We propose a marriage of these two strategies via a
framework we call Dual Governance. This framework proposes a cooperative
synergy between centralized government regulations in a U.S. specific context
and safety mechanisms developed by the community to protect stakeholders from
the harms of generative AI. By implementing the Dual Governance framework, we
posit that innovation and creativity can be promoted while ensuring safe and
ethical deployment of generative AI.

<p class="mathjax">There is debate over whether Asian American students are admitted to
selective colleges and universities at lower rates than white students with
similar academic qualifications. However, there have been few empirical
investigations of this issue, in large part due to a dearth of data. Here we
present the results from analyzing 685,709 applications from Asian American and
white students to a subset of selective U.S. institutions over five application
cycles, beginning with the 2015-2016 cycle. The dataset does not include
admissions decisions, and so we construct a proxy based in part on enrollment
choices. Based on this proxy, we estimate the odds that Asian American
applicants were admitted to at least one of the schools we consider were 28%
lower than the odds for white students with similar test scores, grade-point
averages, and extracurricular activities. The gap was particularly pronounced
for students of South Asian descent (49% lower odds). We trace this pattern in
part to two factors. First, many selective colleges openly give preference to
the children of alumni, and we find that white applicants were substantially
more likely to have such legacy status than Asian applicants, especially South
Asian applicants. Second, after adjusting for observed student characteristics,
the institutions we consider appear less likely to admit students from
geographic regions with relatively high shares of applicants who are Asian. We
hope these results inform ongoing discussions on the equity of college
admissions policies.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning prediction of electromagnetic software calculation results has
been a widely discussed issue in recent years. But the prediction accuracy was
still one of the challenges to be solved. In this work, we proposed that the
ResNets-10 model was used for predicting plasmonic metasurface S11 parameters.
The two-stage training was performed by the k-fold cross-validation and small
learning rate. After the training was completed, the prediction loss for
aluminum, gold, and silver metal-insulator-metal metasurfaces was -48.45,
-46.47, and -35.54, respectively. Due to the ultralow error value, the proposed
network can replace the traditional electromagnetic computing method for
calculation within a certain structural range. Besides, this network can finish
the training process less than 1,100 epochs. This means that the network
training process can effectively lower the design process time. The ResNets-10
model we proposed can also be used to design meta-diffractive devices and
biosensors, thereby reducing the time required for the calculation process. The
ultralow error of the network indicates that this work contributes to the
development of future artificial intelligence electromagnetic computing
software.

<p class="mathjax">In last two decades, messaging systems have gained widespread popularity both
in the enterprise and consumer sectors. Many of these systems used secure
protocols like end-to-end encryption to ensure strong security in one-to-one
communication. However, the majority of them rely on centralized servers, which
allows them to use their users' personal data. Also, it allows the government
to track and regulate their citizens' activities, which poses significant
threats to "digital freedom". Also, these systems have failed to achieve
security attributes like confidentiality, integrity, and privacy for group
communications. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based secure
messaging system named Quarks that overcomes the security pitfalls of the
existing systems and eliminates centralized control. We have analyzed our
architecture with security models to demonstrate the system's reliability and
usability. We have developed a Proof of Concept (PoC) of the Quarks system
leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and conducted load testing on
that. We noticed that our PoC system achieves all the desired attributes that
are prevalent in a traditional centralized messaging scheme despite the limited
capacity of the development and testing environment. Therefore, this assures us
of the applicability of such systems in the near future if scaled up properly.

<p class="mathjax">Although wide-scale integration of cloud services with myriad applications
increases quality of services (QoS) for enterprise users, verifying the
existence and manipulation of stored cloud information remains an open research
problem. Decentralized blockchain-based solutions are becoming more appealing
for cloud auditing environments because of the immutable nature of blockchain.
However, the decentralized structure of blockchain results in considerable
synchronization and communication overhead, which increases maintenance costs
for cloud service providers (CSP). This paper proposes a Merkle Hash Tree based
architecture named Entangled Merkle Forest to support version control and
dynamic auditing of information in centralized cloud environments. We utilized
a semi-trusted third-party auditor to conduct the auditing tasks with minimal
privacy-preserving file metadata. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to design a node sharing Merkle Forest to offer a cost-effective auditing
framework for centralized cloud infrastructures while achieving the immutable
feature of blockchain, mitigating the synchronization and performance
challenges of the decentralized architectures. Our proposed scheme outperforms
it's equivalent Blockchain-based schemes by ensuring time and storage
efficiency with minimum overhead as evidenced by performance analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Promoting sustainable transportation options is increasingly crucial in the
pursuit of environmentally friendly and efficient campus mobility systems.
Among these options, bike-sharing programs have garnered substantial attention
for their capacity to mitigate traffic congestion, decrease carbon emissions,
and enhance overall campus sustainability. However, improper selection of
bike-sharing sites has led to the growing problems of unsustainable practices
in campus, including the disorderly parking and indiscriminate placement of
bike-sharing. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sustainable
development-oriented campus bike-sharing site evaluation model integrating the
improved Delphi and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approaches. Fourteen
evaluation metrics are firstly selected from four dimensions: the user
features, implementation and usage characteristics of parking spots,
environmental sustainability, and social sustainability, through the
combination of expert experience and the improved Delphi method. Then, the
analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weight method are employed to
determine the weights of the evaluation indices, ensuring a robust and
objective assessment framework. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is
finally implemented to evaluate the quality of location selection. South Campus
of Henan Polytechnic University is selected as a case study using the proposed
evaluation system. This work contributes to the existing body of knowledge by
presenting a comprehensive location selection evaluation system for campus
bike-sharing, informed by the principles of sustainable development.

<p class="mathjax">The growing use of voice user interfaces has led to a surge in the collection
and storage of speech data. While data collection allows for the development of
efficient tools powering most speech services, it also poses serious privacy
issues for users as centralized storage makes private personal speech data
vulnerable to cyber threats. With the increasing use of voice-based digital
assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Google's Home, and Apple's Siri, and with the
increasing ease with which personal speech data can be collected, the risk of
malicious use of voice-cloning and speaker/gender/pathological/etc. recognition
has increased.
<br />This thesis proposes solutions for anonymizing speech and evaluating the
degree of the anonymization. In this work, anonymization refers to making
personal speech data unlinkable to an identity while maintaining the usefulness
(utility) of the speech signal (e.g., access to linguistic content). We start
by identifying several challenges that evaluation protocols need to consider to
evaluate the degree of privacy protection properly. We clarify how
anonymization systems must be configured for evaluation purposes and highlight
that many practical deployment configurations do not permit privacy evaluation.
Furthermore, we study and examine the most common voice conversion-based
anonymization system and identify its weak points before suggesting new methods
to overcome some limitations. We isolate all components of the anonymization
system to evaluate the degree of speaker PPI associated with each of them.
Then, we propose several transformation methods for each component to reduce as
much as possible speaker PPI while maintaining utility. We promote
anonymization algorithms based on quantization-based transformation as an
alternative to the most-used and well-known noise-based approach. Finally, we
endeavor a new attack method to invert anonymization.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in various fields, including
computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It can
unravel hidden patterns within large data sets and reveal unparalleled
insights, revolutionizing many industries and disciplines. However, machine and
deep learning models lack interpretability and limited domain-specific
knowledge, especially in applications such as physics and engineering.
Alternatively, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) techniques integrate
physics principles into data-driven models. By combining deep learning with
domain knowledge, PIML improves the generalization of the model, abidance by
the governing physical laws, and interpretability. This paper comprehensively
reviews PIML applications related to subsurface energy systems, mainly in the
oil and gas industry. The review highlights the successful utilization of PIML
for tasks such as seismic applications, reservoir simulation, hydrocarbons
production forecasting, and intelligent decision-making in the exploration and
production stages. Additionally, it demonstrates PIML's capabilities to
revolutionize the oil and gas industry and other emerging areas of interest,
such as carbon and hydrogen storage; and geothermal systems by providing more
accurate and reliable predictions for resource management and operational
efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">In this research, we investigate the possibility of applying a search
strategy to genetic algorithms to explore the entire genetic tree structure.
Several methods aid in performing tree searches; however, simpler algorithms
such as breadth-first, depth-first, and iterative techniques are
computation-heavy and often result in a long execution time. Adversarial
techniques are often the preferred mechanism when performing a probabilistic
search, yielding optimal results more quickly. The problem we are trying to
tackle in this paper is the optimization of neural networks using genetic
algorithms. Genetic algorithms (GA) form a tree of possible states and provide
a mechanism for rewards via the fitness function. Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) has proven to be an effective tree search strategy given states and
rewards; therefore, we will combine these approaches to optimally search for
the best result generated with genetic algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, multiple data-driven models based on machine learning for weather
forecasting have emerged. These models are highly competitive in terms of
accuracy compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. In
particular, the Pangu-Weather model, which is open source for non-commercial
use, has been validated for its forecasting performance by the European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and has recently been published in
the journal "Nature". In this paper, we evaluate the compatibility of the
Pangu-Weather model with several commonly used NWP operational analyses through
case studies. The results indicate that the Pangu-Weather model is compatible
with different operational analyses from various NWP systems as the model
initial conditions, and it exhibits a relatively stable forecasting capability.
Furthermore, we have verified that improving the quality of global or local
initial conditions significantly contributes to enhancing the forecasting
performance of the Pangu-Weather model.

<p class="mathjax">Balance assessment during physical rehabilitation often relies on
rubric-oriented battery tests to score a patient's physical capabilities,
leading to subjectivity. While some objective balance assessments exist, they
are often limited to tracking the center of pressure (COP), which does not
fully capture the whole-body postural stability. This study explores the use of
the center of mass (COM) state space and presents a promising avenue for
monitoring the balance capabilities in humans. We employ a musculoskeletal
model integrated with a balance controller, trained through reinforcement
learning (RL), to investigate balancing capabilities. The RL framework consists
of two interconnected neural networks governing balance recovery and muscle
coordination respectively, trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with reference state initialization, early termination, and multiple training
strategies. By exploring recovery from random initial COM states (position and
velocity) space for a trained controller, we obtain the final BR enclosing
successful balance recovery trajectories. Comparing the BRs with analytical
postural stability limits from a linear inverted pendulum model, we observe a
similar trend in successful COM states but more limited ranges in the
recoverable areas. We further investigate the effect of muscle weakness and
neural excitation delay on the BRs, revealing reduced balancing capability in
different regions. Overall, our approach of learning muscular balance
controllers presents a promising new method for establishing balance recovery
limits and objectively assessing balance capability in bipedal systems,
particularly in humans.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) has been widely deployed to enable machine learning
training on sensitive data across distributed devices. However, the
decentralized learning paradigm and heterogeneity of FL further extend the
attack surface for backdoor attacks. Existing FL attack and defense
methodologies typically focus on the whole model. None of them recognizes the
existence of backdoor-critical (BC) layers-a small subset of layers that
dominate the model vulnerabilities. Attacking the BC layers achieves equivalent
effects as attacking the whole model but at a far smaller chance of being
detected by state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses. This paper proposes a general
in-situ approach that identifies and verifies BC layers from the perspective of
attackers. Based on the identified BC layers, we carefully craft a new backdoor
attack methodology that adaptively seeks a fundamental balance between
attacking effects and stealthiness under various defense strategies. Extensive
experiments show that our BC layer-aware backdoor attacks can successfully
backdoor FL under seven SOTA defenses with only 10% malicious clients and
outperform the latest backdoor attack methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL)-based RF fingerprinting (RFFP) technology has emerged as a
powerful physical-layer security mechanism, enabling device identification and
authentication based on unique device-specific signatures that can be extracted
from the received RF signals. However, DL-based RFFP methods face major
challenges concerning their ability to adapt to domain (e.g., day/time,
location, channel, etc.) changes and variability. This work proposes a novel IQ
data representation and feature design, termed Double-Sided Envelope Power
Spectrum or EPS, that is proven to overcome the domain adaptation problems
significantly. By accurately capturing device hardware impairments while
suppressing irrelevant domain information, EPS offers improved feature
selection for DL models in RFFP. Experimental evaluations demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving over 99% testing accuracy in same-day/channel/location
evaluations and 93% accuracy in cross-day evaluations, outperforming the
traditional IQ representation. Additionally, EPS excels in cross-location
evaluations, achieving a 95% accuracy. The proposed representation
significantly enhances the robustness and generalizability of DL-based RFFP
methods, thereby presenting a transformative solution to IQ data-based device
fingerprinting.

<p class="mathjax">Guided synthesis of high-quality 3D scenes is a challenging task. Diffusion
models have shown promise in generating diverse data, including 3D scenes.
However, current methods rely directly on text embeddings for controlling the
generation, limiting the incorporation of complex spatial relationships between
objects. We propose a novel approach for 3D scene diffusion guidance using
scene graphs. To leverage the relative spatial information the scene graphs
provide, we make use of relational graph convolutional blocks within our
denoising network. We show that our approach significantly improves the
alignment between scene description and generated scene.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a new aspect for determining the rank of the
unimportant filters for filter pruning on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
In the human synaptic system, there are two important channels known as
excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters that transmit a signal from a
neuron to a cell. Adopting the neuroscientific perspective, we propose a
synapse-inspired filter pruning method, namely Dynamic Score (D-Score). D-Score
analyzes the independent importance of positive and negative weights in the
filters and ranks the independent importance by assigning scores. Filters
having low overall scores, and thus low impact on the accuracy of neural
networks are pruned. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by reducing notable
amounts of FLOPs and Params without significant Acc. Drop.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the personality of Russians who support the war in Ukraine is
one of the key steps to understanding how this war became possible. However,
during the war, traditional sociological methods are not always applicable.
Social media provides an alternative source of what is inside people's heads.
In this paper, I compare the political identities, values, and interests of
social media users in Russia who hold a strong position for or against the war
in Ukraine. I collect data from VK, the most popular Russian social media
platform, and analyze self-filled profile information as well as the groups
that the users subscribed to. I found that proponents of the war tend to have a
weaker political identity (self-identified as "moderate") compared to
opponents, who specify it more precisely (often, but not limited to,
"liberal"). Additionally, the values of the proponents more frequently align
with those promoted by the Russian government, such as orthodoxy and family.
Despite these differences, pro-war and anti-war users share many common
interests, as evidenced by their subscriptions to the same groups focused on
music, history, and sport. When asked to state the most important trait in
people (a field users can fill in VK), the most frequent answer for both groups
is "kindness and honesty". The analysis results, in addition to contributing to
the understanding of public opinion in Russia, can be utilized for predicting
one's position on the war based on their social media profile.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned to follow human instruction
have exhibited significant capabilities in various English NLP tasks. However,
their performance in grammatical error correction (GEC) tasks, particularly in
non-English languages, remains significantly unexplored. In this paper, we
delve into abilities of instruction fine-tuned LLMs in Arabic GEC, a task made
complex due to Arabic's rich morphology. Our findings suggest that various
prompting methods, coupled with (in-context) few-shot learning, demonstrate
considerable effectiveness, with GPT-4 achieving up to $65.49$
F\textsubscript{1} score under expert prompting (approximately $5$ points
higher than our established baseline). This highlights the potential of LLMs in
low-resource settings, offering a viable approach for generating useful
synthetic data for model training. Despite these positive results, we find that
instruction fine-tuned models, regardless of their size, significantly
underperform compared to fully fine-tuned models of significantly smaller
sizes. This disparity highlights a substantial room for improvements for LLMs.
Inspired by methods from low-resource machine translation, we also develop a
method exploiting synthetic data that significantly outperforms previous models
on two standard Arabic benchmarks. Our work sets new SoTA for Arabic GEC, with
$72.19\%$ and $73.26$ F$_{1}$ on the 2014 and 2015 QALB datasets, respectively.

(PINNs) approach for the first time to predict the flow field of a compressor
cascade. The approach is demonstrated on a two-dimensional problem,
incorporating Navier-Stokes equations in both the forward and inverse problems.
In the forward problem, PINNs effectively predict the flow field of the
compressor. The key advantage over Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is that the
PINNs model incorporates a physical relationship between the relevant
quantities, resulting in more precise predictions. PINNs show obvious
advantages over the traditional CFD approaches when dealing with inverse
problems in the absence of partial boundary conditions. PINNs successfully
reconstruct the flow field of the compressor cascade solely based on partial
velocity vectors and wall pressure information. This research provides
compelling evidence that PINNs offer turbomachinery designers a promising
alternative to the current dominant CFD methods, delivering higher accuracy
compared to DNNs.

<p class="mathjax">It has been a hot research topic to enable machines to understand human
emotions in multimodal contexts under dialogue scenarios, which is tasked with
multimodal emotion analysis in conversation (MM-ERC). MM-ERC has received
consistent attention in recent years, where a diverse range of methods has been
proposed for securing better task performance. Most existing works treat MM-ERC
as a standard multimodal classification problem and perform multimodal feature
disentanglement and fusion for maximizing feature utility. Yet after revisiting
the characteristic of MM-ERC, we argue that both the feature multimodality and
conversational contextualization should be properly modeled simultaneously
during the feature disentanglement and fusion steps. In this work, we target
further pushing the task performance by taking full consideration of the above
insights. On the one hand, during feature disentanglement, based on the
contrastive learning technique, we devise a Dual-level Disentanglement
Mechanism (DDM) to decouple the features into both the modality space and
utterance space. On the other hand, during the feature fusion stage, we propose
a Contribution-aware Fusion Mechanism (CFM) and a Context Refusion Mechanism
(CRM) for multimodal and context integration, respectively. They together
schedule the proper integrations of multimodal and context features.
Specifically, CFM explicitly manages the multimodal feature contributions
dynamically, while CRM flexibly coordinates the introduction of dialogue
contexts. On two public MM-ERC datasets, our system achieves new
state-of-the-art performance consistently. Further analyses demonstrate that
all our proposed mechanisms greatly facilitate the MM-ERC task by making full
use of the multimodal and context features adaptively. Note that our proposed
methods have the great potential to facilitate a broader range of other
conversational multimodal tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Dashboards are no longer mere static displays of metrics; through
functionality such as interaction and storytelling, they have evolved to
support analytic and communicative goals like monitoring and reporting.
Existing dashboard design guidelines, however, are often unable to account for
this expanded scope as they largely focus on best practices for visual design.
In contrast, we frame dashboard design as facilitating an analytical
conversation: a cooperative, interactive experience where a user may interact
with, reason about, or freely query the underlying data. By drawing on
established principles of conversational flow and communication, we define the
concept of a cooperative dashboard as one that enables a fruitful and
productive analytical conversation, and derive a set of 39 dashboard design
heuristics to support effective analytical conversations. To assess the utility
of this framing, we asked 52 computer science and engineering graduate students
to apply our heuristics to critique and design dashboards as part of an
ungraded, opt-in homework assignment. Feedback from participants demonstrates
that our heuristics surface new reasons dashboards may fail, and encourage a
more fluid, supportive, and responsive style of dashboard design. Our approach
suggests several compelling directions for future work, including dashboard
authoring tools that better anticipate conversational turn-taking, repair, and
refinement and extending cooperative principles to other analytical workflows.

can be applied out of the box without any training). We adopt a training
framework for optimizing detector models using automatic labeling procedures.
This framework encompasses different training sets/modes and multi-round
automatic labeling strategies. We conduct our analyses on the
publicly-available WILDTRACK and MultiviewX datasets. We show that, by using
the automatic labeling approach based on an untrained detector, we can obtain
superior results than directly using the untrained detector or a detector
trained with an existing labeled source dataset. It achieved a MODA about 4%
and 1% better than the best existing unlabeled method when using WILDTRACK and
MultiviewX as target datasets, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Machines that mimic humans have inspired scientists for centuries.
Bio-inspired soft robotic hands are a good example of such an endeavor,
featuring intrinsic material compliance and continuous motion to deal with
uncertainty and adapt to unstructured environments. Recent research led to
impactful achievements in functional designs, modeling, fabrication, and
control of soft robots. Nevertheless, the full realization of life-like
movements is still challenging to achieve, often based on trial-and-error
considerations from design to fabrication, consuming time and resources. In
this study, a soft robotic hand is proposed, composed of soft actuator cores
and an exoskeleton, featuring a multi-material design aided by finite element
analysis (FEA) to define the hand geometry and promote finger's bendability.
The actuators are fabricated using molding and the exoskeleton is 3D-printed in
a single step. An ON-OFF controller keeps the set fingers' inner pressures
related to specific bending angles, even in the presence of leaks. The FEA
numerical results were validated by experimental tests, as well as the ability
of the hand to grasp objects with different shapes, weights and sizes. This
integrated solution will make soft robotic hands more available to people, at a
reduced cost, avoiding the time-consuming design-fabrication trial-and-error
processes.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional approaches in speech emotion recognition, such as LSTM, CNN, RNN,
SVM, and MLP, have limitations such as difficulty capturing long-term
dependencies in sequential data, capturing the temporal dynamics, and
struggling to capture complex patterns and relationships in multimodal data.
This research addresses these shortcomings by proposing an ensemble model that
combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for processing textual data and the
HuBERT transformer for analyzing audio signals. We found that GCNs excel at
capturing Long-term contextual dependencies and relationships within textual
data by leveraging graph-based representations of text and thus detecting the
contextual meaning and semantic relationships between words. On the other hand,
HuBERT utilizes self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies,
enabling the modeling of temporal dynamics present in speech and capturing
subtle nuances and variations that contribute to emotion recognition. By
combining GCN and HuBERT, our ensemble model can leverage the strengths of both
approaches. This allows for the simultaneous analysis of multimodal data, and
the fusion of these modalities enables the extraction of complementary
information, enhancing the discriminative power of the emotion recognition
system. The results indicate that the combined model can overcome the
limitations of traditional methods, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing
emotions from speech.

<p class="mathjax">The multimodal Lambek calculus is an extension of the Lambek calculus that
includes several product operations (some of them being commutative or/and
associative), unary modalities, and corresponding residual implications. In
this work, we relate this calculus to the hypergraph Lambek calculus HL. The
latter is a general pure logic of residuation defined in a sequent form;
antecedents of its sequents are hypergraphs, and the rules of HL involve
hypergraph transformation. Our main result is the embedding of the multimodal
Lambek calculus (with at most one associative product) in HL. It justifies that
HL is a very general Lambek-style logic and also provides a novel syntactic
interface for the multimodal Lambek calculus: antecedents of sequents of the
multimodal Lambek calculus are represented as tree-like hypergraphs in HL, and
they are derived from each other by means of hyperedge replacement. The
advantage of this embedding is that commutativity and associativity are
incorporated in the sequent structure rather than added as separate rules.
Besides, modalities of the multimodal Lambek calculus are represented in HL
using the product and the division of HL, which explicitizes their residual
nature.

<p class="mathjax">Steganography and steganalysis are two interrelated aspects of the field of
information security. Steganography seeks to conceal communications, whereas
steganalysis is aimed to either find them or even, if possible, recover the
data they contain. Steganography and steganalysis have attracted a great deal
of interest, particularly from law enforcement. Steganography is often used by
cybercriminals and even terrorists to avoid being captured while in possession
of incriminating evidence, even encrypted, since cryptography is prohibited or
restricted in many countries. Therefore, knowledge of cutting-edge techniques
to uncover concealed information is crucial in exposing illegal acts. Over the
last few years, a number of strong and reliable steganography and steganalysis
techniques have been introduced in the literature. This review paper provides a
comprehensive overview of deep learning-based steganalysis techniques used to
detect hidden information within digital media. The paper covers all types of
cover in steganalysis, including image, audio, and video, and discusses the
most commonly used deep learning techniques. In addition, the paper explores
the use of more advanced deep learning techniques, such as deep transfer
learning (DTL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to enhance the
performance of steganalysis systems. The paper provides a systematic review of
recent research in the field, including data sets and evaluation metrics used
in recent studies. It also presents a detailed analysis of DTL-based
steganalysis approaches and their performance on different data sets. The
review concludes with a discussion on the current state of deep learning-based
steganalysis, challenges, and future research directions.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we describe a method for large-scale 3D cell-tracking through a
segmentation selection approach. The proposed method is effective at tracking
cells across large microscopy datasets on two fronts: (i) It can solve problems
containing millions of segmentation instances in terabyte-scale 3D+t datasets;
(ii) It achieves competitive results with or without deep learning, which
requires 3D annotated data, that is scarce in the fluorescence microscopy
field. The proposed method computes cell tracks and segments using a hierarchy
of segmentation hypotheses and selects disjoint segments by maximizing the
overlap between adjacent frames. We show that this method achieves
state-of-the-art results in 3D images from the cell tracking challenge and has
a faster integer linear programming formulation. Moreover, our framework is
flexible and supports segmentations from off-the-shelf cell segmentation models
and can combine them into an ensemble that improves tracking. The code is

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning for unsupervised image segmentation remains challenging due to
the absence of human labels. The common idea is to train a segmentation head,
with the supervision of pixel-wise pseudo-labels generated based on the
representation of self-supervised backbones. By doing so, the model performance
depends much on the distance between the distributions of target datasets and
the pre-training dataset (e.g., ImageNet). In this work, we investigate a new
task, namely unsupervised camouflaged object segmentation (UCOS), where the
target objects own a common rarely-seen attribute, i.e., camouflage.
Unsurprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art unsupervised models struggle
in adapting UCOS, due to the domain gap between the properties of generic and
camouflaged objects. To this end, we formulate the UCOS as a source-free
unsupervised domain adaptation task (UCOS-DA), where both source labels and
target labels are absent during the whole model training process. Specifically,
we define a source model consisting of self-supervised vision transformers
pre-trained on ImageNet. On the other hand, the target domain includes a simple
linear layer (i.e., our target model) and unlabeled camouflaged objects. We
then design a pipeline for foreground-background-contrastive self-adversarial
domain adaptation, to achieve robust UCOS. As a result, our baseline model
achieves superior segmentation performance when compared with competing
unsupervised models on the UCOS benchmark, with the training set which's scale
is only one tenth of the supervised COS counterpart.

<p class="mathjax">Today, the great performance of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) has been proven in
various fields. One of its most attractive applications is to produce artistic
designs. A carpet that is known as a piece of art is one of the most important
items in a house, which has many enthusiasts all over the world. The first
stage of producing a carpet is to prepare its map, which is a difficult,
time-consuming, and expensive task. In this research work, our purpose is to
use DNN for generating a Modern Persian Carpet Map. To reach this aim, three
different DNN style transfer methods are proposed and compared against each
other. In the proposed methods, the Style-Swap method is utilized to create the
initial carpet map, and in the following, to generate more diverse designs,
methods Clip-Styler, Gatys, and Style-Swap are used separately. In addition,
some methods are examined and introduced for coloring the produced carpet maps.
The designed maps are evaluated via the results of filled questionnaires where
the outcomes of user evaluations confirm the popularity of generated carpet
maps. Eventually, for the first time, intelligent methods are used in producing
carpet maps, and it reduces human intervention. The proposed methods can
successfully produce diverse carpet designs, and at a higher speed than
traditional ways.

<p class="mathjax">Drones are being used to assess the situation in various disasters. In this
study, we investigate a method to automatically estimate the damage status of
people based on their actions in aerial drone images in order to understand
disaster sites faster and save labor. We constructed a new dataset of aerial
images of human actions in a hypothetical disaster that occurred in an urban
area, and classified the human damage status using 3D ResNet. The results
showed that the status with characteristic human actions could be classified
with a recall rate of more than 80%, while other statuses with similar human
actions could only be classified with a recall rate of about 50%. In addition,
a cloud-based VR presentation application suggested the effectiveness of using
drones to understand the disaster site and estimate the human condition.

<p class="mathjax">Spotting facial micro-expression from videos finds various potential
applications in fields including clinical diagnosis and interrogation,
meanwhile this task is still difficult due to the limited scale of training
data. To solve this problem, this paper tries to formulate a new task called
micro-expression generation and then presents a strong baseline which combines
the first order motion model with facial prior knowledge. Given a target face,
we intend to drive the face to generate micro-expression videos according to
the motion patterns of source videos. Specifically, our new model involves
three modules. First, we extract facial prior features from a region focusing
module. Second, we estimate facial motion using key points and local affine
transformations with a motion prediction module. Third, expression generation
module is used to drive the target face to generate videos. We train our model
on public CASME II, SAMM and SMIC datasets and then use the model to generate
new micro-expression videos for evaluation. Our model achieves the first place
in the Facial Micro-Expression Challenge 2021 (MEGC2021), where our superior
performance is verified by three experts with Facial Action Coding System
certification. Source code is provided in

<p class="mathjax">The hypergraph community detection problem seeks to identify groups of
related nodes in hypergraph data. We propose an information-theoretic
hypergraph community detection algorithm which compresses the observed data in
terms of community labels and community-edge intersections. This algorithm can
also be viewed as maximum-likelihood inference in a degree-corrected
microcanonical stochastic blockmodel. We perform the inference/compression step
via simulated annealing. Unlike several recent algorithms based on canonical
models, our microcanonical algorithm does not require inference of statistical
parameters such as node degrees or pairwise group connection rates. Through
synthetic experiments, we find that our algorithm succeeds down to
recently-conjectured thresholds for sparse random hypergraphs. We also find
competitive performance in cluster recovery tasks on several hypergraph data
sets.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to learn continuously from an incoming data stream without
catastrophic forgetting is critical to designing intelligent systems. Many
approaches to continual learning rely on stochastic gradient descent and its
variants that employ global error updates, and hence need to adopt strategies
such as memory buffers or replay to circumvent its stability, greed, and
short-term memory limitations. To address this limitation, we have developed a
biologically inspired lightweight neural network architecture that incorporates
synaptic plasticity mechanisms and neuromodulation and hence learns through
local error signals to enable online continual learning without stochastic
gradient descent.
<br />Our approach leads to superior online continual learning performance on
Split-MNIST, Split-CIFAR-10, and Split-CIFAR-100 datasets compared to other
memory-constrained learning approaches and matches that of the state-of-the-art
memory-intensive replay-based approaches. We further demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by integrating key design concepts into other
backpropagation-based continual learning algorithms, significantly improving
their accuracy. Our results provide compelling evidence for the importance of
incorporating biological principles into machine learning models and offer
insights into how we can leverage them to design more efficient and robust
systems for online continual learning.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an efficient way of detecting directed objects by
predicting their center coordinates and direction angle. Since the objects are
of uniform size, the proposed model works without predicting the object's width
and height. The dataset used for this problem is presented in Honeybee
Segmentation and Tracking Datasets project. One of the contributions of this
work is an examination of the ability of the standard real-time object
detection architecture like YoloV7 to be customized for position and direction
detection. A very efficient, tiny version of the architecture is used in this
approach. Moreover, only one of three detection heads without anchors is
sufficient for this task. We also introduce the extended Skew Intersection over
Union (SkewIoU) calculation for rotated boxes - directed IoU (DirIoU), which
includes an absolute angle difference. DirIoU is used both in the matching
procedure of target and predicted bounding boxes for mAP calculation, and in
the NMS filtering procedure. The code and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">We study a two-player game on a graph between an attacker and a defender. To
begin with, the defender places guards on a subset of vertices. In each move,
the attacker attacks an edge. The defender must move at least one guard across
the attacked edge to defend the attack. The defender wins if and only if the
defender can defend an infinite sequence of attacks. The smallest number of
guards with which the defender has a winning strategy is called the eternal
vertex cover number of a graph $G$ and is denoted by $evc(G)$. It is clear that
$evc(G)$ is at least $mvc(G)$, the size of a minimum vertex cover of $G$. We
say that $G$ is Spartan if $evc(G) = mvc(G)$. The characterization of Spartan
graphs has been largely open. In the setting of bipartite graphs on $2n$
vertices where every edge belongs to a perfect matching, an easy strategy is to
have $n$ guards that always move along perfect matchings in response to
attacks. We show that these are essentially the only Spartan bipartite graphs.

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have become the primary backbone of the computer vision
community due to their impressive performance. However, the unfriendly
computation cost impedes their potential in the video recognition domain. To
optimize the speed-accuracy trade-off, we propose Semantic-aware Temporal
Accumulation score (STA) to prune spatio-temporal tokens integrally. STA score
considers two critical factors: temporal redundancy and semantic importance.
The former depicts a specific region based on whether it is a new occurrence or
a seen entity by aggregating token-to-token similarity in consecutive frames
while the latter evaluates each token based on its contribution to the overall
prediction. As a result, tokens with higher scores of STA carry more temporal
redundancy as well as lower semantics thus being pruned. Based on the STA
score, we are able to progressively prune the tokens without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further re-training. We directly apply the
STA module to off-the-shelf ViT and VideoSwin backbones, and the empirical
results on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2 achieve over 30% computation
reduction with a negligible ~0.2% accuracy drop. The code is released at
https://github.com/Mark12Ding/STA.

<p class="mathjax">Whales are an important part of the oceanic ecosystem. Although historic
commercial whale hunting a.k.a. whaling has severely threatened whale
populations, whale researchers are looking at historical whaling data to inform
current whale status and future conservation efforts. To facilitate this, we
worked with experts in aquatic and fishery sciences to create WhaleVis -- an
interactive dashboard for the commercial whaling dataset maintained by the
International Whaling Commission (IWC). We characterize key analysis tasks
among whale researchers for this database, most important of which is inferring
spatial distribution of whale populations over time. In addition to
facilitating analysis of whale catches based on the spatio-temporal attributes,
we use whaling expedition details to plot the search routes of expeditions. We
propose a model of the catch data as a graph, where nodes represent catch
locations, and edges represent whaling expedition routes. This model
facilitates visual estimation of whale search effort and in turn the spatial
distribution of whale populations normalized by the search effort -- a well
known problem in fisheries research. It further opens up new avenues for graph
analysis on the data, including more rigorous computation of spatial
distribution of whales normalized by the search effort, and enabling new
insight generation. We demonstrate the use of our dashboard through a real life
use case.

<p class="mathjax">Visual recognition models are prone to learning spurious correlations induced
by an imbalanced training set where certain groups (\eg Females) are
under-represented in certain classes (\eg Programmers). Generative models offer
a promising direction in mitigating this bias by generating synthetic data for
the minority samples and thus balancing the training set. However, prior work
that uses these approaches overlooks that visual recognition models could often
learn to differentiate between real and synthetic images and thus fail to
unlearn the bias in the original dataset. In our work, we propose a novel
two-stage pipeline to mitigate this issue where 1) we pre-train a model on a
balanced synthetic dataset and then 2) fine-tune on the real data. Using this
pipeline, we avoid training on both real and synthetic data, thus avoiding the
bias between real and synthetic data. Moreover, we learn robust features
against the bias in the first step that mitigate the bias in the second step.
Moreover, our pipeline naturally integrates with bias mitigation methods; they
can be simply applied to the fine-tuning step. As our experiments prove, our
pipeline can further improve the performance of bias mitigation methods
obtaining state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets.

<p class="mathjax">False negatives (FN) in 3D object detection, {\em e.g.}, missing predictions
of pedestrians, vehicles, or other obstacles, can lead to potentially dangerous
situations in autonomous driving. While being fatal, this issue is understudied
in many current 3D detection methods. In this work, we propose Hard Instance
Probing (HIP), a general pipeline that identifies \textit{FN} in a multi-stage
manner and guides the models to focus on excavating difficult instances. For 3D
object detection, we instantiate this method as FocalFormer3D, a simple yet
effective detector that excels at excavating difficult objects and improving
prediction recall. FocalFormer3D features a multi-stage query generation to
discover hard objects and a box-level transformer decoder to efficiently
distinguish objects from massive object candidates. Experimental results on the
nuScenes and Waymo datasets validate the superior performance of FocalFormer3D.
The advantage leads to strong performance on both detection and tracking, in
both LiDAR and multi-modal settings. Notably, FocalFormer3D achieves a 70.5 mAP
and 73.9 NDS on nuScenes detection benchmark, while the nuScenes tracking
benchmark shows 72.1 AMOTA, both ranking 1st place on the nuScenes LiDAR
leaderboard. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Internet of Things (IoT) systems require highly scalable infrastructure to
adaptively provide services to meet various performance requirements. Combining
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) technology
brings more flexibility for IoT systems. We present a four-tier task processing
architecture for MEC and vehicular networks, which includes processing tasks
locally within a vehicle, on neighboring vehicles, on an edge cloud, and on a
remote cloud. The flexible network connection is controlled by SDN. We propose
a CPU resource allocation algorithm, called Partial Idle Resource Strategy
(PIRS) with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communications, based on Asymmetric Nash
Bargaining Solution (ANBS) in Game Theory. PIRS encourages vehicles in the same
location to cooperate by sharing part of their spare CPU resources. In our
simulations, we adopt four applications running on the vehicles to generate
workload. We compare the proposed algorithm with Non-Cooperation Strategy (NCS)
and All Idle Resource Strategy (AIRS). In NCS, the vehicles execute tasks
generated by the applications in their own On-Board Units (OBU), while in AIRS
vehicles provide all their CPU resources to help other vehicles offloading
requests. Our simulation results show that our PIRS strategy can execute more
tasks on the V2V layer and lead to fewer number of task (and their length) to
be offloaded to the cloud, reaching up to 28% improvement compared to NCS and
up to 10% improvement compared to AIRS.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models tend to take advantage of spurious
correlations (also known as dataset bias or annotation artifacts in the
research community). Consequently, these models may perform the MRC task
without fully comprehending the given context and question, which is
undesirable since it may result in low robustness against distribution shift.
This paper delves into the concept of answer-position bias, where a significant
percentage of training questions have answers located solely in the first
sentence of the context. We propose a Single-Sentence Reader as a new approach
for addressing answer position bias in MRC. We implement this approach using
six different models and thoroughly analyze their performance. Remarkably, our
proposed Single-Sentence Readers achieve results that nearly match those of
models trained on conventional training sets, proving their effectiveness. Our
study also discusses several challenges our Single-Sentence Readers encounter
and proposes a potential solution.

<p class="mathjax">Typical black-box optimization approaches in robotics focus on learning from
metric scores. However, that is not always possible, as not all developers have
ground truth available. Learning appropriate robot behavior in human-centric
contexts often requires querying users, who typically cannot provide precise
metric scores. Existing approaches leverage human feedback in an attempt to
model an implicit reward function; however, this reward may be difficult or
impossible to effectively capture. In this work, we introduce SortCMA to
optimize algorithm parameter configurations in high dimensions based on
pairwise user preferences. SortCMA efficiently and robustly leverages user
input to find parameter sets without directly modeling a reward. We apply this
method to tuning a commercial depth sensor without ground truth, and to robot
social navigation, which involves highly complex preferences over robot
behavior. We show that our method succeeds in optimizing for the user's goals
and perform a user study to evaluate social navigation results.

<p class="mathjax">We study a generalization of the classic Spanning Tree problem that allows
for a non-uniform failure model. More precisely, edges are either \emph{safe}
or \emph{unsafe} and we assume that failures only affect unsafe edges. In
Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity we are given an undirected graph $G =
(V,E)$ in which the edge set $E$ is partitioned into a set $S$ of safe edges
and a set $U$ of unsafe edges and the task is to find a set $T$ of at most $k$
edges such that $T - \{u\}$ is connected and spans $V$ for any unsafe edge $u
\in T$. Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity generalizes both Spanning Tree
and Hamiltonian Cycle. We study Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity in terms
of fixed-parameter tractability (FPT). We show an almost complete dichotomy on
which parameters lead to fixed-parameter tractability and which lead to
hardness. To this end, we obtain FPT-time algorithms with respect to the vertex
deletion distance to cluster graphs and with respect to the treewidth. By
exploiting the close relationship to Hamiltonian Cycle, we show that FPT-time
algorithms for many smaller parameters are unlikely under standard
parameterized complexity assumptions. Regarding problem-specific parameters, we
observe that Unweighted Flexible Graph Connectivity} admits an FPT-time
algorithm when parameterized by the number of unsafe edges. Furthermore, we
investigate a below-upper-bound parameter for the number of edges of a
solution. We show that this parameter also leads to an FPT-time algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past two decades, recommendation systems (RSs) have used machine
learning (ML) solutions to recommend items, e.g., movies, books, and
restaurants, to clients of a business or an online platform. Recipe
recommendation, however, has not yet received much attention compared to those
applications. We introduce RECipe as a multi-purpose recipe recommendation
framework with a multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) backbone. The motivation
behind RECipe is to go beyond (deep) neural collaborative filtering (NCF) by
recommending recipes to users when they query in natural language or by
providing an image. RECipe consists of 3 subsystems: (1) behavior-based
recommender, (2) review-based recommender, and (3) image-based recommender.
Each subsystem relies on the embedding representations of entities and
relations in the graph. We first obtain (pre-trained) embedding representations
of textual entities, such as reviews or ingredients, from a fine-tuned model of
Microsoft's MPNet. We initialize the weights of the entities with these
embeddings to train our knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model. For the visual
component, i.e., recipe images, we develop a KGE-Guided variational autoencoder
(KG-VAE) to learn the distribution of images and their latent representations.
Once KGE and KG-VAE models are fully trained, we use them as a multi-purpose
recommendation framework. For benchmarking, we created two knowledge graphs
(KGs) from public datasets on Kaggle for recipe recommendation. Our experiments
show that the KGE models have comparable performance to the neural solutions.
We also present pre-trained NLP embeddings to address important applications
such as zero-shot inference for new users (or the cold start problem) and
conditional recommendation with respect to recipe categories. We eventually
demonstrate the application of RECipe in a multi-purpose recommendation
setting.

<p class="mathjax">3D lane detection from monocular images is a fundamental yet challenging task
in autonomous driving. Recent advances primarily rely on structural 3D
surrogates (e.g., bird's eye view) that are built from front-view image
features and camera parameters. However, the depth ambiguity in monocular
images inevitably causes misalignment between the constructed surrogate feature
map and the original image, posing a great challenge for accurate lane
detection. To address the above issue, we present a novel LATR model, an
end-to-end 3D lane detector that uses 3D-aware front-view features without
transformed view representation. Specifically, LATR detects 3D lanes via
cross-attention based on query and key-value pairs, constructed using our
lane-aware query generator and dynamic 3D ground positional embedding. On the
one hand, each query is generated based on 2D lane-aware features and adopts a
hybrid embedding to enhance the lane information. On the other hand, 3D space
information is injected as positional embedding from an iteratively-updated 3D
ground plane. LATR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both
synthetic Apollo and realistic OpenLane by large margins (e.g., 11.4 gains in
terms of F1 score on OpenLane). Code will be released at
https://github.com/JMoonr/LATR.

<p class="mathjax">Although some current AIs surpass human abilities especially in closed worlds
such as board games, their performance in the messy real world is limited. They
make strange mistakes and do not notice them. They cannot be instructed easily,
fail to use common sense, and lack curiosity. They do not make good
collaborators. Neither systems built using the traditional manually-constructed
symbolic AI approach nor systems built using generative and deep learning AI
approaches including large language models (LLMs) can meet the challenges. They
are not well suited for creating robust and trustworthy AIs. Although it is
outside of mainstream AI approaches, developmental bootstrapping shows promise.
In developmental bootstrapping, AIs develop competences like human children do.
They start with innate competences. Like humans, they interact with the
environment and learn from their interactions. They incrementally extend their
innate competences with self-developed competences. They interact and learn
from people and establish perceptual, cognitive, and common grounding.
Following a bootstrapping process, they acquire the competences that they need.
However, developmental robotics has not yet produced AIs with robust
adult-level competences. Projects have typically stopped at the Toddler Barrier
corresponding to human infant development at about two years of age, before
speech is fluent. They also do not bridge the Reading Barrier, where they can
skillfully and skeptically tap into the vast socially developed recorded
information resources that power LLMs. The next competences in human cognitive
development involve intrinsic motivation, imitation learning, imagination,
coordination, and communication. This paper lays out the logic, prospects,
gaps, and challenges for extending the practice of developmental bootstrapping
to create robust and resilient AIs.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, uncertainty-aware deep learning methods for multiclass labeling
problems have been developed that provide calibrated class prediction
probabilities and out-of-distribution (OOD) indicators, letting machine
learning (ML) consumers and engineers gauge a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, this extra neural network prediction information is
challenging to scalably convey visually for arbitrary data sources under
multiple uncertainty contexts. To address these challenges, we present
ScatterUQ, an interactive system that provides targeted visualizations to allow
users to better understand model performance in context-driven uncertainty
settings. ScatterUQ leverages recent advances in distance-aware neural
networks, together with dimensionality reduction techniques, to construct
robust, 2-D scatter plots explaining why a model predicts a test example to be
(1) in-distribution and of a particular class, (2) in-distribution but unsure
of the class, and (3) out-of-distribution. ML consumers and engineers can
visually compare the salient features of test samples with training examples
through the use of a ``hover callback'' to understand model uncertainty
performance and decide follow up courses of action. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScatterUQ to explain model uncertainty for a multiclass image
classification on a distance-aware neural network trained on Fashion-MNIST and
tested on Fashion-MNIST (in distribution) and MNIST digits (out of
distribution), as well as a deep learning model for a cyber dataset. We
quantitatively evaluate dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize our
contextually driven UQ visualizations. Our results indicate that the ScatterUQ
system should scale to arbitrary, multiclass datasets. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">The emerging field of action prediction plays a vital role in various
computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, activity analysis and
human-computer interaction. Despite significant advancements, accurately
predicting future actions remains a challenging problem due to high
dimensionality, complex dynamics and uncertainties inherent in video data.
Traditional supervised approaches require large amounts of labelled data, which
is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This paper introduces a novel
self-supervised video strategy for enhancing action prediction inspired by DINO
(self-distillation with no labels). The Temporal-DINO approach employs two
models; a 'student' processing past frames; and a 'teacher' processing both
past and future frames, enabling a broader temporal context. During training,
the teacher guides the student to learn future context by only observing past
frames. The strategy is evaluated on ROAD dataset for the action prediction
downstream task using 3D-ResNet, Transformer, and LSTM architectures. The
experimental results showcase significant improvements in prediction
performance across these architectures, with our method achieving an average
enhancement of 9.9% Precision Points (PP), highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing the backbones' capabilities of capturing long-term dependencies.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates efficiency regarding the pretraining
dataset size and the number of epochs required. This method overcomes
limitations present in other approaches, including considering various backbone
architectures, addressing multiple prediction horizons, reducing reliance on
hand-crafted augmentations, and streamlining the pretraining process into a
single stage. These findings highlight the potential of our approach in diverse
video-based tasks such as activity recognition, motion planning, and scene
understanding.

<p class="mathjax">Tensor decomposition of convolutional and fully-connected layers is an
effective way to reduce parameters and FLOP in neural networks. Due to memory
and power consumption limitations of mobile or embedded devices, the
quantization step is usually necessary when pre-trained models are deployed. A
conventional post-training quantization approach applied to networks with
decomposed weights yields a drop in accuracy. This motivated us to develop an
algorithm that finds tensor approximation directly with quantized factors and
thus benefit from both compression techniques while keeping the prediction
quality of the model. Namely, we propose to use Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) for Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition with factors whose
elements lie on a specified quantization grid. We compress neural network
weights with a devised algorithm and evaluate it's prediction quality and
performance. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art post-training

<p class="mathjax">Currently, Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) aims at segmenting and
categorizing objects in videos from a closed set of training categories that
contain only a few dozen of categories, lacking the ability to handle diverse
objects in real-world videos. As TAO and BURST datasets release, we have the
opportunity to research VIS in long-tailed and open-world scenarios.
Traditional VIS methods are evaluated on benchmarks limited to a small number
of common classes, But practical applications require trackers that go beyond
these common classes, detecting and tracking rare and even never-before-seen
objects. Inspired by the latest MOT paper for the long tail task (Tracking
Every Thing in the Wild, Siyuan Li et), for the BURST long tail challenge, we
train our model on a combination of LVISv0.5 and the COCO dataset using repeat
factor sampling. First, train the detector with segmentation and CEM on
LVISv0.5 + COCO dataset. And then, train the instance appearance similarity
head on the TAO dataset. at last, our method (LeTracker) gets 14.9 HOTAall in
the BURST test set, ranking 1st in the benchmark. for the open-world
challenges, we only use 64 classes (Intersection classes of BURST Train subset
and COCO dataset, without LVIS dataset) annotations data training, and testing
on BURST test set data and get 61.4 OWTAall, ranking 1st in the benchmark. Our
code will be released to facilitate future research.

<p class="mathjax">We show that for every homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$, if it has
determinantal complexity at most $s$, then it can be computed by a homogeneous
algebraic branching program (ABP) of size at most $O(d^5s)$. Moreover, we show
that for $\textit{most}$ homogeneous polynomials, the width of the resulting
homogeneous ABP is just $s-1$ and the size is at most $O(ds)$.
<br />Thus, for constant degree homogeneous polynomials, their determinantal
complexity and ABP complexity are within a constant factor of each other and
hence, a super-linear lower bound for ABPs for any constant degree polynomial
implies a super-linear lower bound on determinantal complexity; this relates
two open problems of great interest in algebraic complexity. As of now,
super-linear lower bounds for ABPs are known only for polynomials of growing
degree, and for determinantal complexity the best lower bounds are larger than
the number of variables only by a constant factor.
<br />While determinantal complexity and ABP complexity are classically known to be
polynomially equivalent, the standard transformation from the former to the
latter incurs a polynomial blow up in size in the process, and thus, it was
unclear if a super-linear lower bound for ABPs implies a super-linear lower
bound on determinantal complexity. In particular, a size preserving
transformation from determinantal complexity to ABPs does not appear to have
been known prior to this work, even for constant degree polynomials.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a new cognitive model, acting as the main component of an
AGI agent. The model is introduced in its mature intelligence state, and as an
extension of previous models, DENN, and especially AKREM, by including
operational models (frames/classes) and will. This model's core assumption is
that cognition is about operating on accumulated knowledge, with the guidance
of an appropriate will. Also, we assume that the actions, part of knowledge,
are learning to be aligned with will, during the evolution phase that precedes
the mature intelligence state. In addition, this model is mainly based on the
duality principle in every known intelligent aspect, such as exhibiting both
top-down and bottom-up model learning, generalization verse specialization, and
more. Furthermore, a holistic approach is advocated for AGI designing, and
cognition under constraints or efficiency is proposed, in the form of
reusability and simplicity. Finally, reaching this mature state is described
via a cognitive evolution from infancy to adulthood, utilizing a consolidation
principle. The final product of this cognitive model is a dynamic operational
memory of models and instances. Lastly, some examples and preliminary ideas for
the evolution phase to reach the mature state are presented.

<p class="mathjax">The NSF-funded Robust Epidemic Surveillance and Modeling (RESUME) project
successfully convened a workshop entitled "High-performance computing and
large-scale data management in service of epidemiological modeling" at the
University of Chicago on May 1-2, 2023. This was part of a series of workshops
designed to foster sustainable and interdisciplinary co-design for predictive
intelligence and pandemic prevention. The event brought together 31 experts in
epidemiological modeling, high-performance computing (HPC), HPC workflows, and
large-scale data management to develop a shared vision for capabilities needed
for computational epidemiology to better support pandemic prevention. Through
the workshop, participants identified key areas in which HPC capabilities could
be used to improve epidemiological modeling, particularly in supporting public
health decision-making, with an emphasis on HPC workflows, data integration,
and HPC access. The workshop explored nascent HPC workflow and large-scale data
management approaches currently in use for epidemiological modeling and sought
to draw from approaches used in other domains to determine which practices
could be best adapted for use in epidemiological modeling. This report
documents the key findings and takeaways from the workshop.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, federated learning (FL) has become a very popular paradigm
for training distributed, large-scale, and privacy-preserving machine learning
(ML) systems. In contrast to standard ML, where data must be collected at the
exact location where training is performed, FL takes advantage of the
computational capabilities of millions of edge devices to collaboratively train
a shared, global model without disclosing their local private data.
Specifically, in a typical FL system, the central server acts only as an
orchestrator; it iteratively gathers and aggregates all the local models
trained by each client on its private data until convergence. Although FL
undoubtedly has several benefits over traditional ML (e.g., it protects private
data ownership by design), it suffers from several weaknesses. One of the most
critical challenges is to overcome the centralized orchestration of the
classical FL client-server architecture, which is known to be vulnerable to
single-point-of-failure risks and man-in-the-middle attacks, among others. To
mitigate such exposure, decentralized FL solutions have emerged where all FL
clients cooperate and communicate without a central server. This survey
comprehensively summarizes and reviews existing decentralized FL approaches
proposed in the literature. Furthermore, it identifies emerging challenges and
suggests promising research directions in this under-explored domain.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of connectivity assessment in an asymmetric network represented
by a weighted directed graph is investigated in this article. A power iteration
algorithm in a centralized implementation is developed first to compute the
generalized algebraic connectivity of asymmetric networks. After properly
transforming the Laplacian matrix of the network, two sequences of
one-dimensional and two-dimensional subspaces are generated iteratively, one of
which converges to the desired subspace spanned by the eigenvector(s)
associated with the eigenvalue(s) representing the network's generalized
algebraic connectivity. A distributed implementation of the proposed power
iteration algorithm is then developed to compute the generalized algebraic
connectivity from the viewpoint of each node, which is scalable to any
asymmetric network of any size with a fixed message length per node. The
convergence analysis of these algorithms is subsequently provided under some
weak assumptions. The efficiency of the developed algorithms in computing the
network connectivity is then demonstrated by simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Malicious software is an integral part of cybercrime defense. Due to the
growing number of malicious attacks and their target sources, detecting and
preventing the attack becomes more challenging due to the assault's changing
behavior. The bulk of classic malware detection systems is based on statistics,
analytic techniques, or machine learning. Virus signature methods are widely
used to identify malware. The bulk of anti-malware systems categorizes malware
using regular expressions and patterns. While antivirus software is less likely
to update its databases to identify and block malware, file features must be
updated to detect and prevent newly generated malware. Creating attack
signatures requires practically all of a human being's work. The purpose of
this study is to undertake a review of the current research on intrusion
detection models and the datasets that support them. In this article, we
discuss the state-of-the-art, focusing on the strategy that was devised and
executed, the dataset that was utilized, the findings, and the assessment that
was undertaken. Additionally, the surveyed articles undergo critical analysis
and statements in order to give a thorough comparative review. Machine learning
and deep learning methods, as well as new classification and feature selection
methodologies, are studied and researched. Thus far, each technique has proved
the capability of constructing very accurate intrusion detection models. The
survey findings reveal that Clearly, the MultiTree and adaptive voting
algorithms surpassed all other models in terms of persistency and performance,
averaging 99.98 percent accuracy on average.

coupling multi-physical simulations performed in different simulation programs.
For instance, by considering a forward-coupling of a surface vibration
simulation (mechanical system) to an acoustic propagation simulation using
time-dependent acoustic absorbing material as a noise mitigation measure. The
nearest-neighbor search of the target and source points from the interpolation
is performed using the FLANN or the CGAL library. In doing so, the coupled
field (e.g., surface velocity) is interpolated from a source representation
consisting of field values physically stored and organized in a file directory
to a target representation being the quadrature points in the case of the
finite element method. A test case of the functionality is presented in the
"testsuite" module of the openCFS software called "Abc2dcsvt". This scattered
data reader module was successfully applied in numerous studies on flow-induced
sound generation. Within this short article, the functionality, and usability
of this module are described.

<p class="mathjax">Metric spaces $(X, d)$ are ubiquitous objects in mathematics and computer
science that allow for capturing (pairwise) distance relationships $d(x, y)$
between points $x, y \in X$. Because of this, it is natural to ask what useful
generalizations there are of metric spaces for capturing "$k$-wise distance
relationships" $d(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ among points $x_1, \ldots, x_k \in X$ for
$k &gt; 2$. To that end, G\"{a}hler (Math. Nachr., 1963) (and perhaps others even
earlier) defined $k$-metric spaces, which generalize metric spaces, and most
notably generalize the triangle inequality $d(x_1, x_2) \leq d(x_1, y) + d(y,
x_2)$ to the "simplex inequality" $d(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \leq \sum_{i=1}^k d(x_1,
\ldots, x_{i-1}, y, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_k)$. (The definition holds for any fixed
$k \geq 2$, and a $2$-metric space is just a (standard) metric space.)
<br />In this work, we introduce strong $k$-metric spaces, $k$-metric spaces that
satisfy a topological condition stronger than the simplex inequality, which
makes them "behave nicely." We also introduce coboundary $k$-metrics, which
generalize $\ell_p$ metrics (and in fact all finite metric spaces induced by
norms) and minimum bounding chain $k$-metrics, which generalize shortest path
metrics (and capture all strong $k$-metrics). Using these definitions, we prove
analogs of a number of fundamental results about embedding finite metric spaces
including Fr\'{e}chet embedding (isometric embedding into $\ell_{\infty}$) and
isometric embedding of all tree metrics into $\ell_1$. We also study
relationships between families of (strong) $k$-metrics, and show that natural
quantities, like simplex volume, are strong $k$-metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Tsunamis can trigger internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the ionosphere,
perturbing the Total Electron Content (TEC) - referred to as Traveling
Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) that are detectable through the Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The GNSS are constellations of satellites
providing signals from Earth orbit - Europe's Galileo, the United States'
Global Positioning System (GPS), Russia's Global'naya Navigatsionnaya
Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) and China's BeiDou. The real-time detection of
TIDs provides an approach for tsunami detection, enhancing early warning
systems by providing open-ocean coverage in geographic areas not serviceable by
buoy-based warning systems. Large volumes of the GNSS data is leveraged by deep
learning, which effectively handles complex non-linear relationships across
thousands of data streams. We describe a framework leveraging slant total
electron content (sTEC) from the VARION (Variometric Approach for Real-Time
Ionosphere Observation) algorithm by Gramian Angular Difference Fields (from
Computer Vision) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect TIDs in
near-real-time. Historical data from the 2010 Maule, 2011 Tohoku and the 2012
Haida-Gwaii earthquakes and tsunamis are used in model training, and the
later-occurring 2015 Illapel earthquake and tsunami in Chile for out-of-sample
model validation. Using the experimental framework described in the paper, we
achieved a 91.7% F1 score. Source code is available at:
https://github.com/vc1492a/tidd. Our work represents a new frontier in
detecting tsunami-driven IGWs in open-ocean, dramatically improving the
potential for natural hazards detection for coastal communities.

<p class="mathjax">This comprehensive review systematically evaluates Machine Learning (ML)
methodologies employed in the detection, prediction, and analysis of mental
stress and its consequent mental disorders (MDs). Utilizing a rigorous scoping
review process, the investigation delves into the latest ML algorithms,
preprocessing techniques, and data types employed in the context of stress and
stress-related MDs. The findings highlight that Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Neural Network (NN), and Random Forest (RF) models consistently exhibit
superior accuracy and robustness among all machine learning algorithms
examined. Furthermore, the review underscores that physiological parameters,
such as heart rate measurements and skin response, are prevalently used as
stress predictors in ML algorithms. This is attributed to their rich
explanatory information concerning stress and stress-related MDs, as well as
the relative ease of data acquisition. Additionally, the application of
dimensionality reduction techniques, including mappings, feature selection,
filtering, and noise reduction, is frequently observed as a crucial step
preceding the training of ML algorithms. The synthesis of this review
identifies significant research gaps and outlines future directions for the
field. These encompass areas such as model interpretability, model
personalization, the incorporation of naturalistic settings, and real-time
processing capabilities for detection and prediction of stress and
stress-related MDs.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans), where an
attacker poisons the training set with backdoor triggers so that the neural
network learns to classify test-time triggers to the attacker's designated
target class. Recent work shows that backdoor poisoning induces over-fitting
(abnormally large activations) in the attacked model, which motivates a
general, post-training clipping method for backdoor mitigation, i.e., with
bounds on internal-layer activations learned using a small set of clean
samples. We devise a new such approach, choosing the activation bounds to
explicitly limit classification margins. This method gives superior performance
against peer methods for CIFAR-10 image classification. We also show that this
method has strong robustness against adaptive attacks, X2X attacks, and on
different datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a method extension for test-time
detection and correction based on the output differences between the original
and activation-bounded networks. The code of our method is online available.

<p class="mathjax">3D understanding and rendering of moving humans from monocular videos is a
challenging task. Despite recent progress, the task remains difficult in
real-world scenarios, where obstacles may block the camera view and cause
partial occlusions in the captured videos. Existing methods cannot handle such
defects due to two reasons. First, the standard rendering strategy relies on
point-point mapping, which could lead to dramatic disparities between the
visible and occluded areas of the body. Second, the naive direct regression
approach does not consider any feasibility criteria (ie, prior information) for
rendering under occlusions. To tackle the above drawbacks, we present OccNeRF,
a neural rendering method that achieves better rendering of humans in severely
occluded scenes. As direct solutions to the two drawbacks, we propose
surface-based rendering by integrating geometry and visibility priors. We
validate our method on both simulated and real-world occlusions and demonstrate
our method's superiority.

capabilities. We propose a novel algorithm, staged speculative decoding, to
accelerate LLM inference in small-batch, on-device scenarios. We address the
low arithmetic intensity of small-batch inference by improving upon previous
work in speculative decoding. First, we restructure the speculative batch as a
tree, which reduces generation costs and increases the expected tokens per
batch. Second, we add a second stage of speculative decoding. Taken together,
we reduce single-batch decoding latency by 3.16x with a 762M parameter GPT-2-L

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous conversational agents, i.e. chatbots, are becoming an increasingly
common mechanism for enterprises to provide support to customers and partners.
In order to rate chatbots, especially ones powered by Generative AI tools like
Large Language Models (LLMs) we need to be able to accurately assess their
performance. This is where chatbot benchmarking becomes important. In this
paper, we propose the use of a novel benchmark that we call the E2E (End to
End) benchmark, and show how the E2E benchmark can be used to evaluate accuracy
and usefulness of the answers provided by chatbots, especially ones powered by
LLMs. We evaluate an example chatbot at different levels of sophistication
based on both our E2E benchmark, as well as other available metrics commonly
used in the state of art, and observe that the proposed benchmark show better
results compared to others. In addition, while some metrics proved to be
unpredictable, the metric associated with the E2E benchmark, which uses cosine
similarity performed well in evaluating chatbots. The performance of our best
models shows that there are several benefits of using the cosine similarity
score as a metric in the E2E benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Analyzing the pattern of semantic variation in long real-world texts such as
books or transcripts is interesting from the stylistic, cognitive, and
linguistic perspectives. It is also useful for applications such as text
segmentation, document summarization, and detection of semantic novelty. The
recent emergence of several vector-space methods for sentence embedding has
made such analysis feasible. However, this raises the issue of how consistent
and meaningful the semantic representations produced by various methods are in
themselves. In this paper, we compare several recent sentence embedding methods
via time-series of semantic similarity between successive sentences and
matrices of pairwise sentence similarity for multiple books of literature. In
contrast to previous work using target tasks and curated datasets to compare
sentence embedding methods, our approach provides an evaluation of the methods
'in the wild'. We find that most of the sentence embedding methods considered
do infer highly correlated patterns of semantic similarity in a given document,
but show interesting differences.

<p class="mathjax">Vehicle automation technology has made significant progress, laying the
groundwork for a future of fully automated vehicles. This paper delves into the
operation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). In prior work, we
developed a controller that includes a tunable gain whose value significantly
influences CAV performance and, in particular, its acceleration. By varying
this gain, CAV acceleration is associated with different values depending on
some initial conditions. Thus, our goal in this paper is to identify the
optimal value of this gain in terms of acceleration for any group of initial
conditions. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem where the
decision variable is the gain value, and the objective function includes the
acceleration of the vehicles. The complexity of this problem prohibits
real-time solutions. To address this challenge, we train a neural network to
map different initial conditions to the optimal gain values efficiently. We
showcase the proposed approach to deriving the optimal gains in a merging
scenario with an on-ramp.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI, in particular text-based "foundation models" (large models
trained on a huge variety of information including the internet), can generate
speech that could be problematic under a wide range of liability regimes.
Machine learning practitioners regularly "red team" models to identify and
mitigate such problematic speech: from "hallucinations" falsely accusing people
of serious misconduct to recipes for constructing an atomic bomb. A key
question is whether these red-teamed behaviors actually present any liability
risk for model creators and deployers under U.S. law, incentivizing investments
in safety mechanisms. We examine three liability regimes, tying them to common
examples of red-teamed model behaviors: defamation, speech integral to criminal
conduct, and wrongful death. We find that any Section 230 immunity analysis or
downstream liability analysis is intimately wrapped up in the technical details
of algorithm design. And there are many roadblocks to truly finding models (and
their associated parties) liable for generated speech. We argue that AI should
not be categorically immune from liability in these scenarios and that as
courts grapple with the already fine-grained complexities of platform
algorithms, the technical details of generative AI loom above with thornier
questions. Courts and policymakers should think carefully about what technical
design incentives they create as they evaluate these issues.

<p class="mathjax">Compressed Neural Networks have the potential to enable deep learning across
new applications and smaller computational environments. However, understanding
the range of learning tasks in which such models can succeed is not well
studied. In this work, we apply sparse and binary-weighted Transformers to
multivariate time series problems, showing that the lightweight models achieve
accuracy comparable to that of dense floating-point Transformers of the same
structure. Our model achieves favorable results across three time series
learning tasks: classification, anomaly detection, and single-step forecasting.
Additionally, to reduce the computational complexity of the attention
mechanism, we apply two modifications, which show little to no decline in model
performance: 1) in the classification task, we apply a fixed mask to the query,
key, and value activations, and 2) for forecasting and anomaly detection, which
rely on predicting outputs at a single point in time, we propose an attention
mask to allow computation only at the current time step. Together, each
compression technique and attention modification substantially reduces the
number of non-zero operations necessary in the Transformer. We measure the
computational savings of our approach over a range of metrics including
parameter count, bit size, and floating point operation (FLOPs) count, showing
up to a 53x reduction in storage size and up to 10.5x reduction in FLOPs.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR place recognition approaches based on deep learning suffer a
significant degradation in performance when there is a shift between the
distribution of the training and testing datasets, with re-training often
required to achieve top performance. However, obtaining accurate ground truth
on new environments can be prohibitively expensive, especially in complex or
GPS-deprived environments. To address this issue we propose GeoAdapt, which
introduces a novel auxiliary classification head to generate pseudo-labels for
re-training on unseen environments in a self-supervised manner. GeoAdapt uses
geometric consistency as a prior to improve the robustness of our generated
pseudo-labels against domain shift, improving the performance and reliability
of our Test-Time Adaptation approach. Comprehensive experiments show that
GeoAdapt significantly boosts place recognition performance across moderate to
severe domain shifts, and is competitive with fully supervised test-time
adaptation approaches. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/csiro-robotics/GeoAdapt.

<p class="mathjax">For prohibitively large-scale Travelling Salesman Problems (TSPs), existing
algorithms face big challenges in terms of both computational efficiency and
solution quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical
destroy-and-repair (HDR) approach, which attempts to improve an initial
solution by applying a series of carefully designed destroy-and-repair
operations. A key innovative concept is the hierarchical search framework,
which recursively fixes partial edges and compresses the input instance into a
small-scale TSP under some equivalence guarantee. This neat search framework is
able to deliver highly competitive solutions within a reasonable time. Fair
comparisons based on nineteen famous large-scale instances (with 10,000 to
10,000,000 cities) show that HDR is highly competitive against existing
state-of-the-art TSP algorithms, in terms of both efficiency and solution
quality. Notably, on two large instances with 3,162,278 and 10,000,000 cities,
HDR breaks the world records (i.e., best-known results regardless of
computation time), which were previously achieved by LKH and its variants,
while HDR is completely independent of LKH. Finally, ablation studies are
performed to certify the importance and validity of the hierarchical search
framework.

<p class="mathjax">Software-defined network (SDN) is characterized by its programmability,
flexibility, and the separation of control and data planes. However, SDN still
have many challenges, particularly concerning the security of network
information synchronization and network element registration. Blockchain and
intent-driven networks are recent technologies to establish secure and
intelligent SDN. This article investigates the blockchain-based architecture
and intent-driven mechanisms to implement intent-driven security
software-defined networks (IS2N). Specifically, we propose a novel four-layer
architecture of the IS2N with security capabilities. We integrate an
intent-driven security management mechanism in the IS2N to achieve automate
network security management. Finally, we develop an IS2N platform with
blockchain middle-layer to achieve security capabilities and security store
network-level snapshots, such as device registration and OpenFlow messages. Our
simulations show that IS2N is more flexible than conventional strategies at
resolving problems during network operations and has a minimal effect on the
SDN.

<p class="mathjax">Gestures form an important medium of communication between humans and
machines. An overwhelming majority of existing gesture recognition methods are
tailored to a scenario where humans and machines are located very close to each
other. This short-distance assumption does not hold true for several types of
interactions, for example gesture-based interactions with a floor cleaning
robot or with a drone. Methods made for short-distance recognition are unable
to perform well on long-distance recognition due to gestures occupying only a
small portion of the input data. Their performance is especially worse in
resource constrained settings where they are not able to effectively focus
their limited compute on the gesturing subject. We propose a novel, accurate
and efficient method for the recognition of gestures from longer distances. It
uses a dynamic neural network to select features from gesture-containing
spatial regions of the input sensor data for further processing. This helps the
network focus on features important for gesture recognition while discarding
background features early on, thus making it more compute efficient compared to
other techniques. We demonstrate the performance of our method on the LD-ConGR
long-distance dataset where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on
recognition accuracy and compute efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Constituency parsing plays a fundamental role in advancing natural language
processing (NLP) tasks. However, training an automatic syntactic analysis
system for ancient languages solely relying on annotated parse data is a
formidable task due to the inherent challenges in building treebanks for such
languages. It demands extensive linguistic expertise, leading to a scarcity of
available resources. To overcome this hurdle, cross-lingual transfer techniques
which require minimal or even no annotated data for low-resource target
languages offer a promising solution. In this study, we focus on building a
constituency parser for $\mathbf{M}$iddle $\mathbf{H}$igh $\mathbf{G}$erman
$\mathbf{MHG}$ under realistic conditions, where no annotated MHG treebank is
available for training. In our approach, we leverage the linguistic continuity
and structural similarity between MHG and $\mathbf{M}$odern $\mathbf{G}$erman
$\mathbf{MG}$, along with the abundance of MG treebank resources. Specifically,
by employing the $\mathit{delexicalization}$ method, we train a constituency
parser on MG parse datasets and perform cross-lingual transfer to MHG parsing.
Our delexicalized constituency parser demonstrates remarkable performance on
the MHG test set, achieving an F1-score of 67.3%. It outperforms the best
zero-shot cross-lingual baseline by a margin of 28.6% points. These encouraging
results underscore the practicality and potential for automatic syntactic
analysis in other ancient languages that face similar challenges as MHG.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithms to solve fault-tolerant consensus in asynchronous systems often
rely on primitives such as crusader agreement, adopt-commit, and graded
broadcast, which provide weaker agreement properties than consensus. Although
these primitives have a similar flavor, they have been defined and implemented
separately in ad hoc ways. We propose a new problem called connected consensus
that has as special cases crusader agreement, adopt-commit, and graded
broadcast, and generalizes them to handle multi-valued inputs. The
generalization is accomplished by relating the problem to approximate agreement
on graphs.
<br />We present three algorithms for multi-valued connected consensus in
asynchronous message-passing systems, one tolerating crash failures and two
tolerating malicious (unauthenticated Byzantine) failures. We extend the
definition of binding, a desirable property recently identified as supporting
binary consensus algorithms that are correct against adaptive adversaries, to
the multi-valued input case and show that all our algorithms satisfy the
property. Our crash-resilient algorithm has failure-resilience and time
complexity that we show are optimal. When restricted to the case of binary
inputs, the algorithm has improved time complexity over prior algorithms. Our
two algorithms for malicious failures trade off failure resilience and time
complexity. The first algorithm has time complexity that we prove is optimal
but worse failure-resilience, while the second has failure-resilience that we
prove is optimal but worse time complexity. When restricted to the case of
binary inputs, the time complexity (as well as resilience) of the second
algorithm matches that of prior algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Homomorphic encryption (HE) has found extensive utilization in federated
learning (FL) systems, capitalizing on its dual advantages: (i) ensuring the
confidentiality of shared models contributed by participating entities, and
(ii) enabling algebraic operations directly on ciphertexts representing
encrypted models. Particularly, the approximate fully homomorphic encryption
(FHE) scheme, known as CKKS, has emerged as the de facto encryption scheme,
notably supporting decimal numbers. While recent research predominantly focuses
on enhancing CKKS's encryption rate and evaluation speed in the context of FL,
the search operation has been relatively disregarded due to the tendency of
some applications to discard intermediate encrypted models. Yet, emerging
studies emphasize the importance of managing and searching intermediate models
for specific applications like large-scale scientific computing, necessitating
robust data provenance and auditing support. To address this, our paper
introduces an innovative approach that efficiently searches for a target
encrypted value, incurring only a logarithmic number of network interactions.
The proposed method capitalizes on CKKS's additive and multiplicative
properties on encrypted models, propagating equality comparisons between values
through a balanced binary tree structure to ultimately reach a single
aggregate. A comprehensive analysis of the proposed algorithm underscores its
potential to significantly broaden FL's applicability and impact.

<p class="mathjax">Heart failure is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people
worldwide and has a significant impact on their quality of life and mortality
rates. An objective assessment of cardiac pressures remains an important method
for the diagnosis and treatment prognostication for patients with heart
failure. Although cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for estimating
central hemodynamic pressures, it is an invasive procedure that carries
inherent risks, making it a potentially dangerous procedure for some patients.
Approaches that leverage non-invasive signals - such as electrocardiogram (ECG)
- have the promise to make the routine estimation of cardiac pressures feasible
in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Prior models trained to estimate
intracardiac pressures (e.g., mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mPCWP))
in a supervised fashion have shown good discriminatory ability but have been
limited to the labeled dataset from the heart failure cohort. To address this
issue and build a robust representation, we apply deep metric learning (DML)
and propose a novel self-supervised DML with distance-based mining that
improves the performance of a model with limited labels. We use a dataset that
contains over 5.4 million ECGs without concomitant central pressure labels to
pre-train a self-supervised DML model which showed improved classification of
elevated mPCWP compared to self-supervised contrastive baselines. Additionally,
the supervised DML model that is using ECGs with access to 8,172 mPCWP labels
demonstrated significantly better performance on the mPCWP regression task
compared to the supervised baseline. Moreover, our data suggest that DML yields
models that are performant across patient subgroups, even when some patient
subgroups are under-represented in the dataset. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Since the introduction of the Vision Transformer (ViT), researchers have
sought to make ViTs more efficient by removing redundant information in the
processed tokens. While different methods have been explored to achieve this
goal, we still lack understanding of the resulting reduction patterns and how
those patterns differ across token reduction methods and datasets. To close
this gap, we set out to understand the reduction patterns of 10 different token
reduction methods using four image classification datasets. By systematically
comparing these methods on the different classification tasks, we find that the
Top-K pruning method is a surprisingly strong baseline. Through in-depth
analysis of the different methods, we determine that: the reduction patterns
are generally not consistent when varying the capacity of the backbone model,
the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods significantly differ from fixed
radial patterns, and the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods are
correlated across classification datasets. Finally we report that the
similarity of reduction patterns is a moderate-to-strong proxy for model
performance. Project page at https://vap.aau.dk/tokens.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian optimization (BO) is widely adopted in black-box optimization
problems and it relies on a surrogate model to approximate the black-box
response function. With the increasing number of black-box optimization tasks
solved and even more to solve, the ability to learn from multiple prior tasks
to jointly pre-train a surrogate model is long-awaited to further boost
optimization efficiency. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to
pre-train a surrogate, which is a Gaussian process (GP) with a kernel defined
on deep features learned from a Transformer-based encoder, using datasets from
prior tasks with possibly heterogeneous input spaces. In addition, we provide a
simple yet effective mix-up initialization strategy for input tokens
corresponding to unseen input variables and therefore accelerate new tasks'
convergence. Experiments on both synthetic and real benchmark problems
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pre-training and transfer BO
strategy over existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Matrix factorization (MF) is a classical collaborative filtering algorithm
for recommender systems. It decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into a
product of low-dimensional user representation matrix and item representation
matrix. In typical recommendation scenarios, the user-item interaction paradigm
is usually a two-stage process and requires static clustering analysis of the
obtained user and item representations. The above process, however, is time and
computationally intensive, making it difficult to apply in real-time to
e-commerce or Internet of Things environments with billions of users and
trillions of items. To address this, we propose a unified matrix factorization
method based on dynamic multi-view clustering (MFDMC) that employs an
end-to-end training paradigm. Specifically, in each view, a user/item
representation is regarded as a weighted projection of all clusters. The
representation of each cluster is learnable, enabling the dynamic discarding of
bad clusters. Furthermore, we employ multi-view clustering to represent
multiple roles of users/items, effectively utilizing the representation space
and improving the interpretability of the user/item representations for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed MFDMC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world recommendation datasets.
Additionally, comprehensive visualization and ablation studies interpretably
confirm that our method provides meaningful representations for downstream
tasks of users/items.

<p class="mathjax">To avoid potential risks posed by vulnerabilities in third-party libraries,
security researchers maintain vulnerability databases (e.g., NVD) containing
vulnerability reports, each of which records the description of a vulnerability
and the name list of libraries affected by the vulnerability (a.k.a. vulnerable
libraries). However, recent studies on about 200,000 vulnerability reports in
NVD show that 53.3% of these reports do not include the name list of vulnerable
libraries, and 59.82% of the included name lists of vulnerable libraries are
incomplete or incorrect.
<br />To address the preceding issue, in this paper, we propose the first
generative approach named VulLibGen to generate the name list of vulnerable
libraries (out of all the existing libraries) for the given vulnerability by
utilizing recent enormous advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), in order to
achieve high accuracy. VulLibGen takes only the description of a vulnerability
as input and achieves high identification accuracy based on LLMs' prior
knowledge of all the existing libraries. VulLibGen also includes the input
augmentation technique to help identify zero-shot vulnerable libraries (those
not occurring during training) and the post-processing technique to help
address VulLibGen's hallucinations. We evaluate VulLibGen using three
state-of-the-art/practice approaches (LightXML, Chronos, and VulLibMiner) that
identify vulnerable libraries on an open-source dataset (VulLib). Our
evaluation results show that VulLibGen can accurately identify vulnerable
libraries with an average F1 score of 0.626 while the state-of-the-art/practice
approaches achieve only 0.561. The post-processing technique helps VulLibGen
achieve an average improvement of F1@1 by 9.3%. The input augmentation
technique helps VulLibGen achieve an average improvement of F1@1 by 39% in
identifying zero-shot libraries.

<p class="mathjax">Lyrics generation is a well-known application in natural language generation
research, with several previous studies focusing on generating accurate lyrics
using precise control such as keywords, rhymes, etc. However, lyrics imitation,
which involves writing new lyrics by imitating the style and content of the
source lyrics, remains a challenging task due to the lack of a parallel corpus.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{\textit{Sudowoodo}}, a Chinese lyrics
imitation system that can generate new lyrics based on the text of source
lyrics. To address the issue of lacking a parallel training corpus for lyrics
imitation, we propose a novel framework to construct a parallel corpus based on
a keyword-based lyrics model from source lyrics. Then the pairs \textit{(new
lyrics, source lyrics)} are used to train the lyrics imitation model. During
the inference process, we utilize a post-processing module to filter and rank
the generated lyrics, selecting the highest-quality ones. We incorporated audio
information and aligned the lyrics with the audio to form the songs as a bonus.
The human evaluation results show that our framework can perform better lyric
imitation. Meanwhile, the \textit{Sudowoodo} system and demo video of the

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of self-supervised representation (i.e., wav2vec 2.0) allows
speaker-recognition approaches to process spoken signals through foundation
models built on speech data. Nevertheless, effective fusion on the
representation requires further investigating, due to the inclusion of fixed or
sub-optimal temporal pooling strategies. Despite of improved strategies
considering graph learning and graph attention factors, non-injective
aggregation still exists in the approaches, which may influence the performance
for speaker recognition. In this regard, we propose a speaker recognition
approach using Isomorphic Graph ATtention network (IsoGAT) on self-supervised
representation. The proposed approach contains three modules of representation
learning, graph attention, and aggregation, jointly considering learning on the
self-supervised representation and the IsoGAT. Then, we perform experiments for
speaker recognition tasks on VoxCeleb1\&amp;2 datasets, with the corresponding
experimental results demonstrating the recognition performance for the proposed
approach, compared with existing pooling approaches on the self-supervised
representation.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, a variety of Neural radiance fields methods have garnered
remarkable success in high render speed. However, current accelerating methods
is specialized and not compatible for various implicit method, which prevent a
real-time composition over different kinds of NeRF works. Since NeRF relies on
sampling along rays, it's possible to provide a guidance generally. We propose
a general implicit pipeline to rapidly compose NeRF objects. This new method
enables the casting of dynamic shadows within or between objects using
analytical light sources while allowing multiple NeRF objects to be seamlessly
placed and rendered together with any arbitrary rigid transformations. Mainly,
our work introduces a new surface representation known as Neural Depth Fields
(NeDF) that quickly determines the spatial relationship between objects by
allowing direct intersection computation between rays and implicit surfaces. It
leverages an intersection neural network to query NeRF for acceleration instead
of depending on an explicit spatial structure.Our proposed method is the first
to enable both the progressive and interactive composition of NeRF objects.
Additionally, it also serves as a previewing plugin for a range of existing
NeRF works.

<p class="mathjax">Precisely reconstructing and manipulating crumpled cloths is challenging due
to the high dimensionality of the cloth model, as well as the limited
observation at self-occluded regions. We leverage the recent progress in the
field of single-view human body reconstruction to template-based reconstruct
the crumpled cloths from their top-view depth observations only, with our
proposed sim-real registration protocols. In contrast to previous implicit
cloth representations, our reconstruction mesh explicitly indicates the
positions and visibilities of the entire cloth mesh vertices, enabling more
efficient dual-arm and single-arm target-oriented manipulations. Experiments
demonstrate that our template-based reconstruction and target-oriented
manipulation (TRTM) system can be applied to daily cloths with similar
topologies as our template mesh, but have different shapes, sizes, patterns,
and physical properties. Videos, datasets, pre-trained models, and code can be

<p class="mathjax">Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the characteristics of
event-driven and high energy-efficient, which are different from traditional
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) when deployed on edge devices such as
neuromorphic chips. Most previous work focuses on SNNs training strategies to
improve model performance and brings larger and deeper network architectures.
It is difficult to deploy these complex networks on resource-limited edge
devices directly. To meet such demand, people compress SNNs very cautiously to
balance the performance and the computation efficiency. Existing compression
methods either iteratively pruned SNNs using weights norm magnitude or
formulated the problem as a sparse learning optimization. We propose an
improved end-to-end Minimax optimization method for this sparse learning
problem to better balance the model performance and the computation efficiency.
We also demonstrate that jointly applying compression and finetuning on SNNs is
better than sequentially, especially for extreme compression ratios. The
compressed SNN models achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various
benchmark datasets and architectures. Our code is available at
https://github.com/chenjallen/Resource-Constrained-Compression-on-SNN.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) which leverages unlabeled datasets for
pre-training powerful encoders has achieved significant success in recent
years. These encoders are commonly used as feature extractors for various
downstream tasks, requiring substantial data and computing resources for their
training process. With the deployment of pre-trained encoders in commercial
use, protecting the intellectual property of model owners and ensuring the
trustworthiness of the models becomes crucial. Recent research has shown that
encoders are threatened by backdoor attacks, adversarial attacks, etc.
Therefore, a scheme to verify the integrity of pre-trained encoders is needed
to protect users. In this paper, we propose SSL-Auth, the first fragile
watermarking scheme for verifying the integrity of encoders without
compromising model performance. Our method utilizes selected key samples as
watermark information and trains a verification network to reconstruct the
watermark information, thereby verifying the integrity of the encoder. By
comparing the reconstruction results of the key samples, malicious
modifications can be effectively detected, as altered models should not exhibit
similar reconstruction performance as the original models. Extensive
evaluations on various models and diverse datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and fragility of our proposed SSL-Auth.

<p class="mathjax">Fairness in deep learning models trained with high-dimensional inputs and
subjective labels remains a complex and understudied area. Facial emotion
recognition, a domain where datasets are often racially imbalanced, can lead to
models that yield disparate outcomes across racial groups. This study focuses
on analyzing racial bias by sub-sampling training sets with varied racial
distributions and assessing test performance across these simulations. Our
findings indicate that smaller datasets with posed faces improve on both
fairness and performance metrics as the simulations approach racial balance.
Notably, the F1-score increases by $27.2\%$ points, and demographic parity
increases by $15.7\%$ points on average across the simulations. However, in
larger datasets with greater facial variation, fairness metrics generally
remain constant, suggesting that racial balance by itself is insufficient to
achieve parity in test performance across different racial groups.

<p class="mathjax">It is anticipated that integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), resulting in RIS-assisted UAV
networks, will offer improved network connectivity against node failures for
the beyond 5G networks. In this context, we utilize a RIS to provide path
diversity and alternative connectivity options for information flow from user
equipment (UE) to UAVs by adding more links to the network, thereby maximizing
its connectivity. This paper employs the algebraic connectivity metric, which
is adjusted by the reflected links of the RIS, to formulate the problem of
maximizing the network connectivity in two cases. First, we consider
formulating the problem for one UE, which is solved optimally using a linear
search. Then, we consider the problem of a more general case of multiple UEs,
which has high computational complexity. To tackle this problem, we formulate
the problem of maximizing the network connectivity as a semi-definite
programming (SDP) optimization problem that can be solved efficiently in
polynomial time. In both cases, our proposed solutions find the best
combination between UE(s) and UAVs through the RIS. As a result, it tunes the
phase shifts of the RIS to direct the signals of the UEs to the appropriate
UAVs, thus maximizing the network connectivity. Simulation results are
conducted to assess the performance of the proposed solutions compared to the
existing solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across wide
range of downstream tasks. This competency is attributed to their substantial
parameter size and pre-training on extensive corpus. Moreover, LLMs have
exhibited enhanced reasoning capabilities in tackling complex reasoning tasks,
owing to the utilization of a method named ``Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting''. This method is designed to generate intermediate reasoning steps
that guide the inference of the final answer. However, it is essential to
highlight that these advanced reasoning abilities appear to emerge in models
with a minimum of 10 billion parameters, thereby limiting its efficacy in
situations where computational resources are constrained. In this paper, we
investigate the possibility of transferring the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
to smaller models via knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose Sci-CoT,
a two-stage framework that separates the processes of generating rationales and
inferring answers. This method enables a more efficient use of rationales
during the answer inference stage, leading to improved performance on
scientific question-answering tasks. Utilizing Sci-CoT, our 80-million
parameter model is able to exceed the performance of BLOOM-176B in the ARC-Easy
dataset under the few shot setting.

<p class="mathjax">Real-world single image denoising is crucial and practical in computer
vision. Bayesian inversions combined with score priors now have proven
effective for single image denoising but are limited to white Gaussian noise.
Moreover, applying existing score-based methods for real-world denoising
requires not only the explicit train of score priors on the target domain but
also the careful design of sampling procedures for posterior inference, which
is complicated and impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a
score priors-guided deep variational inference, namely ScoreDVI, for practical
real-world denoising. By considering the deep variational image posterior with
a Gaussian form, score priors are extracted based on easily accessible minimum
MSE Non-$i.i.d$ Gaussian denoisers and variational samples, which in turn
facilitate optimizing the variational image posterior. Such a procedure
adaptively applies cheap score priors to denoising. Additionally, we exploit a
Non-$i.i.d$ Gaussian mixture model and variational noise posterior to model the
real-world noise. This scheme also enables the pixel-wise fusion of multiple
image priors and variational image posteriors. Besides, we develop a
noise-aware prior assignment strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of
image priors in the optimization. Our method outperforms other single
image-based real-world denoising methods and achieves comparable performance to
dataset-based unsupervised methods.

<p class="mathjax">While the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical image analysis is
gaining wide acceptance, the expertise, time and cost required to generate
annotated data in the medical field are significantly high, due to limited
availability of both data and expert annotation. Strongly supervised object
localization models require data that is exhaustively annotated, meaning all
objects of interest in an image are identified. This is difficult to achieve
and verify for medical images. We present a method for the transformation of
real data to train any Deep Neural Network to solve the above problems. We show
the efficacy of this approach on both a weakly supervised localization model
and a strongly supervised localization model. For the weakly supervised model,
we show that the localization accuracy increases significantly using the
generated data. For the strongly supervised model, this approach overcomes the
need for exhaustive annotation on real images. In the latter model, we show
that the accuracy, when trained with generated images, closely parallels the
accuracy when trained with exhaustively annotated real images. The results are
demonstrated on images of human urine samples obtained using microscopy.

<p class="mathjax">Crossword puzzles have traditionally served not only as entertainment but
also as an educational tool that can be used to acquire vocabulary and language
proficiency. One strategy to enhance the educational purpose is
personalization, such as including more words on a particular topic. This paper
focuses on the case of encouraging people's interest in news and proposes a
framework for automatically generating news-centric crossword puzzles. We
designed possible scenarios and built a prototype as a constraint satisfaction
and optimization problem, that is, containing as many news-derived words as
possible. Our experiments reported the generation probabilities and time
required under several conditions. The results showed that news-centric
crossword puzzles can be generated even with few news-derived words. We
summarize the current issues and future research directions through a
qualitative evaluation of the prototype. This is the first proposal that a
formulation of a constraint satisfaction and optimization problem can be
beneficial as an educational application.

daily. In this paper, we introduce the search engines working for keywords that
are entered by users to find something. The search engine uses different search
algorithms for convenient results for providing to the net surfer. Net surfers
go with the top search results but how did the results of web pages get higher
ranks over search engines? how the search engine got that all the web pages in
the database? This paper gives the answers to all these kinds of basic
questions. Web crawlers working for search engines and robot exclusion protocol

<p class="mathjax">Partial differential equations (PDEs) underlie our understanding and
prediction of natural phenomena across numerous fields, including physics,
engineering, and finance. However, solving parametric PDEs is a complex task
that necessitates efficient numerical methods. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for solving parametric PDEs using a Finite Element Operator
Network (FEONet). Our proposed method leverages the power of deep learning in
conjunction with traditional numerical methods, specifically the finite element
method, to solve parametric PDEs in the absence of any paired input-output
training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several
benchmark problems and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and computational flexibility.
Our FEONet framework shows potential for application in various fields where
PDEs play a crucial role in modeling complex domains with diverse boundary
conditions and singular behavior. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
convergence analysis to support our approach, utilizing finite element
approximation in numerical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is widely applied in software engineering
tasks. The effectiveness of NMT for code retrieval relies on the ability to
learn from the sequence of tokens in the source language to the sequence of
tokens in the target language. While NMT performs well in pseudocode-to-code
translation, it might have challenges in learning to translate from natural
language query to source code in newly curated real-world code documentation/
implementation datasets. In this work, we analyze the performance of NMT in
natural language-to-code translation in the newly curated CAT benchmark that
includes the optimized versions of three Java datasets TLCodeSum,
CodeSearchNet, Funcom, and a Python dataset PCSD. Our evaluation shows that NMT
has low accuracy, measured by CrystalBLEU and Meteor metrics in this task. To
alleviate the duty of NMT in learning complex representation of source code, we
propose ASTTrans Representation, a tailored representation of an Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST) using a subset of non-terminal nodes. We show that the
classical approach NMT performs significantly better in learning ASTTrans
Representation over code tokens with up to 36% improvement on Meteor score.
Moreover, we leverage ASTTrans Representation to conduct combined code search
processes from the state-of-the-art code search processes using GraphCodeBERT
and UniXcoder. Our NMT models of learning ASTTrans Representation can boost the
Mean Reciprocal Rank of these state-of-the-art code search processes by up to
3.08% and improve 23.08% of queries' results over the CAT benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">An $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph is \emph{$k$-vertex connected} if it cannot be
disconnected by deleting less than $k$ vertices. After more than half a century
of intensive research, the result by [Li et al. STOC'21] finally gave a
\emph{randomized} algorithm for checking $k$-connectivity in near-optimal
$\widehat{O}(m)$ time. (We use $\widehat{O}(\cdot)$ to hide an $n^{o(1)}$
factor.) Deterministic algorithms, unfortunately, have remained much slower
even if we assume a linear-time max-flow algorithm: they either require at
least $\Omega(mn)$ time [Even'75; Henzinger Rao and Gabow, FOCS'96; Gabow,
FOCS'00] or assume that $k=o(\sqrt{\log n})$ [Saranurak and
Yingchareonthawornchai, FOCS'22]. We show a \emph{deterministic} algorithm for
checking $k$-vertex connectivity in time proportional to making
$\widehat{O}(k^{2})$ max-flow calls, and, hence, in $\widehat{O}(mk^{2})$ time
using the deterministic max-flow algorithm by [Brand et al. FOCS'23]. Our
algorithm gives the first almost-linear-time bound for all $k$ where
$\sqrt{\log n}\le k\le n^{o(1)}$ and subsumes up to a sub polynomial factor the
long-standing state-of-the-art algorithm by [Even'75] which requires
$O(n+k^{2})$ max-flow calls. Our key technique is a deterministic algorithm for
terminal reduction for vertex connectivity: given a terminal set separated by a
vertex mincut, output either a vertex mincut or a smaller terminal set that
remains separated by a vertex mincut. We also show a deterministic
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for vertex connectivity that makes
$O(n/\epsilon^2)$ max-flow calls, improving the bound of $O(n^{1.5})$ max-flow
calls in the exact algorithm of [Gabow, FOCS'00]. The technique is based on
Ramanujan graphs.

<p class="mathjax">While artificial intelligence (AI) has made many successful applications in
various domains, its adoption in healthcare lags a little bit behind other
high-stakes settings. Several factors contribute to this slower uptake,
including regulatory frameworks, patient privacy concerns, and data
heterogeneity. However, one significant challenge that impedes the
implementation of AI in healthcare, particularly in orthopedics, is the lack of
explainability and interpretability around AI models. Addressing the challenge
of explainable AI (XAI) in orthopedics requires developing AI models and
algorithms that prioritize transparency and interpretability, allowing
clinicians, surgeons, and patients to understand the contributing factors
behind any AI-powered predictive or descriptive models. The current
contribution outlines several key challenges and opportunities that manifest in
XAI in orthopedic practice. This work emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary
collaborations between AI practitioners, orthopedic specialists, and regulatory
entities to establish standards and guidelines for the adoption of XAI in
orthopedics.

<p class="mathjax">Corona VIrus Disease abbreviated as COVID-19 is a novel virus which is
initially identified in Wuhan of China in December of 2019 and now this deadly
disease has spread all over the world. According to World Health Organization
(WHO), a total of 3,124,905 people died from 2019 to 2021, April. In this case,
many methods, AI base techniques, and machine learning algorithms have been
researched and are being used to save people from this pandemic. The SARS-CoV
and the 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2 virus invade our bodies, causing some differences
in the structure of cell proteins. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is an
essential process in our cells and plays a very important role in the
development of medicines and gives ideas about the disease. In this study, we
performed clustering on PPI networks generated from 92 genes of the Covi-19
dataset. We have used three graph-based clustering algorithms to give intuition
to the analysis of clusters.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising distributed
machine learning framework to preserve clients' privacy, by allowing multiple
clients to upload the gradients calculated from their local data to a central
server. Recent studies find that the exchanged gradients also take the risk of
privacy leakage, e.g., an attacker can invert the shared gradients and recover
sensitive data against an FL system by leveraging pre-trained generative
adversarial networks (GAN) as prior knowledge. However, performing gradient
inversion attacks in the latent space of the GAN model limits their expression
ability and generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose
\textbf{G}radient \textbf{I}nversion over \textbf{F}eature \textbf{D}omains
(GIFD), which disassembles the GAN model and searches the feature domains of
the intermediate layers. Instead of optimizing only over the initial latent
code, we progressively change the optimized layer, from the initial latent
space to intermediate layers closer to the output images. In addition, we
design a regularizer to avoid unreal image generation by adding a small ${l_1}$
ball constraint to the searching range. We also extend GIFD to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, which weakens the assumption that the
training sets of GANs and FL tasks obey the same data distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve pixel-level reconstruction
and is superior to the existing methods. Notably, GIFD also shows great
generalizability under different defense strategy settings and batch sizes.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of influence maximization (IM) is to select a small set of seed
nodes which maximize the spread of influence on a network. In this work, we
propose BOPIM, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm for IM on temporal
networks. The IM task is well-suited for a BO solution due to its expensive and
complicated objective function. We propose a simple surrogate function to model
the objective function and leverage Gaussian Process regression with shrinkage
priors to fit the model. An acquisition function based on the median of the
posterior distribution leads to a straightforward procedure to select the next
sampling point. In numerical experiments on real-world networks, we find that,
on average, the surrogate function estimates the true influence spread within a
few nodes. Additionally, we show that BOPIM yields comparable influence spreads
to a gold-standard greedy algorithm while being as much as seventeen times
faster. We also use these experiments to demonstrate the proposed method's
ability to quantify uncertainty in optimal seed sets. To the knowledge of the
author, this is the first attempt to look at uncertainty in the seed sets for
IM, as well as the first application of BO to a constrained, combinatorial
optimization problem.

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art multimodal semantic segmentation approaches combining LiDAR
and color data are usually designed on top of asymmetric information-sharing
schemes and assume that both modalities are always available. Regrettably, this
strong assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, where sensors are prone
to failure or can face adverse conditions (night-time, rain, fog, etc.) that
make the acquired information unreliable. Moreover, these architectures tend to
fail in continual learning scenarios. In this work, we re-frame the task of
multimodal semantic segmentation by enforcing a tightly-coupled feature
representation and a symmetric information-sharing scheme, which allows our
approach to work even when one of the input modalities is missing. This makes
our model reliable even in safety-critical settings, as is the case of
autonomous driving. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset,
comparing it with our closest competitor. We also introduce an ad-hoc continual
learning scheme and show results in a class-incremental continual learning
scenario that prove the effectiveness of the approach also in this setting.

<p class="mathjax">Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data
stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data videos have
been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an intuitive
interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the underlying data
insights. However, the production of data videos demands a diverse set of
professional skills and considerable manual labor, including understanding
narratives, linking visual elements with narration segments, designing and
crafting animations, recording audio narrations, and synchronizing audio with
visual animations. To simplify this process, our paper introduces a novel
method, referred to as Data Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic
data videos with narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the
technical barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To
enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references between
visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts data into tables
from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes large language models to
form semantic connections between text and visuals. Finally, Data Player
encodes animation design knowledge as computational low-level constraints,
allowing for the recommendation of suitable animation presets that align with
the audio narration produced by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data
Player's efficacy through an example gallery, a user study, and expert
interviews. The evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate
high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML)-based malware detection systems are becoming
increasingly important as malware threats increase and get more sophisticated.
PDF files are often used as vectors for phishing attacks because they are
widely regarded as trustworthy data resources, and are accessible across
different platforms. Therefore, researchers have developed many different PDF
malware detection methods. Performance in detecting PDF malware is greatly
influenced by feature selection. In this research, we propose a small features
set that don't require too much domain knowledge of the PDF file. We evaluate
proposed features with six different machine learning models. We report the
best accuracy of 99.75% when using Random Forest model. Our proposed feature
set, which consists of just 12 features, is one of the most conciseness in the
field of PDF malware detection. Despite its modest size, we obtain comparable
results to state-of-the-art that employ a much larger set of features.

<p class="mathjax">Multimedia recommendation involves personalized ranking tasks, where
multimedia content is usually represented using a generic encoder. However,
these generic representations introduce spurious correlations that fail to
reveal users' true preferences. Existing works attempt to alleviate this
problem by learning invariant representations, but overlook the balance between
independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. In this paper, we propose a framework called Pareto Invariant
Representation Learning (PaInvRL) to mitigate the impact of spurious
correlations from an IID-OOD multi-objective optimization perspective, by
learning invariant representations (intrinsic factors that attract user
attention) and variant representations (other factors) simultaneously.
Specifically, PaInvRL includes three iteratively executed modules: (i)
heterogeneous identification module, which identifies the heterogeneous
environments to reflect distributional shifts for user-item interactions; (ii)
invariant mask generation module, which learns invariant masks based on the
Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize the adaptive weighted Invariant Risk
Minimization (IRM) and Empirical Risk (ERM) losses; (iii) convert module, which
generates both variant representations and item-invariant representations for
training a multi-modal recommendation model that mitigates spurious
correlations and balances the generalization performance within and cross the
environmental distributions. We compare the proposed PaInvRL with
state-of-the-art recommendation models on three public multimedia
recommendation datasets (Movielens, Tiktok, and Kwai), and the experimental
results validate the effectiveness of PaInvRL for both within- and
cross-environmental learning.

<p class="mathjax">We address the task of probabilistic anomaly attribution in the black-box
regression setting, where the goal is to compute the probability distribution
of the attribution score of each input variable, given an observed anomaly. The
training dataset is assumed to be unavailable. This task differs from the
standard XAI (explainable AI) scenario, since we wish to explain the anomalous
deviation from a black-box prediction rather than the black-box model itself.
<br />We begin by showing that mainstream model-agnostic explanation methods, such
as the Shapley values, are not suitable for this task because of their
``deviation-agnostic property.'' We then propose a novel framework for
probabilistic anomaly attribution that allows us to not only compute
attribution scores as the predictive mean but also quantify the uncertainty of
those scores. This is done by considering a generative process for
perturbations that counter-factually bring the observed anomalous observation
back to normalcy. We introduce a variational Bayes algorithm for deriving the
distributions of per variable attribution scores. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first probabilistic anomaly attribution framework that is free from
being deviation-agnostic.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there have been significant breakthroughs in the field of
natural language processing, particularly with the development of large
language models (LLMs). These LLMs have showcased remarkable capabilities on
various benchmarks. In the healthcare field, the exact role LLMs and other
future AI models will play remains unclear. There is a potential for these
models in the future to be used as part of adaptive physician training, medical
co-pilot applications, and digital patient interaction scenarios. The ability
of AI models to participate in medical training and patient care will depend in
part on their mastery of the knowledge content of specific medical fields. This
study investigated the medical knowledge capability of LLMs, specifically in
the context of internal medicine subspecialty multiple-choice test-taking
ability. We compared the performance of several open-source LLMs (Koala 7B,
Falcon 7B, Stable-Vicuna 13B, and Orca Mini 13B), to GPT-4 and Claude 2 on
multiple-choice questions in the field of Nephrology. Nephrology was chosen as
an example of a particularly conceptually complex subspecialty field within
internal medicine. The study was conducted to evaluate the ability of LLM
models to provide correct answers to nephSAP (Nephrology Self-Assessment
Program) multiple-choice questions. The overall success of open-sourced LLMs in
answering the 858 nephSAP multiple-choice questions correctly was 17.1% -
25.5%. In contrast, Claude 2 answered 54.4% of the questions correctly, whereas
GPT-4 achieved a score of 73.3%. We show that current widely used open-sourced
LLMs do poorly in their ability for zero-shot reasoning when compared to GPT-4
and Claude 2. The findings of this study potentially have significant
implications for the future of subspecialty medical training and patient care.

<p class="mathjax">When provided with sufficient explanatory context, smaller Language Models
have been shown to exhibit strong reasoning ability on challenging short-answer
question-answering tasks where the questions are unseen in training. We
evaluate two methods for further improvement in this setting. Both methods
focus on combining rationales generated by a larger Language Model with longer
contexts created from a multi-hop dense retrieval system. The first method
($\textit{RR}$) involves training a Rationale Ranking model to score both
generated rationales and retrieved contexts with respect to relevance and
truthfulness. We then use the scores to derive combined contexts from both
knowledge sources using a number of combinatory strategies. For the second
method ($\textit{RATD}$) we train a smaller Reasoning model using
retrieval-augmented training datasets such that it becomes proficient at
utilising relevant information from longer text sequences that may be only
partially evidential and frequently contain many irrelevant sentences.
Generally we find that both methods are effective but that the $\textit{RATD}$
method is more straightforward to apply and produces the strongest results in
the unseen setting on which we focus. Our single best Reasoning model using
only 440 million parameters materially improves upon strong comparable prior
baselines for unseen evaluation datasets (StrategyQA 58.9 $\rightarrow$ 61.7
acc., CommonsenseQA 63.6 $\rightarrow$ 72.7 acc., ARC-DA 31.6 $\rightarrow$
52.1 F1, IIRC 25.5 $\rightarrow$ 27.3 F1) and a version utilising our prior
knowledge of each type of question in selecting a context combination strategy
does even better. Our proposed models also generally outperform direct prompts
against much larger models (BLOOM 175B and StableVicuna 13B) in both few-shot
chain-of-thought and few-shot answer-only settings.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advanced methods in Natural Language Understanding for Task-oriented
Dialogue (TOD) Systems (e.g., intent detection and slot filling) require a
large amount of annotated data to achieve competitive performance. In reality,
token-level annotations (slot labels) are time-consuming and difficult to
acquire. In this work, we study the Slot Induction (SI) task whose objective is
to induce slot boundaries without explicit knowledge of token-level slot
annotations. We propose leveraging Unsupervised Pre-trained Language Model
(PLM) Probing and Contrastive Learning mechanism to exploit (1) unsupervised
semantic knowledge extracted from PLM, and (2) additional sentence-level intent
label signals available from TOD. Our approach is shown to be effective in SI
task and capable of bridging the gaps with token-level supervised models on two
NLU benchmark datasets. When generalized to emerging intents, our SI objectives
also provide enhanced slot label representations, leading to improved
performance on the Slot Filling tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Interaction is critical for data analysis and sensemaking. However, designing
interactive physicalizations is challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary
knowledge in visualization, fabrication, and electronics. Interactive
physicalizations are typically produced in an unstructured manner, resulting in
unique solutions for a specific dataset, problem, or interaction that cannot be
easily extended or adapted to new scenarios or future physicalizations. To
mitigate these challenges, we introduce a computational design pipeline to 3D
print network physicalizations with integrated sensing capabilities. Networks
are ubiquitous, yet their complex geometry also requires significant
engineering considerations to provide intuitive, effective interactions for
exploration. Using our pipeline, designers can readily produce network
physicalizations supporting selection-the most critical atomic operation for
interaction-by touch through capacitive sensing and computational inference.
Our computational design pipeline introduces a new design paradigm by
concurrently considering the form and interactivity of a physicalization into
one cohesive fabrication workflow. We evaluate our approach using (i)
computational evaluations, (ii) three usage scenarios focusing on general
visualization tasks, and (iii) expert interviews. The design paradigm
introduced by our pipeline can lower barriers to physicalization research,
creation, and adoption.

<p class="mathjax">Even though the analysis of unsteady 2D flow fields is challenging, fluid
mechanics experts generally have an intuition on where in the simulation domain
specific features are expected. Using this intuition, showing similar regions
enables the user to discover flow patterns within the simulation data. When
focusing on similarity, a solid mathematical framework for a specific flow
pattern is not required. We propose a technique that visualizes similar and
dissimilar regions with respect to a region selected by the user. Using
infinitesimal strain theory, we capture the strain and rotation progression and
therefore the dynamics of fluid parcels along pathlines, which we encode as
distributions. We then apply the Jensen-Shannon divergence to compute the
(dis)similarity between pathline dynamics originating in a user-defined flow
region and the pathline dynamics of the flow field. We validate our method by
applying it to two simulation datasets of two-dimensional unsteady flows. Our
results show that our approach is suitable for analyzing the similarity of
time-dependent flow fields.

<p class="mathjax">Peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets enable prosumers to minimize their
costs, which has been extensively studied in recent research. However, there
are several challenges with P2P trading when physical network constraints are
also included. Moreover, most studies use fixed prices for grid power prices
without considering dynamic grid pricing, and equity for all participants. This
policy may negatively affect the long-term development of the market if
prosumers with low demand are not treated fairly. An initial step towards
addressing these problems is the design of a new decentralized P2P electricity
market with two dynamic grid pricing schemes that are determined by consumer
demand. Futhermore, we consider a decentralized system with physical
constraints for optimizing power flow in networks without compromising privacy.
We propose a dynamic congestion price to effectively address congestion and
then prove the convergence and global optimality of the proposed method. Our
experiments show that P2P energy trade decreases generation cost of main grid
by 56.9% compared with previous works. Consumers reduce grid trading by 57.3%
while the social welfare of consumers is barely affected by the increase of
grid price.

perfect-information games, specifically focusing on Xiangqi, a traditional
Chinese board game comparable in game-tree complexity to chess and shogi. By
analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the influence of the internal geometrical structure
of soft pneu-nets on the dynamic response and hysteresis of the actuators. The
research findings indicate that by strategically manipulating the stress
distribution within soft robots, it is possible to enhance the dynamic response
while reducing hysteresis. The study utilizes the Finite Element Method (FEM)
and includes experimental validation through markerless motion tracking of the
soft robot. In particular, the study examines actuator bending angles up to
500% strain while achieving 95% accuracy in predicting the bending angle. The
results demonstrate that the particular design with the minimum air chamber
width in the center significantly improves both high- and low-frequency
hysteresis behavior by 21.5% while also enhancing dynamic response by 60% to
112% across various frequencies and peak-to-peak pressures. Consequently, the
paper evaluates the effectiveness of "mechanically programming" stress
distribution and distributed energy storage within soft robots to maximize
their dynamic performance, offering direct benefits for control.

<p class="mathjax">By applying artificial intelligence to image editing technology, it has
become possible to generate high-quality images with minimal traces of
manipulation. However, since these technologies can be misused for criminal
activities such as dissemination of false information, destruction of evidence,
and denial of facts, it is crucial to implement strong countermeasures. In this
study, image file and mobile forensic artifacts analysis were conducted for
detecting image manipulation. Image file analysis involves parsing the metadata
of manipulated images (e.g., Exif, DQT, and Filename Signature) and comparing
them with a Reference DB to detect manipulation. The Reference DB is a database
that collects manipulation-related traces left in image metadata, which serves
as a criterion for detecting image manipulation. In the mobile forensic
artifacts analysis, packages related to image editing tools were extracted and
analyzed to aid the detection of image manipulation. The proposed methodology
overcomes the limitations of existing graphic feature-based analysis and
combines with image processing techniques, providing the advantage of reducing
false positives. The research results demonstrate the significant role of such
methodology in digital forensic investigation and analysis. Additionally, We
provide the code for parsing image metadata and the Reference DB along with the
dataset of manipulated images, aiming to contribute to related research.

<p class="mathjax">After completing the design and training phases, deploying a deep learning
model onto specific hardware is essential before practical implementation.
Targeted optimizations are necessary to enhance the model's performance by
reducing inference latency. Auto-scheduling, an automated technique offering
various optimization options, proves to be a viable solution for large-scale
auto-deployment. However, the low-level code generated by auto-scheduling
resembles hardware coding, potentially hindering human comprehension and
impeding manual optimization efforts. In this ongoing study, we aim to develop
an enhanced visualization that effectively addresses the extensive profiling
metrics associated with auto-scheduling. This visualization will illuminate the
intricate scheduling process, enabling further advancements in latency
optimization through insights derived from the schedule.

<p class="mathjax">Invariance against rotations of 3D objects is an important property in
analyzing 3D point set data. Conventional 3D point set DNNs having rotation
invariance typically obtain accurate 3D shape features via supervised learning
by using labeled 3D point sets as training samples. However, due to the rapid
increase in 3D point set data and the high cost of labeling, a framework to
learn rotation-invariant 3D shape features from numerous unlabeled 3D point
sets is required. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning
framework for acquiring accurate and rotation-invariant 3D point set features
at object-level. Our proposed lightweight DNN architecture decomposes an input
3D point set into multiple global-scale regions, called tokens, that preserve
the spatial layout of partial shapes composing the 3D object. We employ a
self-attention mechanism to refine the tokens and aggregate them into an
expressive rotation-invariant feature per 3D point set. Our DNN is effectively
trained by using pseudo-labels generated by a self-distillation framework. To
facilitate the learning of accurate features, we propose to combine multi-crop
and cut-mix data augmentation techniques to diversify 3D point sets for
training. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we empirically demonstrate that,
(1) existing rotation-invariant DNN architectures designed for supervised
learning do not necessarily learn accurate 3D shape features under a
self-supervised learning scenario, and (2) our proposed algorithm learns
rotation-invariant 3D point set features that are more accurate than those
learned by existing algorithms. Code will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Few concepts are as ubiquitous in computational fields as trust. However, in
the case of information visualization, there are several unique and complex
challenges, chief among them: defining and measuring trust. In this paper, we
investigate the factors that influence trust in visualizations. We draw on the
literature to identify five factors likely to affect trust: credibility,
clarity, reliability, familiarity, and confidence. We then conduct two studies
investigating these factors' relationship with visualization design features.
In the first study, participants' credibility, understanding, and reliability
ratings depended on the visualization design and its source. In the second
study, we find these factors also align with subjective trust rankings. Our
findings suggest that these five factors are important considerations for the
design of trustworthy visualizations.

<p class="mathjax">Music generation has attracted growing interest with the advancement of deep
generative models. However, generating music conditioned on textual
descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity
of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements. Despite the task's
significance, prevailing generative models exhibit limitations in music
quality, computational efficiency, and generalization. This paper introduces
JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a
diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive
training. Through in-context learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks
including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation.
Evaluations demonstrate JEN-1's superior performance over state-of-the-art
methods in text-music alignment and music quality while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our demos are available at

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, automobile is facing the trend of electrification. Lithium-ion
batteries is widely used as their power supplies. Lithium-ion battery has
complex characteristics, as a result, Lithium-ion battery needs optimal
charging strategies to make sure it is charged safely and efficiently. This
paper focuses on development of a high-efficient charging method for
lithium-ion battery. To test different charging strategies, the electric
vehicle charging system consisting of a dual active bridge DC-DC converter and
a Thevenin battery model is implemented. Multistage constant current charging
(MSCC) and multistage constant current reflex charging (MSCC with reflex
charging) were proposed. Compared with the traditional constant voltage
constant current (CC-CV) charging method, MSCC can reduce 12% of the charging
time and 1.1% of the battery loss; MSCC with reflex charging has a 10.45% and a
1.54% reduction of charging time and battery loss separately.

<p class="mathjax">Text design is one of the most critical procedures in poster design, as it
relies heavily on the creativity and expertise of humans to design text images
considering the visual harmony and text-semantic. This study introduces
TextPainter, a novel multimodal approach that leverages contextual visual
information and corresponding text semantics to generate text images.
Specifically, TextPainter takes the global-local background image as a hint of
style and guides the text image generation with visual harmony. Furthermore, we
leverage the language model and introduce a text comprehension module to
achieve both sentence-level and word-level style variations. Besides, we
construct the PosterT80K dataset, consisting of about 80K posters annotated
with sentence-level bounding boxes and text contents. We hope this dataset will
pave the way for further research on multimodal text image generation.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that TextPainter
can generatevisually-and-semantically-harmonious text images for posters.

<p class="mathjax">Physics-informed neural networks have been widely applied to partial
differential equations with great success because the physics-informed loss
essentially requires no observations or discretization. However, it is
difficult to optimize model parameters, and these parameters must be trained
for each distinct initial condition. To overcome these challenges in
second-order reaction-diffusion type equations, a possible way is to use
five-point stencil convolutional neural networks (FCNNs). FCNNs are trained
using two consecutive snapshots, where the time step corresponds to the step
size of the given snapshots. Thus, the time evolution of FCNNs depends on the
time step, and the time step must satisfy its CFL condition to avoid blow-up
solutions. In this work, we propose deep FCNNs that have large receptive fields
to predict time evolutions with a time step larger than the threshold of the
CFL condition. To evaluate our models, we consider the heat, Fisher's, and
Allen-Cahn equations with diverse initial conditions. We demonstrate that deep
FCNNs retain certain accuracies, in contrast to FDMs that blow up.

participants and 2 technical reviewers, from a software development department
designed to understand the impact of using LLMs trained for code generation in
specific phases of the team, more specifically, technical onboarding and
technical stack switch. The study uses technical problems dedicated to each
phase and requests solutions from the participants with and without using
AI-Code generators. It measures time, correctness, and technical integration
using ReviewerScore, a metric specific to the paper and extracted from actual
industry standards, the code reviewers of merge requests. The output is
converted and analyzed together with feedback from the participants in an
attempt to determine if using AI-assisted programming tools will have an impact
on getting developers onboard in a project or helping them with a smooth
transition between the two native development environments of mobile
development, Android and iOS. The study was performed between May and June 2023
with members of the mobile department of a software development company based
in Cluj-Napoca, with Romanian ownership and management.

approach based on the error dynamics and the free-time convergence method is
proposed in this paper. Firstly, the desired free-time convergent error
dynamics approach is proposed, and its convergent time can be set freely, which
is independent of the initial states and the guidance parameters. Then, the
illustrative guidance laws considering the leading angle constraint, impact
angle constraint, and impact time constraint are derived based on the proposed

<p class="mathjax">Fuzzing has achieved tremendous success in discovering bugs and
vulnerabilities in various software systems. Systems under test (SUTs) that
take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime
engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are
especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software
development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific
language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other languages or even other
versions of the same language. Moreover, the inputs generated by existing
fuzzers are often limited to specific features of the input language, and thus
can hardly reveal bugs related to other or new features. This paper presents
Fuzz4All, the first fuzzer that is universal in the sense that it can target
many different input languages and many different features of these languages.
The key idea behind Fuzz4All is to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an
input generation and mutation engine, which enables the approach to produce
diverse and realistic inputs for any practically relevant language. To realize
this potential, we present a novel autoprompting technique, which creates LLM
prompts that are wellsuited for fuzzing, and a novel LLM-powered fuzzing loop,
which iteratively updates the prompt to create new fuzzing inputs. We evaluate
Fuzz4All on nine systems under test that take in six different languages (C,
C++, Go, SMT2, Java and Python) as inputs. The evaluation shows, across all six
languages, that universal fuzzing achieves higher coverage than existing,
language-specific fuzzers. Furthermore, Fuzz4All has identified 76 bugs in
widely used systems, such as GCC, Clang, Z3, CVC5, OpenJDK, and the Qiskit
quantum computing platform, with 47 bugs already confirmed by developers as
previously unknown.

<p class="mathjax">Children possess the ability to learn multiple cognitive tasks sequentially,
which is a major challenge toward the long-term goal of artificial general
intelligence. Existing continual learning frameworks are usually applicable to
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and lack the exploration on more brain-inspired,
energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Drawing on continual learning
mechanisms during child growth and development, we propose Dynamic Structure
Development of Spiking Neural Networks (DSD-SNN) for efficient and adaptive
continual learning. When learning a sequence of tasks, the DSD-SNN dynamically
assigns and grows new neurons to new tasks and prunes redundant neurons,
thereby increasing memory capacity and reducing computational overhead. In
addition, the overlapping shared structure helps to quickly leverage all
acquired knowledge to new tasks, empowering a single network capable of
supporting multiple incremental tasks (without the separate sub-network mask
for each task). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on multiple
class incremental learning and task incremental learning benchmarks. Extensive
experiments demonstrated that our model could significantly improve
performance, learning speed and memory capacity, and reduce computational
overhead. Besides, our DSD-SNN model achieves comparable performance with the
DNNs-based methods, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance for existing SNNs-based continual learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate outstanding performance across most
computer vision tasks. Some critical applications, such as autonomous driving
or medical imaging, also require investigation into their behavior and the
reasons behind the decisions they make. In this vein, DNN attribution consists
in studying the relationship between the predictions of a DNN and its inputs.
Attribution methods have been adapted to highlight the most relevant weights or
neurons in a DNN, allowing to more efficiently select which weights or neurons
can be pruned. However, a limitation of these approaches is that weights are
typically compared within each layer separately, while some layers might appear
as more critical than others. In this work, we propose to investigate DNN layer
importance, i.e. to estimate the sensitivity of the accuracy w.r.t.
perturbations applied at the layer level. To do so, we propose a novel dataset
to evaluate our method as well as future works. We benchmark a number of
criteria and draw conclusions regarding how to assess DNN layer importance and,
consequently, how to budgetize layers for increased DNN efficiency (with
applications for DNN pruning and quantization), as well as robustness to
hardware failure (e.g. bit swaps).

<p class="mathjax">Consider a setting where multiple parties holding sensitive data aim to
collaboratively learn population level statistics, but pooling the sensitive
data sets is not possible. We propose a framework in which each party shares a
differentially private synthetic twin of their data. We study the feasibility
of combining such synthetic twin data sets for collaborative learning on
real-world health data from the UK Biobank. We discover that parties engaging
in the collaborative learning via shared synthetic data obtain more accurate
estimates of target statistics compared to using only their local data. This
finding extends to the difficult case of small heterogeneous data sets.
Furthermore, the more parties participate, the larger and more consistent the
improvements become. Finally, we find that data sharing can especially help
parties whose data contain underrepresented groups to perform better-adjusted
analysis for said groups. Based on our results we conclude that sharing of
synthetic twins is a viable method for enabling learning from sensitive data
without violating privacy constraints even if individual data sets are small or
do not represent the overall population well. The setting of distributed
sensitive data is often a bottleneck in biomedical research, which our study
shows can be alleviated with privacy-preserving collaborative learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">Information retrieval (IR) or knowledge retrieval, is a critical component
for many down-stream tasks such as open-domain question answering (QA). It is
also very challenging, as it requires succinctness, completeness, and
correctness. In recent works, dense retrieval models have achieved
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on in-domain IR and QA benchmarks by
representing queries and knowledge passages with dense vectors and learning the
lexical and semantic similarity. However, using single dense vectors and
end-to-end supervision are not always optimal because queries may require
attention to multiple aspects and event implicit knowledge. In this work, we
propose an information retrieval pipeline that uses entity/event linking model
and query decomposition model to focus more accurately on different information
units of the query. We show that, while being more interpretable and reliable,
our proposed pipeline significantly improves passage coverages and denotation
accuracies across five IR and QA benchmarks. It will be the go-to system to use
for applications that need to perform IR on a new domain without much dedicated
effort, because of its superior interpretability and cross-domain performance.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language navigation (VLN), which entails an agent to navigate 3D
environments following human instructions, has shown great advances. However,
current agents are built upon panoramic observations, which hinders their
ability to perceive 3D scene geometry and easily leads to ambiguous selection
of panoramic view. To address these limitations, we present a BEV Scene Graph
(BSG), which leverages multi-step BEV representations to encode scene layouts
and geometric cues of indoor environment under the supervision of 3D detection.
During navigation, BSG builds a local BEV representation at each step and
maintains a BEV-based global scene map, which stores and organizes all the
online collected local BEV representations according to their topological
relations. Based on BSG, the agent predicts a local BEV grid-level decision
score and a global graph-level decision score, combined with a sub-view
selection score on panoramic views, for more accurate action prediction. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on REVERIE, R2R,
and R4R, showing the potential of BEV perception in VLN.

<p class="mathjax">The ethics of automated vehicles (AV) has received a great amount of
attention in recent years, specifically in regard to their decisional policies
in accident situations in which human harm is a likely consequence. After a
discussion about the pertinence and cogency of the term 'artificial moral
agent' to describe AVs that would accomplish these sorts of decisions, and
starting from the assumption that human harm is unavoidable in some situations,
a strategy for AV decision making is proposed using only pre-defined parameters
to characterize the risk of possible accidents and also integrating the Ethical
Valence Theory, which paints AV decision-making as a type of claim mitigation,
into multiple possible decision rules to determine the most suitable action
given the specific environment and decision context. The goal of this approach
is not to define how moral theory requires vehicles to behave, but rather to
provide a computational approach that is flexible enough to accommodate a
number of human 'moral positions' concerning what morality demands and what
road users may expect, offering an evaluation tool for the social acceptability
of an automated vehicle's decision making.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm that
trains neural networks on edge devices without collecting data at a central
server. However, FL encounters an inherent challenge in dealing with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among devices. To
address this challenge, this paper proposes a hard feature matching data
synthesis (HFMDS) method to share auxiliary data besides local models.
Specifically, synthetic data are generated by learning the essential
class-relevant features of real samples and discarding the redundant features,
which helps to effectively tackle the non-IID issue. For better privacy
preservation, we propose a hard feature augmentation method to transfer real
features towards the decision boundary, with which the synthetic data not only
improve the model generalization but also erase the information of real
features. By integrating the proposed HFMDS method with FL, we present a novel
FL framework with data augmentation to relieve data heterogeneity. The
theoretical analysis highlights the effectiveness of our proposed data
synthesis method in solving the non-IID challenge. Simulation results further
demonstrate that our proposed HFMDS-FL algorithm outperforms the baselines in
terms of accuracy, privacy preservation, and computational cost on various
benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">In decentralized federated learning (DFL), substantial traffic from frequent
inter-node communication and non-independent and identically distributed
(non-IID) data challenges high-accuracy model acquisition. We propose Tram-FL,
a novel DFL method, which progressively refines a global model by transferring
it sequentially amongst nodes, rather than by exchanging and aggregating local
models. We also introduce a dynamic model routing algorithm for optimal route
selection, aimed at enhancing model precision with minimal forwarding. Our
experiments using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDb datasets demonstrate that Tram-FL
with the proposed routing delivers high model accuracy under non-IID
conditions, outperforming baselines while reducing communication costs.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Speech and language pathologists (SLPs) often relyon judgements
of speech fluency for diagnosing or monitoringpatients with aphasia. However,
such subjective methods havebeen criticised for their lack of reliability and
their clinical cost interms of time. Aims: This study aims at assessing the
relevance of a signalprocessingalgorithm, initially developed in the field of
language acquisition, for the automatic measurement of speech fluency in people
with aphasia (PWA). Methods &amp; Procedures: Twenty-nine PWA and five control
participantswere recruited via non-profit organizations and SLP networks. All
participants were recorded while reading out loud a set ofsentences taken from
the French version of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. Three trained
SLPs assessed the fluency of each sentence on a five-point qualitative scale. A
forward-backward divergence segmentation and a clustering algorithm were used
to compute, for each sentence, four automatic predictors of speech fluency:
pseudo-syllable rate, speech ratio, rate of silent breaks, and standard
deviation of pseudo-syllable length. The four predictors were finally combined
into multivariate regression models (a multiplelinear regression - MLR, and two
non-linear models) to predict the average SLP ratings of speech fluency, using
a leave-one speaker-out validation scheme. Outcomes &amp; Results: All models
achieved accurate predictions of speech fluency ratings, with average
root-mean-square errors as low as 0.5. The MLR yielded a correlation
coefficient of 0.87 with reference ratings at the sentence level, and of 0.93
when aggregating the data for each participant. The inclusion of an additional
predictor sensitive to repetitions improved further the predictions with a
correlation coefficient of 0.91 at the sentence level, and of 0.96 at the
participant level. Conclusions: The algorithms used in this study can
constitute a cost-effective and reliable tool for the assessment of the speech
fluency of patients with aphasia in read-aloud tasks. Perspectives for the
assessment of spontaneous speech are discussed.

as valuable features for attribute classification, such as age, race, and
gender. Additionally, facial skin images offer the advantages of easy
collection and minimal privacy concerns. However, the availability of
well-labeled human skin datasets with a sufficient number of images is limited.
To address this issue, we introduce a dataset called FaceSkin, which
encompasses a diverse range of ages and races. Furthermore, to broaden the
application scenarios, we incorporate synthetic skin-patches obtained from 2D
and 3D attack images, including printed paper, replays, and 3D masks. We
evaluate the FaceSkin dataset across distinct categories and present
experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness in attribute
classification, as well as its potential for various downstream tasks, such as
Face anti-spoofing and Age estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised sound source localization is usually challenged by the
modality inconsistency. In recent studies, contrastive learning based
strategies have shown promising to establish such a consistent correspondence
between audio and sound sources in visual scenarios. Unfortunately, the
insufficient attention to the heterogeneity influence in the different modality
features still limits this scheme to be further improved, which also becomes
the motivation of our work. In this study, an Induction Network is proposed to
bridge the modality gap more effectively. By decoupling the gradients of visual
and audio modalities, the discriminative visual representations of sound
sources can be learned with the designed Induction Vector in a bootstrap
manner, which also enables the audio modality to be aligned with the visual
modality consistently. In addition to a visual weighted contrastive loss, an
adaptive threshold selection strategy is introduced to enhance the robustness
of the Induction Network. Substantial experiments conducted on SoundNet-Flickr
and VGG-Sound Source datasets have demonstrated a superior performance compared
to other state-of-the-art works in different challenging scenarios. The code is

<p class="mathjax">Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is an essential task for large-scale
e-commerce platforms. However, refund behaviors frequently occur after
conversion in online shopping systems, which drives us to pay attention to
effective conversion for building healthier shopping services. This paper
defines the probability of item purchasing without any subsequent refund as an
effective conversion rate (ECVR). A simple paradigm for ECVR prediction is to
decompose it into two sub-tasks: CVR prediction and post-conversion refund rate
(RFR) prediction. However, RFR prediction suffers from data sparsity (DS) and
sample selection bias (SSB) issues, as the refund behaviors are only available
after user purchase. Furthermore, there is delayed feedback in both conversion
and refund events and they are sequentially dependent, named cascade delayed
feedback (CDF), which significantly harms data freshness for model training.
Previous studies mainly focus on tackling DS and SSB or delayed feedback for a
single event. To jointly tackle these issues in ECVR prediction, we propose an
Entire space CAscade Delayed feedback modeling (ECAD) method. Specifically,
ECAD deals with DS and SSB by constructing two tasks including CVR prediction
and conversion \&amp; refund rate (CVRFR) prediction using the entire space
modeling framework. In addition, it carefully schedules auxiliary tasks to
leverage both conversion and refund time within data to alleviate CDF.
Experimental results on the offline industrial dataset and online A/B testing
demonstrate the effectiveness of ECAD. In addition, ECAD has been deployed in
one of the recommender systems in Alibaba, contributing to a significant
improvement of ECVR.

<p class="mathjax">Correlation-diversified portfolios can be constructed by finding the maximum
independent sets (MISs) in market graphs with edges corresponding to
correlations between two stocks. The computational complexity to find the MIS
increases exponentially as the size of the market graph increases, making the
MIS selection in a large-scale market graph difficult. Here we construct a
diversified portfolio by solving the MIS problem for a large-scale market graph
with a combinatorial optimization solver (an Ising machine) based on a
quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB) and investigate
the investment performance of the constructed portfolio using long-term
historical market data. Comparisons using stock universes of various sizes
[TOPIX 100, Nikkei 225, TOPIX 1000, and TOPIX (including approximately 2,000
constituents)] show that the SB-based solver outperforms conventional MIS
solvers in terms of computation-time and solution-accuracy. By using the
SB-based solver, we optimized the parameters of a MIS portfolio strategy
through iteration of the backcast simulation that calculates the performance of
the MIS portfolio strategy based on a large-scale universe covering more than
1,700 Japanese stocks for a long period of 10 years. It has been found that the
best MIS portfolio strategy (Sharpe ratio = 1.16, annualized return/risk =
16.3%/14.0%) outperforms the major indices such as TOPIX (0.66, 10.0%/15.2%)
and MSCI Japan Minimum Volatility Index (0.64, 7.7%/12.1%) for the period from
2013 to 2023.

<p class="mathjax">Objects in videos are typically characterized by continuous smooth motion. We
exploit continuous smooth motion in three ways. 1) Improved accuracy by using
object motion as an additional source of supervision, which we obtain by
anticipating object locations from a static keyframe. 2) Improved efficiency by
only doing the expensive feature computations on a small subset of all frames.
Because neighboring video frames are often redundant, we only compute features
for a single static keyframe and predict object locations in subsequent frames.
3) Reduced annotation cost, where we only annotate the keyframe and use smooth
pseudo-motion between keyframes. We demonstrate computational efficiency,
annotation efficiency, and improved mean average precision compared to the
state-of-the-art on four datasets: ImageNet VID, EPIC KITCHENS-55,
YouTube-BoundingBoxes, and Waymo Open dataset. Our source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a new sparse unmixing technique using archetypal
analysis (SUnAA). First, we design a new model based on archetypal analysis. We
assume that the endmembers of interest are a convex combination of endmembers
provided by a spectral library and that the number of endmembers of interest is
known. Then, we propose a minimization problem. Unlike most conventional sparse
unmixing methods, here the minimization problem is non-convex. We minimize the
optimization objective iteratively using an active set algorithm. Our method is
robust to the initialization and only requires the number of endmembers of
interest. SUnAA is evaluated using two simulated datasets for which results
confirm its better performance over other conventional and advanced techniques
in terms of signal-to-reconstruction error. SUnAA is also applied to Cuprite
dataset and the results are compared visually with the available geological map
provided for this dataset. The qualitative assessment demonstrates the
successful estimation of the minerals abundances and significantly improves the
detection of dominant minerals compared to the conventional regression-based
sparse unmixing methods. The Python implementation of SUnAA can be found at:

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the advances in deep learning techniques, the application of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based object detection has proliferated across a
range of fields, including vehicle counting, fire detection, and city
monitoring. While most existing research studies only a subset of the
challenges inherent to UAV-based object detection, there are few studies that
balance various aspects to design a practical system for energy consumption
reduction. In response, we present the E3-UAV, an edge-based energy-efficient
object detection system for UAVs. The system is designed to dynamically support
various UAV devices, edge devices, and detection algorithms, with the aim of
minimizing energy consumption by deciding the most energy-efficient flight
parameters (including flight altitude, flight speed, detection algorithm, and
sampling rate) required to fulfill the detection requirements of the task. We
first present an effective evaluation metric for actual tasks and construct a
transparent energy consumption model based on hundreds of actual flight data to
formalize the relationship between energy consumption and flight parameters.
Then we present a lightweight energy-efficient priority decision algorithm
based on a large quantity of actual flight data to assist the system in
deciding flight parameters. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the system,
and our experimental results demonstrate that it can significantly decrease
energy consumption in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we provide four
insights that can assist researchers and engineers in their efforts to study
UAV-based object detection further.

<p class="mathjax">By combining related objects, unsupervised machine learning techniques aim to
reveal the underlying patterns in a data set. Non-negative Matrix Factorization
(NMF) is a data mining technique that splits data matrices by imposing
restrictions on the elements' non-negativity into two matrices: one
representing the data partitions and the other to represent the cluster
prototypes of the data set. This method has attracted a lot of attention and is
used in a wide range of applications, including text mining, clustering,
language modeling, music transcription, and neuroscience (gene separation). The
interpretation of the generated matrices is made simpler by the absence of
negative values. In this article, we propose a study on multi-modal clustering
algorithms and present a novel method called multi-modal multi-view
non-negative matrix factorization, in which we analyze the collaboration of
several local NMF models. The experimental results show the value of the
proposed approach, which was evaluated using a variety of data sets, and the
obtained results are very promising compared to state of art methods.

<p class="mathjax">The application of 3D ground-penetrating radar (3D-GPR) for subgrade distress
detection has gained widespread popularity. To enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of detection, pioneering studies have attempted to adopt automatic
detection techniques, particularly deep learning. However, existing works
typically rely on traditional 1D A-scan, 2D B-scan or 3D C-scan data of the
GPR, resulting in either insufficient spatial information or high computational
complexity. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel methodology for
the subgrade distress detection task by leveraging the multi-view information
from 3D-GPR data. Moreover, we construct a real multi-view image dataset
derived from the original 3D-GPR data for the detection task, which provides
richer spatial information compared to A-scan and B-scan data, while reducing
computational complexity compared to C-scan data. Subsequently, we develop a
novel \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{V}usion and \textbf{D}istillation
framework, \textbf{GPR-MVFD}, specifically designed to optimally utilize the
multi-view GPR dataset. This framework ingeniously incorporates multi-view
distillation and attention-based fusion to facilitate significant feature
extraction for subgrade distresses. In addition, a self-adaptive learning
mechanism is adopted to stabilize the model training and prevent performance
degeneration in each branch. Extensive experiments conducted on this new GPR
benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
framework. Our framework outperforms not only the existing GPR baselines, but
also the state-of-the-art methods in the fields of multi-view learning,
multi-modal learning, and knowledge distillation. We will release the
constructed multi-view GPR dataset with expert-annotated labels and the source
codes of the proposed framework.

<br />In this position paper, we show that this approach is insufficient. While
appending data to blockchain can guarantee non-repudiation of origin in some
cases, it is not sufficient for non-repudiation of receipt. For confidential

<p class="mathjax">Point cloud registration is a task to estimate the rigid transformation
between two unaligned scans, which plays an important role in many computer
vision applications. Previous learning-based works commonly focus on supervised
registration, which have limitations in practice. Recently, with the advance of
inexpensive RGB-D sensors, several learning-based works utilize RGB-D data to
achieve unsupervised registration. However, most of existing unsupervised
methods follow a cascaded design or fuse RGB-D data in a unidirectional manner,
which do not fully exploit the complementary information in the RGB-D data. To
leverage the complementary information more effectively, we propose a network
implementing multi-scale bidirectional fusion between RGB images and point
clouds generated from depth images. By bidirectionally fusing visual and
geometric features in multi-scales, more distinctive deep features for
correspondence estimation can be obtained, making our registration more
accurate. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and 3DMatch demonstrate that our
method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released at

<p class="mathjax">Rust is an emerging, strongly-typed programming language focusing on
efficiency and memory safety. With increasing projects adopting Rust, knowing
how to use Unsafe Rust is crucial for Rust security. We observed that the
description of safety requirements needs to be unified in Unsafe Rust
programming. Current unsafe API documents in the standard library exhibited
variations, including inconsistency and insufficiency. To enhance Rust
security, we suggest unsafe API documents to list systematic descriptions of
safety requirements for users to follow. In this paper, we conducted the first
comprehensive empirical study on safety requirements across unsafe boundaries.
We studied unsafe API documents in the standard library and defined 19 safety
properties (SP). We then completed the data labeling on 416 unsafe APIs while
analyzing their correlation to find interpretable results. To validate the
practical usability and SP coverage, we categorized existing Rust CVEs until
2023-07-08 and performed a statistical analysis of std unsafe API usage toward
the crates.io ecosystem. In addition, we conducted a user survey to gain
insights into four aspects from experienced Rust programmers. We finally
received 50 valid responses and confirmed our classification with statistical
significance.

<p class="mathjax">Rust is an effective system programming language that guarantees memory
safety via compile-time verifications. It employs a novel ownership-based
resource management model to facilitate automated resource deallocation. It is
anticipated that this model will eliminate memory leaks. However, we observed
that user intervention driving semi-automated management is prone to
introducing leaks. In contrast to violating memory-safety guarantees via the
unsafe keyword, the leak breached boundary is implicit with no compiler
alerting. In this paper, we present rCanary, a static, non-intrusive, and fully
automated model checker to detect leaks across the semi-automated boundary. It
adopts a precise encoder to abstract data with heap allocation and formalizes a
refined leak-free memory model based on Boolean satisfiability. rCanary is
implemented as an external component of Cargo and can generate constraints via
MIR data flow. We evaluate it using flawed package benchmarks collected from
the pull requests of prominent Rust packages. The results indicate it is
possible to recall all these defects with acceptable false positives. We also
apply our tool to more than 1,200 real-world crates from crates.io and GitHub,
identifying 19 crates with potentially vulnerable leaks in 8.4 seconds per
package.

<p class="mathjax">We conduct the first empirical study on using knowledge transfer to improve
the generalization ability of large language models (LLMs) in software
engineering tasks, which often require LLMs to generalize beyond their training
data. Our proposed general knowledge transfer approach guides the LLM towards a
similar and familiar API or code snippet it has encountered before, improving
the model's generalization ability for unseen knowledge. We apply this approach
to three software engineering tasks: API inference, code example generation,
and FQN inference, and find transfer span, transfer strategy, and transfer
architecture as key factors affecting the method. Our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of knowledge transfer and its potential to enhance LLMs'
performance in various software engineering tasks. The effectiveness of
knowledge transfer varies depending on the target domain and task, with the
hierarchical strategy being more effective than direct transfer, and AI-Chain
outperforming CoT in prompt design. The implications of these findings extend
beyond software engineering tasks and suggest that knowledge transfer can
enhance LLMs' ability to handle unknowns in any natural language task.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention due to its broad range of
applications, particularly in industrial defect detection. To address the
challenges of data collection, researchers have introduced zero-/few-shot
anomaly detection techniques that require minimal normal images for each
category. However, complex industrial scenarios often involve multiple objects,
presenting a significant challenge. In light of this, we propose a
straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for
zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to
capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank
focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object. The efficacy of our
method is validated by its remarkable achievement of 4th place in the zero-shot
track and 2nd place in the few-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty
Detection (VAND) competition.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Transformer-based models have shown remarkable performance in
long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks due to their ability to model
long-term dependencies. However, the validity of Transformers for LTSF tasks
remains debatable, particularly since recent work has shown that simple linear
models can outperform numerous Transformer-based approaches. This suggests that
there are limitations to the application of Transformer in LTSF. Therefore,
this paper investigates three key issues when applying Transformer to LTSF:
temporal continuity, information density, and multi-channel relationships.
Accordingly, we propose three innovative solutions, including Placeholder
Enhancement Technique (PET), Long Sub-sequence Division (LSD), and
Multi-channel Separation and Interaction (MSI), which together form a novel
model called PETformer. These three key designs introduce prior biases suitable
for LTSF tasks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that PETformer achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on eight commonly used public datasets for
LTSF, outperforming all other models currently available. This demonstrates
that Transformer still possesses powerful capabilities in LTSF.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent autonomous path planning is crucial to improve the exploration
efficiency of planetary rovers. In this paper, we propose a learning-based
method to quickly search for optimal paths in an elevation map, which is called
NNPP. The NNPP model learns semantic information about start and goal
locations, as well as map representations, from numerous pre-annotated optimal
path demonstrations, and produces a probabilistic distribution over each pixel
representing the likelihood of it belonging to an optimal path on the map. More
specifically, the paper computes the traversal cost for each grid cell from the
slope, roughness and elevation difference obtained from the DEM. Subsequently,
the start and goal locations are encoded using a Gaussian distribution and
different location encoding parameters are analyzed for their effect on model
performance. After training, the NNPP model is able to perform path planning on
novel maps. Experiments show that the guidance field generated by the NNPP
model can significantly reduce the search time for optimal paths under the same
hardware conditions, and the advantage of NNPP increases with the scale of the
map.

<p class="mathjax">The usage of drones and rovers helps to overcome the limitations of
traditional agriculture which has been predominantly human-intensive, for
carrying out tasks such as removal of weeds and spraying of fertilizers and
pesticides. Drones and rovers are helping to realize precision agriculture and
farmers with improved monitoring and surveying at affordable costs. Major
benefits have come for vertical farming and fields with irrigation canals.
However, drones have a limitation of flight time due to payload constraints.
Rovers have limitations in vertical farming and obstacles like canals in
agricultural fields. To meet the different requirements of multiple terrains

<p class="mathjax">A graph $G$ contains a graph $H$ as an induced minor if $H$ can be obtained
from $G$ by vertex deletions and edge contractions. The class of
$H$-induced-minor-free graphs generalizes the class of $H$-minor-free graphs,
but unlike $H$-minor-free graphs, it can contain dense graphs. We show that if
an $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph $G$ does not contain a graph $H$ as an induced
minor, then it has a balanced vertex separator of size $O_{H}(\sqrt{m})$, where
the $O_{H}(\cdot)$-notation hides factors depending on $H$. More precisely, our
upper bound for the size of the balanced separator is $O(\min(|V(H)|^2, \log n)
\cdot \sqrt{|V(H)|+|E(H)|} \cdot \sqrt{m})$. We give an algorithm for finding
either an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$ or such a separator in randomized
polynomial-time. We apply this to obtain subexponential $2^{O_{H}(n^{2/3} \log
n)}$ time algorithms on $H$-induced-minor-free graphs for a large class of
problems including maximum independent set, minimum feedback vertex set,
3-coloring, and planarization.
<br />For graphs $H$ where every edge is incident to a vertex of degree at most 2,
our results imply a $2^{O_{H}(n^{2/3} \log n)}$ time algorithm for testing if
$G$ contains $H$ as an induced minor. Our second main result is that there
exists a fixed tree $T$, so that there is no $2^{o(n/\log^3 n)}$ time algorithm
for testing if a given $n$-vertex graph contains $T$ as an induced minor unless
the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Our reduction also gives
NP-hardness, which solves an open problem asked by Fellows, Kratochv\'il,
Middendorf, and Pfeiffer [Algorithmica, 1995], who asked if there exists a
fixed planar graph $H$ so that testing for $H$ as an induced minor is NP-hard.

neuroscience, imaging, streaming data and finance. Machine learning strategies
for spike trains are based on various neural network and probabilistic models.
The probabilistic approach is relying on parametric or nonparametric
specifications of the underlying spike generation model. In this paper we
consider the two-class statistical classification problem for a class of spike
train data characterized by nonparametrically specified intensity functions. We
derive the optimal Bayes rule and next form the plug-in nonparametric kernel
classifier. Asymptotical properties of the rules are established including the
limit with respect to the increasing recording time interval and the size of a
training set. In particular the convergence of the kernel classifier to the
Bayes rule is proved. The obtained results are supported by a finite sample
simulation studies.

<p class="mathjax">Network connectivity is one of the major design issues in the context of
mobile sensor networks. Due to diverse communication patterns, some nodes lying
in high-traffic zones may consume more energy and eventually die out resulting
in network partitioning. This phenomenon may deprive a large number of alive
nodes of sending their important time critical data to the sink. The
application of data caching in mobile sensor networks is exponentially
increasing as a high-speed data storage layer. This paper presents a deep
learning-based beamforming approach to find the optimal transmission strategies
for cache-enabled backhaul networks. In the proposed scheme, the sensor nodes
in isolated partitions work together to form a directional beam which
significantly increases their overall communication range to reach out a
distant relay node connected to the main part of the network. The proposed
methodology of cooperative beamforming-based partition connectivity works
efficiently if an isolated cluster gets partitioned with a favorably large
number of nodes. We also present a new cross-layer method for link cost that
makes a balance between the energy used by the relay. By directly adding the
accessible auxiliary nodes to the set of routing links, the algorithm chooses
paths which provide maximum dynamic beamforming usage for the intermediate
nodes. The proposed approach is then evaluated through simulation results. The
simulation results show that the proposed mechanism achieves up to 30% energy
consumption reduction through beamforming as partition healing in addition to
guarantee user throughput.

control and mobile payments due to its convenience and high accuracy. The
security of facial recognition is also highly regarded. The Face anti-spoofing
system(FAS) for face recognition is an important component used to enhance the
security of face recognition systems. Traditional FAS used images containing
identity information to detect spoofing traces, however there is a risk of
privacy leakage during the transmission and storage of these images. Besides,
the encryption and decryption of these privacy-sensitive data takes too long
compared to inference time by FAS model. To address the above issues, we
propose a face anti-spoofing algorithm based on facial skin patches leveraging
pure facial skin patch images as input, which contain no privacy information,
no encryption or decryption is needed for these images. We conduct experiments
on several public datasets, the results prove that our algorithm has

<p class="mathjax">With the introduction of deep learning models, semantic parsingbased
knowledge base question answering (KBQA) systems have achieved high performance
in handling complex questions. However, most existing approaches primarily
focus on enhancing the model's effectiveness on individual benchmark datasets,
disregarding the high costs of adapting the system to disparate datasets in
real-world scenarios (e.g., multi-tenant platform). Therefore, we present
ADMUS, a progressive knowledge base question answering framework designed to
accommodate a wide variety of datasets, including multiple languages, diverse
backbone knowledge bases, and disparate question answering datasets. To
accomplish the purpose, we decouple the architecture of conventional KBQA
systems and propose this dataset-independent framework. Our framework supports
the seamless integration of new datasets with minimal effort, only requiring
creating a dataset-related micro-service at a negligible cost. To enhance the
usability of ADUMS, we design a progressive framework consisting of three
stages, ranges from executing exact queries, generating approximate queries and
retrieving open-domain knowledge referring from large language models. An

<p class="mathjax">Existing Unbiased Scene Graph Generation (USGG) methods only focus on
addressing the predicate-level imbalance that high-frequency classes dominate
predictions of rare ones, while overlooking the concept-level imbalance.
Actually, even if predicates themselves are balanced, there is still a
significant concept-imbalance within them due to the long-tailed distribution
of contexts (i.e., subject-object combinations). This concept-level imbalance
poses a more pervasive and challenging issue compared to the predicate-level
imbalance since subject-object pairs are inherently complex in combinations.
Hence, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized Unbiased Scene Graph
Generation (G-USGG), which takes into account both predicate-level and
concept-level imbalance. To the end, we propose the Multi-Concept Learning
(MCL) framework, which ensures a balanced learning process across rare/
uncommon/ common concepts. MCL first quantifies the concept-level imbalance
across predicates in terms of different amounts of concepts, representing as
multiple concept-prototypes within the same class. It then effectively learns
concept-prototypes by applying the Concept Regularization (CR) technique.
Furthermore, to achieve balanced learning over different concepts, we introduce
the Balanced Prototypical Memory (BPM), which guides SGG models to generate
balanced representations for concept-prototypes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of our model-agnostic strategy in enhancing
the performance of benchmark models on both VG-SGG and OI-SGG datasets, leading
to new state-of-the-art achievements in two key aspects: predicate-level
unbiased relation recognition and concept-level compositional generability.

<p class="mathjax">Channel state information (CSI) is crucial for achieving ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC) in wireless networks. The main associated
problems are the CSI acquisition time, which impacts the delay requirements of
time-critical applications, and the estimation accuracy, which degrades the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), thus, reducing reliability. In
this work, we formulate and solve a minimum-power precoding design problem
simultaneously serving multiple URLLC users in the downlink with imperfect CSI
availability. Specifically, we develop an algorithm that exploits
state-of-the-art precoding schemes such as the maximal ratio transmission (MRT)
and zero-forcing (ZF), and adjust the power of the precoders to compensate for
the channel estimation error uncertainty based on the extreme value theory
(EVT) framework. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our method and show
its superiority concerning worst-case robust precoding, which is used as a

<p class="mathjax">Towards sufficient music searching, it is vital to form a complete set of
labels for each song. However, current solutions fail to resolve it as they
cannot produce diverse enough mappings to make up for the information missed by
the gold labels. Based on the observation that such missing information may
already be presented in user comments, we propose to study the automated music
labeling in an essential but under-explored setting, where the model is
required to harvest more diverse and valid labels from the users' comments
given limited gold labels. To this end, we design an iterative framework (DiVa)
to harvest more $\underline{\text{Di}}$verse and $\underline{\text{Va}}$lid
labels from user comments for music. The framework makes a classifier able to
form complete sets of labels for songs via pseudo-labels inferred from
pre-trained classifiers and a novel joint score function. The experiment on a
densely annotated testing set reveals the superiority of the Diva over
state-of-the-art solutions in producing more diverse labels missed by the gold
labels. We hope our work can inspire future research on automated music
labeling.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-behavior recommendation algorithms aim to leverage the multiplex
interactions between users and items to learn users' latent preferences. Recent
multi-behavior recommendation frameworks contain two steps: fusion and
prediction. In the fusion step, advanced neural networks are used to model the
hierarchical correlations between user behaviors. In the prediction step,
multiple signals are utilized to jointly optimize the model with a multi-task
learning (MTL) paradigm. However, recent approaches have not addressed the
issue caused by imbalanced data distribution in the fusion step, resulting in
the learned relationships being dominated by high-frequency behaviors. In the
prediction step, the existing methods use a gate mechanism to directly
aggregate expert information generated by coupling input, leading to negative
information transfer. To tackle these issues, we propose a Parallel Knowledge
Enhancement Framework (PKEF) for multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically,
we enhance the hierarchical information propagation in the fusion step using
parallel knowledge (PKF). Meanwhile, in the prediction step, we decouple the
representations to generate expert information and introduce a projection
mechanism during aggregation to eliminate gradient conflicts and alleviate
negative transfer (PME). We conduct comprehensive experiments on three
real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our model. The results
further demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the designed PKF and
PME modules. The source code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/MC-CV/PKEF.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-person motion prediction is a challenging problem due to the dependency
of motion on both individual past movements and interactions with other people.
Transformer-based methods have shown promising results on this task, but they
miss the explicit relation representation between joints, such as skeleton
structure and pairwise distance, which is crucial for accurate interaction
modeling. In this paper, we propose the Joint-Relation Transformer, which
utilizes relation information to enhance interaction modeling and improve
future motion prediction. Our relation information contains the relative
distance and the intra-/inter-person physical constraints. To fuse relation and
joint information, we design a novel joint-relation fusion layer with
relation-aware attention to update both features. Additionally, we supervise
the relation information by forecasting future distance. Experiments show that
our method achieves a 13.4% improvement of 900ms VIM on 3DPW-SoMoF/RC and
17.8%/12.0% improvement of 3s MPJPE on CMU-Mpcap/MuPoTS-3D dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The context-aware emotional reasoning ability of AI systems, especially in
conversations, is of vital importance in applications such as online opinion
mining from social media and empathetic dialogue systems. Due to the implicit
nature of conveying emotions in many scenarios, commonsense knowledge is widely
utilized to enrich utterance semantics and enhance conversation modeling.
However, most previous knowledge infusion methods perform empirical knowledge
filtering and design highly customized architectures for knowledge interaction
with the utterances, which can discard useful knowledge aspects and limit their
generalizability to different knowledge sources. Based on these observations,
we propose a Bipartite Heterogeneous Graph (BHG) method for enhancing emotional
reasoning with commonsense knowledge. In BHG, the extracted context-aware
utterance representations and knowledge representations are modeled as
heterogeneous nodes. Two more knowledge aggregation node types are proposed to
perform automatic knowledge filtering and interaction. BHG-based knowledge
infusion can be directly generalized to multi-type and multi-grained knowledge
sources. In addition, we propose a Multi-dimensional Heterogeneous Graph
Transformer (MHGT) to perform graph reasoning, which can retain unchanged
feature spaces and unequal dimensions for heterogeneous node types during
inference to prevent unnecessary loss of information. Experiments show that
BHG-based methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art knowledge infusion
methods and show generalized knowledge infusion ability with higher efficiency.
Further analysis proves that previous empirical knowledge filtering methods do
not guarantee to provide the most useful knowledge information. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/SteveKGYang/BHG.

<p class="mathjax">With the continuous emergence of Chinese Large Language Models (LLMs), how to
evaluate a model's capabilities has become an increasingly significant issue.
The absence of a comprehensive Chinese benchmark that thoroughly assesses a
model's performance, the unstandardized and incomparable prompting procedure,
and the prevalent risk of contamination pose major challenges in the current
evaluation of Chinese LLMs. We present CLEVA, a user-friendly platform crafted
to holistically evaluate Chinese LLMs. Our platform employs a standardized
workflow to assess LLMs' performance across various dimensions, regularly
updating a competitive leaderboard. To alleviate contamination, CLEVA curates a
significant proportion of new data and develops a sampling strategy that
guarantees a unique subset for each leaderboard round. Empowered by an
easy-to-use interface that requires just a few mouse clicks and a model API,
users can conduct a thorough evaluation with minimal coding. Large-scale
experiments featuring 23 influential Chinese LLMs have validated CLEVA's
efficacy.

<p class="mathjax">Ontologies are used in various domains, with RDF and OWL being prominent
standards for ontology development. RDF is favored for its simplicity and
flexibility, while OWL enables detailed domain knowledge representation.
However, as ontologies grow larger and more expressive, reasoning complexity
increases, and traditional reasoners struggle to perform efficiently. Despite
optimization efforts, scalability remains an issue. Additionally, advancements
in automated knowledge base construction have created large and expressive
ontologies that are often noisy and inconsistent, posing further challenges for
conventional reasoners. To address these challenges, researchers have explored
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine neural networks' learning capabilities
with symbolic systems' reasoning abilities. In this chapter,we provide an
overview of the existing literature in the field of neuro-symbolic deductive
reasoning supported by RDF(S), the description logics EL and ALC, and OWL 2 RL,
discussing the techniques employed, the tasks they address, and other relevant
efforts in this area.

<p class="mathjax">Scientific optical 3D modeling requires the possibility to implement highly
flexible and customizable mathematical models as well as high computing power.
However, established ray tracing software for optical design and modeling
purposes often has limitations in terms of access to underlying mathematical
models and the possibility of accelerating the mostly CPU-based computation. To
address these limitations, we propose the use of NVIDIA's OptiX Ray Tracing
Engine as a highly flexible and high-performing alternative. OptiX offers a
highly customizable ray tracing framework with onboard GPU support for parallel
computing, as well as access to optimized ray tracing algorithms for
accelerated computation. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, a
realistic focus variation instrument is modeled, describing optical instrument
components (light sources, lenses, detector, etc.) as well as the measuring
sample surface mathematically or as meshed files. Using this focus variation
instrument model, exemplary virtual measurements of arbitrary and standardized
sample surfaces are carried out, generating image stacks of more than 100
images and tracing more than 1E9 light rays per image. The performance and
accuracy of the simulations are qualitatively evaluated, and virtually
generated detector images are compared with images acquired by a respective
physical measuring device.

<p class="mathjax">Small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) attract much attention from both
industry and academia. The latest production and launch technologies constantly
drive the development of LEO constellations. However, the wideband signal,
except text messages, cannot be transmitted directly from an LEO satellite to a
standard mobile cellular phone due to the insufficient link budget. The current
LEO constellation network has to use an extra ground device to receive the
signal from the satellite first and then forward the signal to the User
Equipment (UE). To achieve direct network communications between LEO satellites
and UE, we propose a novel distributed beamforming technology based on the
superposition of electromagnetic (EM) waves radiated from multiple satellites
that can significantly enhance the link budget in this paper. EM full-wave
simulation and Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results show a nearly 6 dB
enhancement using two radiation sources and an almost 12 dB enhancement using
four sources. The received power enhancement could be doubled compared to the
diversity gain in Multiple-Input and Single-Output (MISO). Furthermore, other
practical application challenges, such as the synchronization and Doppler
effect, are also presented.

<p class="mathjax">One of the major challenges today lies in the creation of governance concepts
for regional development that not only promote growth but, at the same time,
ensure promotion of inclusiveness, fairness, and resilience. Digital twins can
support policymakers in developing smart, sustainable solutions for cities and
regions and, therefore, urban and non-urban environments. The project SCiNDTiLA
(Smart Cities aNd Digital Twins in Lower Austria) aims to define the
state-of-the-art in the field of smart cities, identify interdependencies,
critical components and stakeholders, and provide a roadmap for smart cities
with application to both smaller-scale urban and non-urban environments.
SCiNDTiLA uses the foundations of complexity theory and computational social
science methods to model Austrian towns and regions as smart cities/regions and
thus as systems of socio-technical interaction to guide policy decision-making
toward sustainable development.

<p class="mathjax">The evolution of existing transportation systems,mainly driven by
urbanization and increased availability of mobility options, such as private,
profit-maximizing ride-hailing companies, calls for tools to reason about their
design and regulation. To study this complex socio-technical problem, one needs
to account for the strategic interactions of the heterogeneous stakeholders
involved in the mobility ecosystem and analyze how they influence the system.
In this paper, we focus on the interactions between citizens who compete for
the limited resources of a mobility system to complete their desired trip.
Specifically, we present a game-theoretic framework for multi-modal mobility
systems, where citizens, characterized by heterogeneous preferences, have
access to various mobility options and seek individually-optimal decisions. We
study the arising game and prove the existence of an equilibrium, which can be
efficiently computed via a convex optimization problem. Through both an
analytical and a numerical case study for the classic scenario of Sioux Falls,
USA, we illustrate the capabilities of our model and perform sensitivity
analyses. Importantly, we show how to embed our framework into a "larger" game
among stakeholders of the mobility ecosystem (e.g., municipality, Mobility
Service Providers, and citizens), effectively giving rise to tools to inform
strategic interventions and policy-making in the mobility ecosystem.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis via implicit scene representation. However, it usually suffers from
poor scalability as requiring densely sampled images for each new scene.
Several studies have attempted to mitigate this problem by integrating
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) technique into NeRF while they still entail a
cumbersome fine-tuning process for new scenes. Notably, the rendering quality
will drop severely without this fine-tuning process and the errors mainly
appear around the high-frequency features. In the light of this observation, we
design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and
NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene
optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature
volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating
the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which
disentangles high-frequency information explicitly. With that, disentangled
frequency features can be injected into classic NeRF via a novel hybrid neural
renderer to yield faithful high-frequency details, and an intuitive
frequency-guided sampling strategy can be designed to suppress artifacts around
high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments over three widely studied
benchmarks show that WaveNeRF achieves superior generalizable radiance field
modeling when only given three images as input.

<p class="mathjax">The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has recently shown
remarkable generalization on "zero-shot" training and has applied to many
downstream tasks. We explore the adaptation of CLIP to achieve a more efficient
and generalized action recognition method. We propose that the key lies in
explicitly modeling the motion cues flowing in video frames. To that end, we
design a two-stream motion modeling block to capture motion and spatial
information at the same time. And then, the obtained motion cues are utilized
to drive a dynamic prompts learner to generate motion-aware prompts, which
contain much semantic information concerning human actions. In addition, we
propose a multimodal communication block to achieve a collaborative learning
and further improve the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on
HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400 datasets. Our method outperforms most
existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on "few-shot" and
"zero-shot" training. We also achieve competitive performance on "closed-set"
training with extremely few trainable parameters and additional computational
costs.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, semantic segmentation models trained with image-level text
supervision have shown promising results in challenging open-world scenarios.
However, these models still face difficulties in learning fine-grained semantic
alignment at the pixel level and predicting accurate object masks. To address
this issue, we propose MixReorg, a novel and straightforward pre-training
paradigm for semantic segmentation that enhances a model's ability to
reorganize patches mixed across images, exploring both local visual relevance
and global semantic coherence. Our approach involves generating fine-grained
patch-text pairs data by mixing image patches while preserving the
correspondence between patches and text. The model is then trained to minimize
the segmentation loss of the mixed images and the two contrastive losses of the
original and restored features. With MixReorg as a mask learner, conventional
text-supervised semantic segmentation models can achieve highly generalizable
pixel-semantic alignment ability, which is crucial for open-world segmentation.
After training with large-scale image-text data, MixReorg models can be applied
directly to segment visual objects of arbitrary categories, without the need
for further fine-tuning. Our proposed framework demonstrates strong performance
on popular zero-shot semantic segmentation benchmarks, outperforming GroupViT
by significant margins of 5.0%, 6.2%, 2.5%, and 3.4% mIoU on PASCAL VOC2012,
PASCAL Context, MS COCO, and ADE20K, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Current talking face generation methods mainly focus on speech-lip
synchronization. However, insufficient investigation on the facial talking
style leads to a lifeless and monotonous avatar. Most previous works fail to
imitate expressive styles from arbitrary video prompts and ensure the
authenticity of the generated video. This paper proposes an unsupervised
variational style transfer model (VAST) to vivify the neutral photo-realistic
avatars. Our model consists of three key components: a style encoder that
extracts facial style representations from the given video prompts; a hybrid
facial expression decoder to model accurate speech-related movements; a
variational style enhancer that enhances the style space to be highly
expressive and meaningful. With our essential designs on facial style learning,
our model is able to flexibly capture the expressive facial style from
arbitrary video prompts and transfer it onto a personalized image renderer in a
zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach
contributes to a more vivid talking avatar with higher authenticity and richer
expressiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Activation functions are essential components of neural networks. In this
paper, we introduce a new activation function called the Truncated and Signed
Square Root (TSSR) function. This function is distinctive because it is odd,
nonlinear, monotone and differentiable. Its gradient is continuous and always
positive. Thanks to these properties, it has the potential to improve the
numerical stability of neural networks. Several experiments confirm that the
proposed TSSR has better performance than other stat-of-the-art activation
functions. The proposed function has significant implications for the
development of neural network models and can be applied to a wide range of
applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing,
and speech recognition.

<p class="mathjax">Recent adaptive methods for efficient video recognition mostly follow the
two-stage paradigm of "preview-then-recognition" and have achieved great
success on multiple video benchmarks. However, this two-stage paradigm involves
two visits of raw frames from coarse-grained to fine-grained during inference
(cannot be parallelized), and the captured spatiotemporal features cannot be
reused in the second stage (due to varying granularity), being not friendly to
efficiency and computation optimization. To this end, inspired by human
cognition, we propose a novel recognition paradigm of "View while Moving" for
efficient long-untrimmed video recognition. In contrast to the two-stage
paradigm, our paradigm only needs to access the raw frame once. The two phases
of coarse-grained sampling and fine-grained recognition are combined into
unified spatiotemporal modeling, showing great performance. Moreover, we
investigate the properties of semantic units in video and propose a
hierarchical mechanism to efficiently capture and reason about the unit-level
and video-level temporal semantics in long-untrimmed videos respectively.
Extensive experiments on both long-untrimmed and short-trimmed videos
demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy as well as efficiency, yielding new efficiency and accuracy trade-offs
for video spatiotemporal modeling.

diversity in quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), which is an
optimization approach motivated by concepts in quantum mechanics and PSO. In
order to gain an in-depth understanding of the role the diversity plays in the
evolving process, we first define the genotype diversity by the distance to the
average point of the particles' positions and the phenotype diversity by the
fitness values for the QPSO. Then, the correlations between the two types of
diversities and the search performance are tested and analyzed on several
benchmark functions, and the distance-to-average-point diversity is showed to
have stronger association with the search performance during the evolving
processes. Finally, in the light of the performed diversity analyses, two
strategies for controlling the distance-to-average-point diversities are
proposed for the purpose of improving the search ability of the QPSO algorithm.
Empirical studies on the QPSO with the introduced diversity control methods are
performed on a set of benchmark functions from the CEC 2005 benchmark suite.
The performance of the proposed methods are evaluated and compared with the
original QPSO and other PSO variants.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic interactions between merging and highway vehicles are a major topic
of research, yielding many empirical studies and models of driver behaviour.
Most of these studies on merging use naturalistic data. Although this provides
insight into human gap acceptance and traffic flow effects, it obscures the
operational inputs of interacting drivers. Besides that, researchers have no
control over the vehicle kinematics (i.e., positions and velocities) at the
start of the interactions. Therefore the relationship between initial
kinematics and the outcome of the interaction is difficult to investigate. To
address these gaps, we conducted an experiment in a coupled driving simulator
with a simplified, top-down view, merging scenario with two vehicles. We found
that kinematics can explain the outcome (i.e., which driver merges first) and
the duration of the merging conflict. Furthermore, our results show that
drivers use key decision moments combined with constant acceleration inputs
(intermittent piecewise-constant control) during merging. This indicates that
they do not continuously optimize their expected utility. Therefore, these
results advocate the development of interaction models based on intermittent
piecewise-constant control. We hope our work can contribute to this development
and to the fundamental knowledge of interactive driver behaviour.

<p class="mathjax">Many multi-agent systems require inter-agent communication to properly
achieve their goal. By learning the communication protocol alongside the action
protocol using multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, the agents gain
the flexibility to determine which information should be shared. However, when
the number of agents increases we need to create an encoding of the information
contained in these messages. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
increasing the amount of information that should be contained in a message and
increasing the number of agents. We evaluate these effects on two different
message encoding methods, the mean message encoder and the attention message
encoder. We perform our experiments on a matrix environment. Surprisingly, our
results show that the mean message encoder consistently outperforms the
attention message encoder. Therefore, we analyse the communication protocol
used by the agents that use the mean message encoder and can conclude that the
agents use a combination of an exponential and a logarithmic function in their
communication policy to avoid the loss of important information after applying
the mean message encoder.

<p class="mathjax">The joint replenishment problem (JRP) is a classical inventory management
problem. We consider a natural generalization with outliers, where we are
allowed to reject (that is, not service) a subset of demand points. In this
paper, we are motivated by issues of fairness - if we do not serve all of the
demands, we wish to ``spread out the pain'' in a balanced way among customers,
communities, or any specified market segmentation. One approach is to constrain
the rejections allowed, and to have separate bounds for each given customer. In
our most general setting, we consider a set of C features, where each demand
point has an associated rejection cost for each feature, and we have a given
bound on the allowed rejection cost incurred in total for each feature. This
generalizes a model of fairness introduced in earlier work on the Colorful
k-Center problem in which (analogously) each demand point has a given color,
and we bound the number of rejections of each color class.
<br />We give the first constant approximation algorithms for the
fairness-constrained JRP with a constant number of features; specifically, we
give a 2.86-approximation algorithm in this case. Even for the special case in
which we bound the total (weighted) number of outliers, this performance
guarantee improves upon bounds previously known for this case. Our approach is
an LP-based algorithm that splits the instance into two subinstances. One is
solved by a novel iterative rounding approach and the other by pipage-based
rounding. The standard LP relaxation has an unbounded integrality gap, and
hence another key element of our algorithm is to strengthen the relaxation by
correctly guessing key attributes of the optimal solution, which are
sufficiently concise, so that we can enumerate over all possible guesses in
polynomial time - albeit exponential in C, the number of features.

<p class="mathjax">This study focuses on the critical aspect of robust state estimation for the
safe navigation of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV). Existing literature primarily
employs two prevalent techniques for state estimation, namely filtering-based
and graph-based approaches. Factor Graph (FG) is a graph-based approach,
constructed using Values and Factors for Maximum Aposteriori (MAP) estimation,
that offers a modular architecture that facilitates the integration of inputs
from diverse sensors. However, most FG-based architectures in current use
require explicit knowledge of sensor parameters and are designed for single
setups. To address these limitations, this research introduces a novel
plug-and-play FG-based state estimator capable of operating without predefined
sensor parameters. This estimator is suitable for deployment in multiple sensor
setups, offering convenience and providing comprehensive state estimation at a
high frequency, including mean and covariances. The proposed algorithm
undergoes rigorous validation using various sensor setups on two different
vehicles: a quadricycle and a shuttle bus. The algorithm provides accurate and
robust state estimation across diverse scenarios, even when faced with degraded
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements or complete outages.
These findings highlight the efficacy and reliability of the algorithm in
real-world AV applications.

<p class="mathjax">Very distinct strategies can be deployed to recognize and characterize an
unknown environment or a shape. A recent and promising approach, especially in
robotics, is to reduce the complexity of the exploratory units to a minimum.
Here, we show that this frugal strategy can be taken to the extreme by
exploiting the power of statistical geometry and introducing new invariant
features. We show that an elementary robot devoid of any orientation or
observation system, exploring randomly, can access global information about an
environment such as the values of the explored area and perimeter. The explored
shapes are of arbitrary geometry and may even non-connected. From a dictionary,
this most simple robot can thus identify various shapes such as famous
monuments and even read a text.

<p class="mathjax">The aggregate demand flexibility of a set of thermostatically controlled
residential loads (TCLs) can be represented by a virtual battery (VB) in order
to manage their participation in the electricity markets. For this purpose, it
is necessary to know in advance and with a high level of reliability the
maximum power that can be supplied by the aggregation of TCLs. A probability
function of the power that can be supplied by a VB is introduced. This
probability function is used to predict the demand flexibility using a new
experimental probabilistic method based on a combination of Monte Carlo
simulation and extremum search by bisection algorithm (MC\&amp;ESB). As a result,
the maximum flexibility power that a VB can provide with a certain guaranteed
probability is obtained. The performance and validity of the proposed method
are demonstrated in three different case studies where a VB bids its aggregate
power in the Spanish electricity balancing markets (SEBM).

<p class="mathjax">Conditional natural language generation methods often require either
expensive fine-tuning or training a large language model from scratch. Both are
unlikely to lead to good results without a substantial amount of data and
computational resources. Prompt learning without changing the parameters of a
large language model presents a promising alternative. It is a cost-effective
approach, while still achieving competitive results. While this procedure is
now established for zero- and few-shot text classification and structured
prediction, it has received limited attention in conditional text generation.
We present the first automatic prompt optimization approach for
emotion-conditioned text generation with instruction-fine-tuned models. Our
method uses an iterative optimization procedure that changes the prompt by
adding, removing, or replacing tokens. As objective function, we only require a
text classifier that measures the realization of the conditional variable in
the generated text. We evaluate the method on emotion-conditioned text
generation with a focus on event reports and compare it to manually designed
prompts that also act as the seed for the optimization procedure. The optimized
prompts achieve 0.75 macro-average F1 to fulfill the emotion condition in
contrast to manually designed seed prompts with only 0.22 macro-average F1.

<p class="mathjax">Our work studies the fair allocation of indivisible items to a set of agents,
and falls within the scope of establishing improved approximation guarantees.
It is well known by now that the classic solution concepts in fair division,
such as envy-freeness and proportionality, fail to exist in the presence of
indivisible items. Unfortunately, the lack of existence remains unresolved even
for some relaxations of envy-freeness, and most notably for the notion of EFX,
which has attracted significant attention in the relevant literature. This in
turn has motivated the quest for approximation algorithms, resulting in the
currently best known $(\phi-1)$-approximation guarantee by Amanatidis et al
(2020), where $\phi$ equals the golden ratio. So far, it has been notoriously
hard to obtain any further advancements beyond this factor. Our main
contribution is that we achieve better approximations, for certain special
cases, where the agents agree on their perception of some items in terms of
their worth. In particular, we first provide an algorithm with a
$2/3$-approximation, when the agents agree on what are the top $n$ items (but
not necessarily on their exact ranking), with $n$ being the number of agents.
To do so, we also study a general framework that can be of independent interest
for obtaining further guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">Symbolic planning is a powerful technique to solve complex tasks that require
long sequences of actions and can equip an intelligent agent with complex
behavior. The downside of this approach is the necessity for suitable symbolic
representations describing the state of the environment as well as the actions
that can change it. Traditionally such representations are carefully
hand-designed by experts for distinct problem domains, which limits their
transferability to different problems and environment complexities. In this
paper, we propose a novel concept to generalize symbolic actions using a given
entity hierarchy and observed similar behavior. In a simulated grid-based
kitchen environment, we show that type-generalized actions can be learned from
few observations and generalize to novel situations. Incorporating an
additional on-the-fly generalization mechanism during planning, unseen task
combinations, involving longer sequences, novel entities and unexpected
environment behavior, can be solved.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in full-head reconstruction have been obtained by optimizing
a neural field through differentiable surface or volume rendering to represent
a single scene. While these techniques achieve an unprecedented accuracy, they
take several minutes, or even hours, due to the expensive optimization process
required. In this work, we introduce InstantAvatar, a method that recovers
full-head avatars from few images (down to just one) in a few seconds on
commodity hardware. In order to speed up the reconstruction process, we propose
a system that combines, for the first time, a voxel-grid neural field
representation with a surface renderer. Notably, a naive combination of these
two techniques leads to unstable optimizations that do not converge to valid
solutions. In order to overcome this limitation, we present a novel statistical
model that learns a prior distribution over 3D head signed distance functions
using a voxel-grid based architecture. The use of this prior model, in
combination with other design choices, results into a system that achieves 3D
head reconstructions with comparable accuracy as the state-of-the-art with a
100x speed-up.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel way to improve the generalisation capacity of deep
learning models by reducing high correlations between neurons. For this, we
present two regularisation terms computed from the weights of a minimum
spanning tree of the clique whose vertices are the neurons of a given network
(or a sample of those), where weights on edges are correlation dissimilarities.
We provide an extensive set of experiments to validate the effectiveness of our
terms, showing that they outperform popular ones. Also, we demonstrate that
naive minimisation of all correlations between neurons obtains lower accuracies
than our regularisation terms, suggesting that redundancies play a significant
role in artificial neural networks, as evidenced by some studies in
neuroscience for real networks. We include a proof of differentiability of our
regularisers, thus developing the first effective topological persistence-based
regularisation terms that consider the whole set of neurons and that can be
applied to a feedforward architecture in any deep learning task such as
classification, data generation, or regression.

<p class="mathjax">This study proposes a simple method for multi-object tracking (MOT) of
players in a badminton court. We leverage two off-the-shelf cameras, one on the
top of the court and the other on the side of the court. The one on the top is
to track players' trajectories, while the one on the side is to analyze the
pixel features of players. By computing the correlations between adjacent
frames and engaging the information of the two cameras, MOT of badminton
players is obtained. This two-camera approach addresses the challenge of player
occlusion and overlapping in a badminton court, providing player trajectory
tracking and multi-angle analysis. The presented system offers insights into
the positions and movements of badminton players, thus serving as a coaching or
self-training tool for badminton players to improve their gaming strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Chatbots are capable of remembering and referencing previous conversations,
but does this enhance user engagement or infringe on privacy? To explore this
trade-off, we investigated the format of how a chatbot references previous
conversations with a user and its effects on a user's perceptions and privacy
concerns. In a three-week longitudinal between-subjects study, 169 participants
talked about their dental flossing habits to a chatbot that either, (1-None):
did not explicitly reference previous user utterances, (2-Verbatim): referenced
previous utterances verbatim, or (3-Paraphrase): used paraphrases to reference
previous utterances. Participants perceived Verbatim and Paraphrase chatbots as
more intelligent and engaging. However, the Verbatim chatbot also raised
privacy concerns with participants. To gain insights as to why people prefer
certain conditions or had privacy concerns, we conducted semi-structured
interviews with 15 participants. We discuss implications from our findings that
can help designers choose an appropriate format to reference previous user
utterances and inform in the design of longitudinal dialogue scripting.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, learning-based algorithms have achieved promising performance on
cross-spectral image patch matching, which, however, is still far from
satisfactory for practical application. On the one hand, a lack of large-scale
dataset with diverse scenes haunts its further improvement for learning-based
algorithms, whose performances and generalization rely heavily on the dataset
size and diversity. On the other hand, more emphasis has been put on feature
relation in the spatial domain whereas the scale dependency between features
has often been ignored, leading to performance degeneration especially when
encountering significant appearance variations for cross-spectral patches. To
address these issues, we publish, to be best of our knowledge, the largest
visible and Long-wave Infrared (LWIR) image patch matching dataset, termed
VL-CMIM, which contains 1300 pairs of strictly aligned visible and LWIR images
and over 2 million patch pairs covering diverse scenes such as asteroid, field,
country, build, street and water.In addition, a multi-domain feature relation
learning network (MD-FRN) is proposed. Input by the features extracted from a
four-branch network, both feature relations in spatial and scale domains are
learned via a spatial correlation module (SCM) and multi-scale adaptive
aggregation module (MSAG), respectively. To further aggregate the multi-domain
relations, a deep domain interactive mechanism (DIM) is applied, where the
learnt spatial-relation and scale-relation features are exchanged and further
input into MSCRM and SCM. This mechanism allows our model to learn interactive
cross-domain feature relations, leading to improved robustness to significant
appearance changes due to different modality.

<p class="mathjax">For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, a function $ f
: V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, . . . , diam(G)\} $ is called a $\textit{broadcast}$
on $G$. For each vertex $u \in V$, if there exists a vertex $v$ in $G$
(possibly, $u = v$) such that $f (v) &gt; 0$ and $d(u, v) \leq f (v)$, then $f$ is
called a $\textit{dominating broadcast}$ on $G$. The $\textit{cost}$ of the
dominating broadcast $f$ is the quantity $ \sum_{v\in V}f(v)$. The minimum cost
of a dominating broadcast is the \textit{broadcast domination number} of $G$,
denoted by $ \gamma_{b}(G) $. A $\textit{multipacking}$ is a set $S \subseteq
V$ in a graph $G = (V, E)$ such that for every vertex $v \in V$ and for every
integer $r \geq 1$, the ball of radius $r$ around $v$ contains at most $r$
vertices of $S$, that is, there are at most $r$ vertices in $S$ at a distance
at most $r$ from $v$ in $G$. The $\textit{multipacking number}$ of $G$ is the
maximum cardinality of a multipacking of $ G $ and is denoted by $ mp(G) $. We
show that, for any cactus graph $G$, $\gamma_b(G)\leq
\frac{3}{2}mp(G)+\frac{11}{2}$. We also show that $\gamma_b(G)-mp(G)$ can be
arbitrarily large for cactus graphs by constructing an infinite family of
cactus graphs such that the ratio $\gamma_b(G)/mp(G)=4/3$, with $mp(G)$
arbitrarily large. This result shows that, for cactus graphs, we cannot improve
the bound $\gamma_b(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}mp(G)+\frac{11}{2}$ to a bound in the
form $\gamma_b(G)\leq c_1\cdot mp(G)+c_2$, for any constant $c_1&lt;4/3$ and
$c_2$. Moreover, we provide an $O(n)$-time algorithm to construct a
multipacking of $G$ of size at least $\frac{2}{3}mp(G)-\frac{11}{3}$, where $n$
is the number of vertices of the graph $G$.

<p class="mathjax">We present a cross-linguistic study that aims to quantify vowel harmony using
data-driven computational modeling. Concretely, we define an
information-theoretic measure of harmonicity based on the predictability of
vowels in a natural language lexicon, which we estimate using phoneme-level
language models (PLMs). Prior quantitative studies have relied heavily on
inflected word-forms in the analysis of vowel harmony. We instead train our
models using cross-linguistically comparable lemma forms with little or no
inflection, which enables us to cover more under-studied languages. Training
data for our PLMs consists of word lists with a maximum of 1000 entries per
language. Despite the fact that the data we employ are substantially smaller
than previously used corpora, our experiments demonstrate the neural PLMs
capture vowel harmony patterns in a set of languages that exhibit this
phenomenon. Our work also demonstrates that word lists are a valuable resource
for typological research, and offers new possibilities for future studies on
low-resource, under-studied languages.

<p class="mathjax">Dialect classification is used in a variety of applications, such as machine
translation and speech recognition, to improve the overall performance of the
system. In a real-world scenario, a deployed dialect classification model can
encounter anomalous inputs that differ from the training data distribution,
also called out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Those OOD samples can lead to
unexpected outputs, as dialects of those samples are unseen during model
training. Out-of-distribution detection is a new research area that has
received little attention in the context of dialect classification. Towards
this, we proposed a simple yet effective unsupervised Mahalanobis distance
feature-based method to detect out-of-distribution samples. We utilize the
latent embeddings from all intermediate layers of a wav2vec 2.0
transformer-based dialect classifier model for multi-task learning. Our
proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art OOD detection methods
significantly.

<p class="mathjax">On the modern web, trackers and advertisers frequently construct and monetize
users' detailed behavioral profiles without consent. Despite various studies on
web tracking mechanisms and advertisements, there has been no rigorous study
focusing on websites targeted at children. To address this gap, we present a
measurement of tracking and (targeted) advertising on websites directed at
children. Motivated by lacking a comprehensive list of child-directed (i.e.,
targeted at children) websites, we first build a multilingual classifier based
on web page titles and descriptions. Applying this classifier to over two
million pages, we compile a list of two thousand child-directed websites.
Crawling these sites from five vantage points, we measure the prevalence of
trackers, fingerprinting scripts, and advertisements. Our crawler detects ads
displayed on child-directed websites and determines if ad targeting is enabled
by scraping ad disclosure pages whenever available. Our results show that
around 90% of child-directed websites embed one or more trackers, and about 27%
contain targeted advertisements--a practice that should require verifiable
parental consent. Next, we identify improper ads on child-directed websites by
developing an ML pipeline that processes both images and text extracted from
ads. The pipeline allows us to run semantic similarity queries for arbitrary
search terms, revealing ads that promote services related to dating, weight
loss, and mental health; as well as ads for sex toys and flirting chat
services. Some of these ads feature repulsive and sexually explicit imagery. In
summary, our findings indicate a trend of non-compliance with privacy
regulations and troubling ad safety practices among many advertisers and
child-directed websites. To protect children and create a safer online
environment, regulators and stakeholders must adopt and enforce more stringent
measures.

is to offer a quick guide to the most relevant and widely discussed research,
aiding both newcomers and established researchers in staying abreast of current
trends. In particular, we compile a list of the 40 most popular papers based on
normalized citation counts from the first half of 2023. We observe the
dominance of papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically
ChatGPT during the first half of 2023, with the latter showing signs of
declining popularity more recently, however. Further, NLP related papers are
the most influential (around 60\% of top papers) even though there are twice as
many ML related papers in our data. Core issues investigated in the most
heavily cited papers are: LLM efficiency, evaluation techniques, ethical
considerations, embodied agents, and problem-solving with LLMs. Additionally,
we examine the characteristics of top papers in comparison to others outside
the top-40 list (noticing the top paper's focus on LLM related issues and
higher number of co-authors) and analyze the citation distributions in our
dataset, among others.

<p class="mathjax">Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is in the spotlight as a definitive
solution for privacy, but the high computational overhead of FHE poses a
challenge to its practical adoption. Although prior studies have attempted to
design ASIC accelerators to mitigate the overhead, their designs require
excessive amounts of chip resources (e.g., areas) to contain and process
massive data for FHE operations.
<br />We propose CiFHER, a chiplet-based FHE accelerator with a resizable
structure, to tackle the challenge with a cost-effective multi-chip module
(MCM) design. First, we devise a flexible architecture of a chiplet core whose
configuration can be adjusted to conform to the global organization of chiplets
and design constraints. The distinctive feature of our core is a recomposable
functional unit providing varying computational throughput for number-theoretic
transform (NTT), the most dominant function in FHE. Then, we establish
generalized data mapping methodologies to minimize the network overhead when
organizing the chips into the MCM package in a tiled manner, which becomes a
significant bottleneck due to the technology constraints of MCMs. Also, we
analyze the effectiveness of various algorithms, including a novel limb
duplication algorithm, on the MCM architecture. A detailed evaluation shows
that a CiFHER package composed of 4 to 64 compact chiplets provides performance
comparable to state-of-the-art monolithic ASIC FHE accelerators with
significantly lower package-wide power consumption while reducing the area of a
single core to as small as 4.28mm$^2$.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, with the continuous development of the marine industry,
underwater image enhancement has attracted plenty of attention. Unfortunately,
the propagation of light in water will be absorbed by water bodies and
scattered by suspended particles, resulting in color deviation and low
contrast. To solve these two problems, we propose an Adaptive Transmission and
Dynamic Color guided network (named ATDCnet) for underwater image enhancement.
In particular, to exploit the knowledge of physics, we design an Adaptive
Transmission-directed Module (ATM) to better guide the network. To deal with
the color deviation problem, we design a Dynamic Color-guided Module (DCM) to
post-process the enhanced image color. Further, we design an
Encoder-Decoder-based Compensation (EDC) structure with attention and a
multi-stage feature fusion mechanism to perform color restoration and contrast
enhancement simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of the ATDCnet on multiple benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">As we increasingly depend on software systems, the consequences of breaches
in the software supply chain become more severe. High-profile cyber attacks
like those on SolarWinds and ShadowHammer have resulted in significant
financial and data losses, underlining the need for stronger cybersecurity. One
way to prevent future breaches is by studying past failures. However,
traditional methods of analyzing these failures require manually reading and
summarizing reports about them. Automated support could reduce costs and allow
analysis of more failures. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as
Large Language Models (LLMs) could be leveraged to assist the analysis of
failures. In this study, we assessed the ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to analyze historical software supply chain breaches. We used LLMs to
replicate the manual analysis of 69 software supply chain security failures
performed by members of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). We
developed prompts for LLMs to categorize these by four dimensions: type of
compromise, intent, nature, and impact. GPT 3.5s categorizations had an average
accuracy of 68% and Bard had an accuracy of 58% over these dimensions. We
report that LLMs effectively characterize software supply chain failures when
the source articles are detailed enough for consensus among manual analysts,
but cannot yet replace human analysts. Future work can improve LLM performance
in this context, and study a broader range of articles and failures.

<p class="mathjax">Video colorization, aiming at obtaining colorful and plausible results from
grayish frames, has aroused a lot of interest recently. Nevertheless, how to
maintain temporal consistency while keeping the quality of colorized results
remains challenging. To tackle the above problems, we present a
Histogram-guided Video Colorization with Spatial-Temporal connection structure
(named ST-HVC). To fully exploit the chroma and motion information, the joint
flow and histogram module is tailored to integrate the histogram and flow
features. To manage the blurred and artifact, we design a combination scheme
attending to temporal detail and flow feature combination. We further recombine
the histogram, flow and sharpness features via a U-shape network. Extensive
comparisons are conducted with several state-of-the-art image and video-based
methods, demonstrating that the developed method achieves excellent performance
both quantitatively and qualitatively in two video datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Differential equation discovery, a machine learning subfield, is used to
develop interpretable models, particularly in nature-related applications. By
expertly incorporating the general parametric form of the equation of motion
and appropriate differential terms, algorithms can autonomously uncover
equations from data. This paper explores the prerequisites and tools for
independent equation discovery without expert input, eliminating the need for
equation form assumptions. We focus on addressing the challenge of assessing
the adequacy of discovered equations when the correct equation is unknown, with
the aim of providing insights for reliable equation discovery without prior

<p class="mathjax">Video shakiness is an unpleasant distortion of User Generated Content (UGC)
videos, which is usually caused by the unstable hold of cameras. In recent
years, many video stabilization algorithms have been proposed, yet no specific
and accurate metric enables comprehensively evaluating the stability of videos.
Indeed, most existing quality assessment models evaluate video quality as a
whole without specifically taking the subjective experience of video stability
into consideration. Therefore, these models cannot measure the video stability
explicitly and precisely when severe shakes are present. In addition, there is
no large-scale video database in public that includes various degrees of shaky
videos with the corresponding subjective scores available, which hinders the
development of Video Quality Assessment for Stability (VQA-S). To this end, we
build a new database named StableDB that contains 1,952 diversely-shaky UGC
videos, where each video has a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on the degree of video
stability rated by 34 subjects. Moreover, we elaborately design a novel VQA-S
model named StableVQA, which consists of three feature extractors to acquire
the optical flow, semantic, and blur features respectively, and a regression
layer to predict the final stability score. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the StableVQA achieves a higher correlation with subjective opinions than
the existing VQA-S models and generic VQA models. The database and codes are
available at https://github.com/QMME/StableVQA.

<p class="mathjax">Congestion Control (CC) plays a fundamental role in optimizing traffic in
Data Center Networks (DCN). Currently, DCNs mainly implement two main CC
protocols: DCTCP and DCQCN. Both protocols -- and their main variants -- are
based on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), where intermediate switches
mark packets when they detect congestion. The ECN configuration is thus a
crucial aspect on the performance of CC protocols. Nowadays, network experts
set static ECN parameters carefully selected to optimize the average network
performance. However, today's high-speed DCNs experience quick and abrupt
changes that severely change the network state (e.g., dynamic traffic
workloads, incast events, failures). This leads to under-utilization and
sub-optimal performance. This paper presents GraphCC, a novel Machine
Learning-based framework for in-network CC optimization. Our distributed
solution relies on a novel combination of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and it is compatible with widely
deployed ECN-based CC protocols. GraphCC deploys distributed agents on switches
that communicate with their neighbors to cooperate and optimize the global ECN
configuration. In our evaluation, we test the performance of GraphCC under a
wide variety of scenarios, focusing on the capability of this solution to adapt
to new scenarios unseen during training (e.g., new traffic workloads, failures,
upgrades). We compare GraphCC with a state-of-the-art MARL-based solution for
ECN tuning -- ACC -- and observe that our proposed solution outperforms the
state-of-the-art baseline in all of the evaluation scenarios, showing
improvements up to $20\%$ in Flow Completion Time as well as significant
reductions in buffer occupancy ($38.0-85.7\%$).

<p class="mathjax">The problem of reconstructing brain activity from electric potential
measurements performed on the surface of a human head is not an easy task: not
just because the solution of the related inverse problem is fundamentally
ill-posed (not unique), but because the methods utilized in constructing a
synthetic forward solution themselves contain many inaccuracies. One of these
is the fact that the usual method of modelling primary currents in the human
head via dipoles brings about at least 2 modelling errors: one from the
singularity introduced by the dipole, and one from placing such dipoles near
conductivity discontinuities in the active brain layer boundaries.
<br />In this article we observe how the removal of possible source locations from
the surfaces of active brain layers affects the localisation accuracy of two
inverse methods, sLORETA and Dipole Scan, at different signal-to-noise ratios
(SNR), when the H(div) source model is used. We also describe the finite
element forward solver used to construct the synthetic EEG data, that was fed
to the inverse methods as input, in addition to the meshes that were used as
the domains of the forward and inverse solvers. Our results suggest that there
is a slight general improvement in the localisation results, especially at
lower noise levels. The applied inverse algorithm and brain compartment under
observation also affect the accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on the impact of leveraging autonomous offensive
approaches in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to train more robust agents by
exploring the impact of applying adversarial learning to DRL for autonomous
security in Software Defined Networks (SDN). Two algorithms, Double Deep
Q-Networks (DDQN) and Neural Episodic Control to Deep Q-Network (NEC2DQN or
N2D), are compared. NEC2DQN was proposed in 2018 and is a new member of the
deep q-network (DQN) family of algorithms. The attacker has full observability
of the environment and access to a causative attack that uses state
manipulation in an attempt to poison the learning process. The implementation
of the attack is done under a white-box setting, in which the attacker has
access to the defender's model and experiences. Two games are played; in the
first game, DDQN is a defender and N2D is an attacker, and in second game, the
roles are reversed. The games are played twice; first, without an active
causative attack and secondly, with an active causative attack. For execution,
three sets of game results are recorded in which a single set consists of 10
game runs. The before and after results are then compared in order to see if
there was actually an improvement or degradation. The results show that with
minute parameter changes made to the algorithms, there was growth in the
attacker's role, since it is able to win games. Implementation of the
adversarial learning by the introduction of the causative attack showed the
algorithms are still able to defend the network according to their strengths.

<p class="mathjax">Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games provide a fundamental method for proving
elementary equivalence (and equivalence up to a certain quantifier rank) of
relational structures. We investigate the soundness and completeness of this
method in the more general context of semiring semantics. Motivated originally
by provenance analysis of database queries, semiring semantics evaluates
logical statements not just by true or false, but by values in some commutative
semiring; this can provide much more detailed information, for instance
concerning the combinations of atomic facts that imply the truth of a
statement, or practical information about evaluation costs, confidence scores,
access levels or the number of successful evaluation strategies. There is a
wide variety of different semirings that are relevant for provenance analysis,
and the applicability of classical logical methods in semiring semantics may
strongly depend on the algebraic properties of the underlying semiring.
<br />While Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games are sound and complete for logical
equivalences in classical semantics, and thus on the Boolean semiring, this is
in general not the case for other semirings. We provide a detailed analysis of
the soundness and completeness of model comparison games on specific semirings,
not just for classical Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games but also for other
variants based on bijections or counting.
<br />Finally we propose a new kind of games, called homomorphism games, which are
based on the fact that there exist certain rather simple semiring
interpretations that are locally very different and can be separated even in a
one-move game, but which can be proved to be elementarily equivalent via
separating sets of homomorphisms into the Boolean semiring. We prove that these
homomorphism games provide a sound and complete method for logical equivalences
on finite and infinite lattice semirings.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image analysis using deep learning is often challenged by limited
labeled data and high annotation costs. Fine-tuning the entire network in
label-limited scenarios can lead to overfitting and suboptimal performance.
Recently, prompt tuning has emerged as a more promising technique that
introduces a few additional tunable parameters as prompts to a task-agnostic
pre-trained model, and updates only these parameters using supervision from
limited labeled data while keeping the pre-trained model unchanged. However,
previous work has overlooked the importance of selective labeling in downstream
tasks, which aims to select the most valuable downstream samples for annotation
to achieve the best performance with minimum annotation cost. To address this,
we propose a framework that combines selective labeling with prompt tuning
(SLPT) to boost performance in limited labels. Specifically, we introduce a
feature-aware prompt updater to guide prompt tuning and a TandEm Selective
LAbeling (TESLA) strategy. TESLA includes unsupervised diversity selection and
supervised selection using prompt-based uncertainty. In addition, we propose a
diversified visual prompt tuning strategy to provide multi-prompt-based
discrepant predictions for TESLA. We evaluate our method on liver tumor
segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
traditional fine-tuning with only 6% of tunable parameters, also achieving 94%
of full-data performance by labeling only 5% of the data.

<p class="mathjax">Live commerce is the act of selling products online through live streaming.
The customer's diverse demands for online products introduce more challenges to
Livestreaming Product Recognition. Previous works have primarily focused on
fashion clothing data or utilize single-modal input, which does not reflect the
real-world scenario where multimodal data from various categories are present.
In this paper, we present LPR4M, a large-scale multimodal dataset that covers
34 categories, comprises 3 modalities (image, video, and text), and is 50?
larger than the largest publicly available dataset. LPR4M contains diverse
videos and noise modality pairs while exhibiting a long-tailed distribution,
resembling real-world problems. Moreover, a cRoss-vIew semantiC alignmEnt
(RICE) model is proposed to learn discriminative instance features from the
image and video views of the products. This is achieved through instance-level
contrastive learning and cross-view patch-level feature propagation. A novel
Patch Feature Reconstruction loss is proposed to penalize the semantic
misalignment between cross-view patches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RICE and provide insights into the importance of dataset
diversity and expressivity. The dataset and code are available at

<p class="mathjax">E-commerce authoring involves creating attractive, abundant, and targeted
promotional content to drive product sales. The emergence of large language
models (LLMs) introduces an innovative paradigm, offering a unified solution to
address various authoring tasks within this scenario. However, mainstream LLMs
trained on general corpora with common sense knowledge reveal limitations in
fitting complex and personalized features unique to e-commerce products and
customers. Furthermore, LLMs like GPT-3.5 necessitate remote accessibility,
raising concerns about safeguarding voluminous customer privacy data during
transmission. This paper proposes the LLaMA-E, the unified and customized
instruction-following language models focusing on diverse e-commerce authoring
tasks. Specifically, the domain experts create the seed instruction set from
the tasks of ads generation, query-enhanced product title rewriting, product
classification, purchase intent speculation, and general Q&amp;A. These tasks
enable the models to comprehensively understand precise e-commerce authoring
knowledge by interleaving features covering typical service aspects of
customers, sellers, and platforms. The GPT-3.5 is introduced as a teacher
model, which expands the seed instructions to form a training set for the
LLaMA-E models with various scales. The experimental results show that the
proposed LLaMA-E models achieve state-of-the-art results in quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, also exhibiting the advantage in zero-shot scenes. To
the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to serve the LLMs to
specific e-commerce authoring scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Metaverse enables users to communicate, collaborate and socialize with each
other through their digital avatars. Due to the spatio-temporal
characteristics, co-located users are served well by performing their software
components in a collaborative manner such that a Metaverse service provider
(MSP) eliminates redundant data transmission and processing, ultimately
reducing the total energy consumption. The energyefficient service provision is
crucial for enabling the green and sustainable Metaverse. In this article, we
take an augmented reality (AR) application as an example to achieve this goal.
Moreover, we study an economic issue on how the users reserve offloading
services from the MSP and how the MSP determines an optimal charging price
since each user is rational to decide whether to accept the offloading service
by taking into account the monetary cost. A single-leader multi-follower
Stackelberg game is formulated between the MSP and users while each user
optimizes an offloading probability to minimize the weighted sum of time,
energy consumption and monetary cost. Numerical results show that our scheme
achieves energy savings and satisfies individual rationality simultaneously
compared with the conventional schemes. Finally, we identify and discuss open
directions on how several emerging technologies are combined with the
sustainable green Metaverse.

<p class="mathjax">Static meshes with texture maps have attracted considerable attention in both
industrial manufacturing and academic research, leading to an urgent
requirement for effective and robust objective quality evaluation. However,
current model-based static mesh quality metrics have obvious limitations: most
of them only consider geometry information, while color information is ignored,
and they have strict constraints for the meshes' geometrical topology. Other
metrics, such as image-based and point-based metrics, are easily influenced by
the prepossessing algorithms, e.g., projection and sampling, hampering their
ability to perform at their best. In this paper, we propose Geodesic Patch
Similarity (GeodesicPSIM), a novel model-based metric to accurately predict
human perception quality for static meshes. After selecting a group keypoints,
1-hop geodesic patches are constructed based on both the reference and
distorted meshes cleaned by an effective mesh cleaning algorithm. A two-step
patch cropping algorithm and a patch texture mapping module refine the size of
1-hop geodesic patches and build the relationship between the mesh geometry and
color information, resulting in the generation of 1-hop textured geodesic
patches. Three types of features are extracted to quantify the distortion:
patch color smoothness, patch discrete mean curvature, and patch pixel color
average and variance. To the best of our knowledge, GeodesicPSIM is the first
model-based metric especially designed for static meshes with texture maps.
GeodesicPSIM provides state-of-the-art performance in comparison with
image-based, point-based, and video-based metrics on a newly created and
challenging database. We also prove the robustness of GeodesicPSIM by
introducing different settings of hyperparameters. Ablation studies also
exhibit the effectiveness of three proposed features and the patch cropping
algorithm.

main targets of A/B testing are algorithms and visual elements. Single classic
A/B tests are the dominating type of tests. Stakeholders have three main roles
in the design of A/B tests: concept designer, experiment architect, and setup
technician. The primary types of data collected during the execution of A/B
tests are product/system data and user-centric data. The dominating use of the
test results are feature selection, feature rollout, and continued feature
development. Stakeholders have two main roles during A/B test execution:
experiment coordinator and experiment assessor. The main reported open problems
are enhancement of proposed approaches and their usability. Interesting lines
for future research include: strengthen the adoption of statistical methods in
A/B testing, improving the process of A/B testing, and enhancing the automation
of A/B testing.

<p class="mathjax">We propose JEDI, a multi-dataset semi-supervised learning method, which
efficiently combines knowledge from multiple experts, learned on different
datasets, to train and improve the performance of individual, per dataset,
student models. Our approach achieves this by addressing two important problems
in current machine learning research: generalization across datasets and
limitations of supervised training due to scarcity of labeled data. We start
with an arbitrary number of experts, pretrained on their own specific dataset,
which form the initial set of student models. The teachers are immediately
derived by concatenating the feature representations from the penultimate
layers of the students. We then train all models in a student-teacher
semi-supervised learning scenario until convergence. In our efficient approach,
student-teacher training is carried out jointly and end-to-end, showing that
both students and teachers improve their generalization capacity during
training. We validate our approach on four video action recognition datasets.
By simultaneously considering all datasets within a unified semi-supervised
setting, we demonstrate significant improvements over the initial experts.

<p class="mathjax">Communication is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning when agents
are not able to observe the full state of the environment. The most common
approach to allow learned communication between agents is the use of a
differentiable communication channel that allows gradients to flow between
agents as a form of feedback. However, this is challenging when we want to use
discrete messages to reduce the message size, since gradients cannot flow
through a discrete communication channel. Previous work proposed methods to
deal with this problem. However, these methods are tested in different
communication learning architectures and environments, making it hard to
compare them. In this paper, we compare several state-of-the-art discretization
methods as well as a novel approach. We do this comparison in the context of
communication learning using gradients from other agents and perform tests on
several environments. In addition, we present COMA-DIAL, a communication
learning approach based on DIAL and COMA extended with learning rate scaling
and adapted exploration. Using COMA-DIAL allows us to perform experiments on
more complex environments. Our results show that the novel ST-DRU method,
proposed in this paper, achieves the best results out of all discretization
methods across the different environments. It achieves the best or close to the
best performance in each of the experiments and is the only method that does
not fail on any of the tested environments.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) Services have significant
potential in digital content creation. The distinctive abilities of AIGC, such
as content generation based on minimal input, hold huge potential, especially
when integrating with semantic communication (SemCom). In this paper, a novel
comprehensive conceptual model for the integration of AIGC and SemCom is
developed. Particularly, a content generation level is introduced on top of the
semantic level that provides a clear outline of how AIGC and SemCom interact
with each other to produce meaningful and effective content. Moreover, a novel
framework that employs AIGC technology is proposed as an encoder and decoder
for semantic information, considering the joint optimization of semantic
extraction and evaluation metrics tailored to AIGC services. The framework can
adapt to different types of content generated, the required quality, and the
semantic information utilized. By employing a Deep Q Network (DQN), a case
study is presented that provides useful insights into the feasibility of the
optimization problem and its convergence characteristics.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with differential privacy have been proposed to
preserve graph privacy when nodes represent personal and sensitive information.
However, the existing methods ignore that nodes with different importance may
yield diverse privacy demands, which may lead to over-protect some nodes and
decrease model utility. In this paper, we study the problem of
importance-grained privacy, where nodes contain personal data that need to be
kept private but are critical for training a GNN. We propose NAP-GNN, a
node-importance-grained privacy-preserving GNN algorithm with privacy
guarantees based on adaptive differential privacy to safeguard node
information. First, we propose a Topology-based Node Importance Estimation
(TNIE) method to infer unknown node importance with neighborhood and centrality
awareness. Second, an adaptive private aggregation method is proposed to
perturb neighborhood aggregation from node-importance-grain. Third, we propose
to privately train a graph learning algorithm on perturbed aggregations in
adaptive residual connection mode over multi-layers convolution for node-wise
tasks. Theoretically analysis shows that NAP-GNN satisfies privacy guarantees.
Empirical experiments over real-world graph datasets show that NAP-GNN achieves
a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection (AD) in images, identifying significant deviations from
normality, is a critical issue in computer vision. This paper introduces a
novel approach to dimensionality reduction for AD using pre-trained
convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporate EfficientNet models. We
investigate the importance of component selection and propose two types of tree
search approaches, both employing a greedy strategy, for optimal eigencomponent
selection. Our study conducts three main experiments to evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach. The first experiment explores the influence of
test set performance on component choice, the second experiment examines the
performance when we train on one anomaly type and evaluate on all other types,
and the third experiment investigates the impact of using a minimum number of
images for training and selecting them based on anomaly types. Our approach
aims to find the optimal subset of components that deliver the highest
performance score, instead of focusing solely on the proportion of variance
explained by each component and also understand the components behaviour in
different settings. Our results indicate that the proposed method surpasses
both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Negated Principal Component
Analysis (NPCA) in terms of detection accuracy, even when using fewer
components. Thus, our approach provides a promising alternative to conventional
dimensionality reduction techniques in AD, and holds potential to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness of AD systems.

<p class="mathjax">The recent development and success of Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitate an evaluation of their performance across diverse NLP tasks in
different languages. Although several frameworks have been developed and made
publicly available, their customization capabilities for specific tasks and
datasets are often complex for different users. In this study, we introduce the
LLMeBench framework. Initially developed to evaluate Arabic NLP tasks using
OpenAI's GPT and BLOOM models; it can be seamlessly customized for any NLP task
and model, regardless of language. The framework also features zero- and
few-shot learning settings. A new custom dataset can be added in less than 10
minutes, and users can use their own model API keys to evaluate the task at
hand. The developed framework has been already tested on 31 unique NLP tasks
using 53 publicly available datasets within 90 experimental setups, involving
approximately 296K data points. We plan to open-source the framework for the
community (https://github.com/qcri/LLMeBench/). A video demonstrating the
framework is available online (https://youtu.be/FkQn4UjYA0s).

<p class="mathjax">Generalisation of deep neural networks becomes vulnerable when distribution
shifts are encountered between train (source) and test (target) domain data.
Few-shot domain adaptation mitigates this issue by adapting deep neural
networks pre-trained on the source domain to the target domain using a randomly
selected and annotated support set from the target domain. This paper argues
that randomly selecting the support set can be further improved for effectively
adapting the pre-trained source models to the target domain. Alternatively, we
propose SelectNAdapt, an algorithm to curate the selection of the target domain
samples, which are then annotated and included in the support set. In
particular, for the K-shot adaptation problem, we first leverage
self-supervision to learn features of the target domain data. Then, we propose
a per-class clustering scheme of the learned target domain features and select
K representative target samples using a distance-based scoring function.
Finally, we bring our selection setup towards a practical ground by relying on
pseudo-labels for clustering semantically similar target domain samples. Our
experiments show promising results on three few-shot domain adaptation
benchmarks for image recognition compared to related approaches and the
standard random selection.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the unbalanced training data distribution, the language ability of
large language models (LLMs) is often biased towards English. In this paper, we
propose to empower pre-trained LLMs on non-English languages by building
semantic alignment across languages. We perform instruction-tuning on LLaMA
with both translation task data and cross-lingual general task data to obtain
cross-lingual models (x-LLaMA). Experiment results on cross-lingual benchmark
XQUAD and MLQA show that x-LLaMA models outperform the English
instruction-tuned counterpart (Alpaca) by 42.50% on average on six non-English
languages. Further experiments on Chinese benchmark C-Eval show that x-LLaMA
achieves significant improvement on Chinese humanities tasks, outperforming
Alpaca by 8.2%. We also discover that incorporating non-English text on the
target side of translation data is particularly effective for boosting
non-English ability. Besides, we find that semantic alignment within LLM can be
further strengthened as translation task data scales up and we present the
formulation of the underlying scaling law. Evaluation results on translation
dataset Flores-101 show that \method outperforms previous LLaMA-based models in
all evaluated directions. Code and data will be available at:

<p class="mathjax">End-to-end weakly supervised semantic segmentation aims at optimizing a
segmentation model in a single-stage training process based on only image
annotations. Existing methods adopt an online-trained classification branch to
provide pseudo annotations for supervising the segmentation branch. However,
this strategy makes the classification branch dominate the whole concurrent
training process, hindering these two branches from assisting each other. In
our work, we treat these two branches equally by viewing them as diverse ways
to generate the segmentation map, and add interactions on both their
supervision and operation to achieve mutual promotion. For this purpose, a
bidirectional supervision mechanism is elaborated to force the consistency
between the outputs of these two branches. Thus, the segmentation branch can
also give feedback to the classification branch to enhance the quality of
localization seeds. Moreover, our method also designs interaction operations
between these two branches to exchange their knowledge to assist each other.
Experiments indicate our work outperforms existing end-to-end weakly supervised
segmentation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Fake news is fake material in a news media format but is not processed
properly by news agencies. The fake material can provoke or defame significant
entities or individuals or potentially even for the personal interests of the
creators, causing problems for society. Distinguishing fake news and real news
is challenging due to limited of domain knowledge and time constraints.
According to the survey, the top three areas most exposed to hoaxes and
misinformation by residents are in Banten, DKI Jakarta and West Java. The model
of transformers is referring to an approach in the field of artificial
intelligence (AI) in natural language processing utilizing the deep learning
architectures. Transformers exercise a powerful attention mechanism to process
text in parallel and produce rich and contextual word representations. A
previous study indicates a superior performance of a transformer model known as
BERT over and above non transformer approach. However, some studies suggest the
performance can be improved with the use of improved BERT models known as
ALBERT and RoBERTa. However, the modified BERT models are not well explored for
detecting fake news in Bahasa Indonesia. In this research, we explore those
transformer models and found that ALBERT outperformed other models with 87.6%
accuracy, 86.9% precision, 86.9% F1-score, and 174.5 run-time (s/epoch)
respectively. Source code available at:

<p class="mathjax">Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) extends Few-shot Semantic
Segmentation (FSS) to simultaneously segment unseen classes and seen classes
during evaluation. Previous works leverage additional branch or prototypical
aggregation to eliminate the constrained setting of FSS. However,
representation division and embedding prejudice, which heavily results in poor
performance of GFSS, have not been synthetical considered. We address the
aforementioned problems by jointing the prototypical kernel learning and
open-set foreground perception. Specifically, a group of learnable kernels is
proposed to perform segmentation with each kernel in charge of a stuff class.
Then, we explore to merge the prototypical learning to the update of base-class
kernels, which is consistent with the prototype knowledge aggregation of
few-shot novel classes. In addition, a foreground contextual perception module
cooperating with conditional bias based inference is adopted to perform
class-agnostic as well as open-set foreground detection, thus to mitigate the
embedding prejudice and prevent novel targets from being misclassified as
background. Moreover, we also adjust our method to the Class Incremental
Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (CIFSS) which takes the knowledge of novel
classes in a incremental stream. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and
COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that our method performs better than previous
state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) has found many successes in wireless networks;
however, the implementation of FL has been hindered by the energy limitation of
mobile devices (MDs) and the availability of training data at MDs. How to
integrate wireless power transfer and mobile crowdsensing towards sustainable
FL solutions is a research topic entirely missing from the open literature.
This work for the first time investigates a resource allocation problem in
collaborative sensing-assisted sustainable FL (S2FL) networks with the goal of
minimizing the total completion time. We investigate a practical
harvesting-sensing-training-transmitting protocol in which energy-limited MDs
first harvest energy from RF signals, use it to gain a reward for user
participation, sense the training data from the environment, train the local
models at MDs, and transmit the model updates to the server. The total
completion time minimization problem of jointly optimizing power transfer,
transmit power allocation, data sensing, bandwidth allocation, local model
training, and data transmission is complicated due to the non-convex objective
function, highly non-convex constraints, and strongly coupled variables. We
propose a computationally-efficient path-following algorithm to obtain the
optimal solution via the decomposition technique. In particular, inner convex
approximations are developed for the resource allocation subproblem, and the
subproblems are performed alternatively in an iterative fashion. Simulation
results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed S2FL
algorithm in reducing the completion time up to 21.45% in comparison with other
benchmark schemes. Further, we investigate an extension of our work from
frequency division multiple access (FDMA) to non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) and show that NOMA can speed up the total completion time 8.36% on
average of the considered FL system.

<p class="mathjax">Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) introduces a new, efficient mode of
transportation with the use of vehicle autonomy and electrified aircraft to
provide increasingly autonomous transportation between previously underserved
markets. Safe and efficient navigation of low altitude aircraft through highly
dense environments requires the integration of a multitude of complex
observations, such as surveillance, knowledge of vehicle dynamics, and weather.
The processing and reasoning on these observations pose challenges due to the
various sources of uncertainty in the information while ensuring cooperation
with a variable number of aircraft in the airspace. These challenges coupled
with the requirement to make safety-critical decisions in real-time rule out
the use of conventional separation assurance techniques. We present a
decentralized reinforcement learning framework to provide autonomous
self-separation capabilities within AAM corridors with the use of speed and
vertical maneuvers. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process and
solved by developing a novel extension to the sample-efficient, off-policy soft
actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. We introduce the use of attention networks for
variable-length observation processing and a distributed computing architecture
to achieve high training sample throughput as compared to existing approaches.
A comprehensive numerical study shows that the proposed framework can ensure
safe and efficient separation of aircraft in high density, dynamic environments
with various sources of uncertainty.

<p class="mathjax">Privacy preservation has long been a concern in smart acoustic monitoring
systems, where speech can be passively recorded along with a target signal in
the system's operating environment. In this study, we propose the integration
of two commonly used approaches in privacy preservation: source separation and
adversarial representation learning. The proposed system learns the latent
representation of audio recordings such that it prevents differentiating
between speech and non-speech recordings. Initially, the source separation
network filters out some of the privacy-sensitive data, and during the
adversarial learning process, the system will learn privacy-preserving
representation on the filtered signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method by comparing our method against systems without source
separation, without adversarial learning, and without both. Overall, our
results suggest that the proposed system can significantly improve speech
privacy preservation compared to that of using source separation or adversarial
learning solely while maintaining good performance in the acoustic monitoring
task.

<p class="mathjax">Existing approaches for information cascade prediction fall into three main
categories: feature-driven methods, point process-based methods, and deep
learning-based methods. Among them, deep learning-based methods, characterized
by its superior learning and representation capabilities, mitigates the
shortcomings inherent of the other methods. However, current deep learning
methods still face several persistent challenges. In particular, accurate
representation of user attributes remains problematic due to factors such as
fake followers and complex network configurations. Previous algorithms that
focus on the sequential order of user activations often neglect the rich
insights offered by activation timing. Furthermore, these techniques often fail
to holistically integrate temporal and structural aspects, thus missing the
nuanced propagation trends inherent in information cascades.To address these
issues, we propose the Cross-Domain Information Fusion Framework (CasCIFF),
which is tailored for information cascade prediction. This framework exploits
multi-hop neighborhood information to make user embeddings robust. When
embedding cascades, the framework intentionally incorporates timestamps,
endowing it with the ability to capture evolving patterns of information
diffusion. In particular, the CasCIFF seamlessly integrates the tasks of user
classification and cascade prediction into a consolidated framework, thereby
allowing the extraction of common features that prove useful for all tasks, a
strategy anchored in the principles of multi-task learning.

<p class="mathjax">ModSecurity is widely recognized as the standard open-source Web Application
Firewall (WAF), maintained by the OWASP Foundation. It detects malicious
requests by matching them against the Core Rule Set, identifying well-known
attack patterns. Each rule in the CRS is manually assigned a weight, based on
the severity of the corresponding attack, and a request is detected as
malicious if the sum of the weights of the firing rules exceeds a given
threshold. In this work, we show that this simple strategy is largely
ineffective for detecting SQL injection (SQLi) attacks, as it tends to block
many legitimate requests, while also being vulnerable to adversarial SQLi
attacks, i.e., attacks intentionally manipulated to evade detection. To
overcome these issues, we design a robust machine learning model, named
AdvModSec, which uses the CRS rules as input features, and it is trained to
detect adversarial SQLi attacks. Our experiments show that AdvModSec, being
trained on the traffic directed towards the protected web services, achieves a
better trade-off between detection and false positive rates, improving the
detection rate of the vanilla version of ModSecurity with CRS by 21%. Moreover,
our approach is able to improve its adversarial robustness against adversarial
SQLi attacks by 42%, thereby taking a step forward towards building more robust
and trustworthy WAFs.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a deep learning based method for simulating the large bending
deformation of bilayer plates. Inspired by the greedy algorithm, we propose a
pre-training method on a series of nested domains, which can accelerate the
convergence of training and find the absolute minimizer more effectively. The
proposed method exhibits the capability to converge to an absolute minimizer,
overcoming the limitation of gradient flow methods getting trapped in local
minimizer basins. We showcase better performance for the relative energy errors
and relative $L^2$-errors of the minimizer through several numerical
experiments. Furthermore, our method successfully maintains the $L^2$-norm of
the isometric constraint, leading to improved solution accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">When it comes to in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the controller area network --
CAN -- bus dominates the market; automobiles manufactured and sold around the
world depend on the CAN bus for safety-critical communications between various
components of the vehicle (e.g., the engine, the transmission, the steering
column). Unfortunately, the CAN bus is inherently insecure; in fact, it
completely lacks controls such as authentication, authorization, and
confidentiality (i.e., encryption). Therefore, researchers have travailed to
develop automotive security enhancements. The automotive intrusion detection
system (IDS) is especially popular in the literature -- due to its relatively
low cost in terms of money, resource utilization, and implementation effort.
That said, developing and evaluating an automotive IDS is often challenging; if
researchers do not have access to a test vehicle, then they are forced to
depend on publicly available CAN data -- which is not without limitations. Lack
of access to adequate CAN data, then, becomes a barrier to entry into
automotive security research.
<br />We seek to lower that barrier to entry by introducing a new CAN dataset to
facilitate the development and evaluation of automotive IDSs. Our dataset,
dubbed can-train-and-test, provides CAN data from four different vehicles
produced by two different manufacturers. The attack captures for each vehicle
model are equivalent, enabling researchers to assess the ability of a given IDS
to generalize to different vehicle models and even different vehicle
manufacturers. Our dataset contains replayable .log files as well as labeled
and unlabeled .csv files, thereby meeting a variety of development and
evaluation needs. Furthermore, can-train-and-test offers nine unique attacks,
ranging from denial of service (DoS) to gear spoofing to standstill...

<p class="mathjax">Passive acoustic monitoring offers a scalable, non-invasive method for
tracking global biodiversity and anthropogenic impacts on species. Although
deep learning has become a vital tool for processing this data, current models
are inflexible, typically cover only a handful of species, and are limited by
data scarcity. In this work, we propose BioLingual, a new model for
bioacoustics based on contrastive language-audio pretraining. We first
aggregate bioacoustic archives into a language-audio dataset, called
AnimalSpeak, with over a million audio-caption pairs holding information on
species, vocalization context, and animal behavior. After training on this
dataset to connect language and audio representations, our model can identify
over a thousand species' calls across taxa, complete bioacoustic tasks
zero-shot, and retrieve animal vocalization recordings from natural text
queries. When fine-tuned, BioLingual sets a new state-of-the-art on nine tasks
in the Benchmark of Animal Sounds. Given its broad taxa coverage and ability to
be flexibly queried in human language, we believe this model opens new
paradigms in ecological monitoring and research, including free-text search on
the world's acoustic monitoring archives. We open-source our models, dataset,
and code.

distillation has emerged as a technique to quickly train models with lower
memory and time requirements. However, data distillation on text-based datasets
hasn't been explored much because of the challenges rising due to its discrete
nature. Additionally, existing dataset distillation methods often struggle to
generalize to new architectures. In the paper, we propose several data
distillation techniques for multilingual text classification datasets using
language-model-based learning methods. We conduct experiments to analyze their
performance in terms of classification strength, and cross-architecture
generalization. Furthermore, we investigate the language-specific fairness of
the data summaries generated by these methods. Our approach builds upon
existing techniques, enhancing cross-architecture generalization in the text

<p class="mathjax">A Point Distribution Model (PDM) is the basis of a Statistical Shape Model
(SSM) that relies on a set of landmark points to represent a shape and
characterize the shape variation. In this work, we present a self-supervised
approach to extract landmark points from a given registration model for the
PDMs. Based on the assumption that the landmarks are the points that have the
most influence on registration, existing works learn a point-based registration
model with a small number of points to estimate the landmark points that
influence the deformation the most. However, such approaches assume that the
deformation can be captured by point-based registration and quality landmarks
can be learned solely with the deformation capturing objective. We argue that
data with complicated deformations can not easily be modeled with point-based
registration when only a limited number of points is used to extract
influential landmark points. Further, landmark consistency is not assured in
existing approaches In contrast, we propose to extract landmarks based on a
given registration model, which is tailored for the target data, so we can
obtain more accurate correspondences. Secondly, to establish the anatomical
consistency of the predicted landmarks, we introduce a landmark discovery loss
to explicitly encourage the model to predict the landmarks that are
anatomically consistent across subjects. We conduct experiments on an
osteoarthritis progression prediction task and show our method outperforms
existing image-based and point-based approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Foreground object search (FOS) aims to find compatible foreground objects for
a given background image, producing realistic composite image. We observe that
competitive retrieval performance could be achieved by using a discriminator to
predict the compatibility of composite image, but this approach has
unaffordable time cost. To this end, we propose a novel FOS method via
distilling composite feature (DiscoFOS). Specifically, the abovementioned
discriminator serves as teacher network. The student network employs two
encoders to extract foreground feature and background feature. Their
interaction output is enforced to match the composite image feature from the
teacher network. Additionally, previous works did not release their datasets,
so we contribute two datasets for FOS task: S-FOSD dataset with synthetic
composite images and R-FOSD dataset with real composite images. Extensive
experiments on our two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method over previous approaches. The dataset and code are available at

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) combine different modal data (e.g., text
and image) for a comprehensive understanding of entities. Despite the recent
progress of large-scale MMKGs, existing MMKGs neglect the multi-aspect nature
of entities, limiting the ability to comprehend entities from various
perspectives. In this paper, we construct AspectMMKG, the first MMKG with
aspect-related images by matching images to different entity aspects.
Specifically, we collect aspect-related images from a knowledge base, and
further extract aspect-related sentences from the knowledge base as queries to
retrieve a large number of aspect-related images via an online image search
engine. Finally, AspectMMKG contains 2,380 entities, 18,139 entity aspects, and
645,383 aspect-related images. We demonstrate the usability of AspectMMKG in
entity aspect linking (EAL) downstream task and show that previous EAL models
achieve a new state-of-the-art performance with the help of AspectMMKG. To
facilitate the research on aspect-related MMKG, we further propose an
aspect-related image retrieval (AIR) model, that aims to correct and expand
aspect-related images in AspectMMKG. We train an AIR model to learn the
relationship between entity image and entity aspect-related images by
incorporating entity image, aspect, and aspect image information. Experimental
results indicate that the AIR model could retrieve suitable images for a given
entity w.r.t different aspects.

<p class="mathjax">The availability of large-scale authentic face databases has been crucial to
the significant advances made in face recognition research over the past
decade. However, legal and ethical concerns led to the recent retraction of
many of these databases by their creators, raising questions about the
continuity of future face recognition research without one of its key
resources. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a promising alternative to
privacy-sensitive authentic data for face recognition development. However,
recent synthetic datasets that are used to train face recognition models suffer
either from limitations in intra-class diversity or cross-class (identity)
discrimination, leading to less optimal accuracies, far away from the
accuracies achieved by models trained on authentic data. This paper targets
this issue by proposing IDiff-Face, a novel approach based on conditional
latent diffusion models for synthetic identity generation with realistic
identity variations for face recognition training. Through extensive
evaluations, our proposed synthetic-based face recognition approach pushed the
limits of state-of-the-art performances, achieving, for example, 98.00%
accuracy on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark, far ahead from the
recent synthetic-based face recognition solutions with 95.40% and bridging the
gap to authentic-based face recognition with 99.82% accuracy.

prospect. However, most equation discovery tools rely on gradient methods,
which offer limited control over parameters. An alternative approach is the
evolutionary equation discovery, which allows modification of almost every
optimization stage. In this paper, we examine the modifications that can be
introduced into the evolutionary operators of the equation discovery algorithm,
taking inspiration from directed evolution techniques employed in fields such
as chemistry and biology. The resulting approach, dubbed directed equation
discovery, demonstrates a greater ability to converge towards accurate
solutions than the conventional method. To support our findings, we present

<p class="mathjax">Solute transport in fluid-particle systems is a fundamental process in
numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. The simulation of it
necessitates the consideration of solid particles with intricate shapes and
sizes. To address this challenge, this study proposes the Random-Walk
Metaball-Imaging Discrete Element Lattice Boltzmann Method (RW-MI-DELBM). In
this model, we reconstruct particle geometries with the Metaball-Imaging
algorithm, capture the particle behavior using the Discrete Element Method
(DEM), simulate fluid behavior by the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), and
represent solute behavior through the Random Walk Method (RWM). Through the
integration of these techniques with specially designed boundary conditions, we
achieve to simulate the solute transport in fluid-particle systems comprising
complex particle morphologies. Thorough validations, including analytical
soluutions and experiments, are performed to assess the robustness and accuracy
of this framework. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can
accurately capture the complex dynamics of solute transport under strict mass
conservation. In particular, an investigation is carried out to assess the
influence of particle morphologies on solute transport in a 3D oscillator, with
a focus on identifying correlations between shape features and dispersion
coefficients. Notably, all selected shape features exhibited strong
correlations with the dispersion coefficient, indicating the significant
influence of particle shapes on transport phenomena. However, due to the
complexity of the relationship and the limited number of simulations, no clear
patterns could be observed. Further comprehensive analyses incorporating a
broader range of shape features and varying conditions are necessary to fully
comprehend their collective influence on the dispersion coefficient.

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing volume of astronomical data generated by modern survey
telescopes, automated pipelines and machine learning techniques have become
crucial for analyzing and extracting knowledge from these datasets. Anomaly
detection, i.e. the task of identifying irregular or unexpected patterns in the
data, is a complex challenge in astronomy. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Class Deep Support Vector Data Description (MCDSVDD), an extension of the
state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm One-Class Deep SVDD, specifically
designed to handle different inlier categories with distinct data
distributions. MCDSVDD uses a neural network to map the data into hyperspheres,
where each hypersphere represents a specific inlier category. The distance of
each sample from the centers of these hyperspheres determines the anomaly
score. We evaluate the effectiveness of MCDSVDD by comparing its performance
with several anomaly detection algorithms on a large dataset of astronomical
light-curves obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of MCDSVDD in detecting anomalous sources while
leveraging the presence of different inlier categories. The code and the data
needed to reproduce our results are publicly available at
https://github.com/mperezcarrasco/AnomalyALeRCE.

<p class="mathjax">Transit riders' feedback provided in ridership surveys, customer relationship
management (CRM) channels, and in more recent times, through social media is
key for transit agencies to better gauge the efficacy of their services and
initiatives. Getting a holistic understanding of riders' experience through the
feedback shared in those instruments is often challenging, mostly due to the
open-ended, unstructured nature of text feedback. In this paper, we propose
leveraging traditional transit CRM feedback to develop and deploy a
transit-topic-aware large language model (LLM) capable of classifying
open-ended text feedback to relevant transit-specific topics. First, we utilize
semi-supervised learning to engineer a training dataset of 11 broad transit
topics detected in a corpus of 6 years of customer feedback provided to the
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). We then use this
dataset to train and thoroughly evaluate a language model based on the RoBERTa
architecture. We compare our LLM, MetRoBERTa, to classical machine learning
approaches utilizing keyword-based and lexicon representations. Our model
outperforms those methods across all evaluation metrics, providing an average
topic classification accuracy of 90%. Finally, we provide a value proposition
of this work demonstrating how the language model, alongside additional text
processing tools, can be applied to add structure to open-ended text sources of
feedback like Twitter. The framework and results we present provide a pathway
for an automated, generalizable approach for ingesting, visualizing, and
reporting transit riders' feedback at scale, enabling agencies to better
understand and improve customer experience.

<p class="mathjax">Online groups have become increasingly prevalent, providing users with space
to share experiences and explore interests. Therefore, user-centric group
discovery task, i.e., recommending groups to users can help both users' online
experiences and platforms' long-term developments. Existing recommender methods
can not deal with this task as modeling user-group participation into a
bipartite graph overlooks their item-side interests. Although there exist a few
works attempting to address this task, they still fall short in fully
preserving the social context and ensuring effective interest representation
learning.
<br />In this paper, we focus on exploring the intents that motivate users to
participate in groups, which can be categorized into different types, like the
social-intent and the personal interest-intent. The former refers to users
joining a group affected by their social links, while the latter relates to
users joining groups with like-minded people for self-enjoyment. To comprehend
different intents, we propose a novel model, DiRec, that first models each
intent separately and then fuses them together for predictions. Specifically,
for social-intent, we introduce the hypergraph structure to model the
relationship between groups and members, leading to a richer understanding of
the social context. As for interest-intent, we employ novel structural
refinement on the interactive graph to uncover more intricate user behaviors
and group interests, realizing better representation learning of interests.
Furthermore, we also observe the intent overlapping in real-world scenarios and
devise a novel self-supervised learning loss that encourages such alignment for
final recommendations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the
significant improvement of DiRec over the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized machine learning solution to the
protection of users' private data, has become an important learning paradigm in
recent years, especially since the enforcement of stricter laws and regulations
in most countries. Therefore, a variety of FL frameworks are released to
facilitate the development and application of federated learning. Despite the
considerable amount of research on the security and privacy of FL models and
systems, the security issues in FL frameworks have not been systematically
studied yet. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study on 1,112 FL
framework bugs to investigate their characteristics. These bugs are manually
collected, classified, and labeled from 12 open-source FL frameworks on GitHub.
In detail, we construct taxonomies of 15 symptoms, 12 root causes, and 20 fix
patterns of these bugs and investigate their correlations and distributions on
23 logical components and two main application scenarios. From the results of
our study, we present nine findings, discuss their implications, and propound
several suggestions to FL framework developers and security researchers on the
FL frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">Novel Class Discovery (NCD) aims at inferring novel classes in an unlabeled
set by leveraging prior knowledge from a labeled set with known classes.
Despite its importance, there is a lack of theoretical foundations for NCD.
This paper bridges the gap by providing an analytical framework to formalize
and investigate when and how known classes can help discover novel classes.
Tailored to the NCD problem, we introduce a graph-theoretic representation that
can be learned by a novel NCD Spectral Contrastive Loss (NSCL). Minimizing this
objective is equivalent to factorizing the graph's adjacency matrix, which
allows us to derive a provable error bound and provide the sufficient and
necessary condition for NCD. Empirically, NSCL can match or outperform several
strong baselines on common benchmark datasets, which is appealing for practical
usage while enjoying theoretical guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">Weather forecasting is essential for decision-making and is usually performed
using numerical modeling. Numerical weather models, in turn, are complex tools
that require specialized training and laborious setup and are challenging even
for weather experts. Moreover, weather simulations are data-intensive
computations and may take hours to days to complete. When the simulation is
finished, the experts face challenges analyzing its outputs, a large mass of
spatiotemporal and multivariate data. From the simulation setup to the analysis
of results, working with weather simulations involves several manual and
error-prone steps. The complexity of the problem increases exponentially when
the experts must deal with ensembles of simulations, a frequent task in their
daily duties. To tackle these challenges, we propose ProWis: an interactive and
provenance-oriented system to help weather experts build, manage, and analyze
simulation ensembles at runtime. Our system follows a human-in-the-loop
approach to enable the exploration of multiple atmospheric variables and
weather scenarios. ProWis was built in close collaboration with weather
experts, and we demonstrate its effectiveness by presenting two case studies of
rainfall events in Brazil.

<p class="mathjax">While diffusion models have achieved promising performances in data
synthesis, they might suffer error propagation because of their cascade
structure, where the distributional mismatch spreads and magnifies through the
chain of denoising modules. However, a strict analysis is expected since many
sequential models such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) are free from error
propagation. In this paper, we empirically and theoretically verify that
diffusion models are indeed affected by error propagation and we then propose a
regularization to address this problem. Our theoretical analysis reveals that
the question can be reduced to whether every denoising module of the diffusion
model is fault-tolerant. We derive insightful transition equations, indicating
that the module can't recover from input errors and even propagates additional
errors to the next module. Our analysis directly leads to a consistency
regularization scheme for diffusion models, which explicitly reduces the
distribution gap between forward and backward processes. We further introduce a
bootstrapping algorithm to reduce the computation cost of the regularizer. Our
experimental results on multiple image datasets show that our regularization
effectively handles error propagation and significantly improves the
performance of vanilla diffusion models.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based methods have exhibited remarkable potential in single image
super-resolution (SISR) by effectively extracting long-range dependencies.
However, most of the current research in this area has prioritized the design
of transformer blocks to capture global information, while overlooking the
importance of incorporating high-frequency priors, which we believe could be
beneficial. In our study, we conducted a series of experiments and found that
transformer structures are more adept at capturing low-frequency information,
but have limited capacity in constructing high-frequency representations when
compared to their convolutional counterparts. Our proposed solution, the
cross-refinement adaptive feature modulation transformer (CRAFT), integrates
the strengths of both convolutional and transformer structures. It comprises
three key components: the high-frequency enhancement residual block (HFERB) for
extracting high-frequency information, the shift rectangle window attention
block (SRWAB) for capturing global information, and the hybrid fusion block
(HFB) for refining the global representation. Our experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that CRAFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to
0.29dB while using fewer parameters. The source code will be made available at:

<p class="mathjax">Perception that involves multi-object detection and tracking, and trajectory
prediction are two major tasks of autonomous driving. However, they are
currently mostly studied separately, which results in most trajectory
prediction modules being developed based on ground truth trajectories without
taking into account that trajectories extracted from the detection and tracking
modules in real-world scenarios are noisy. These noisy trajectories can have a
significant impact on the performance of the trajectory predictor and can lead
to serious prediction errors. In this paper, we build an end-to-end framework
for detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction called ODTP (Online
Detection, Tracking and Prediction). It adopts the state-of-the-art online
multi-object tracking model, QD-3DT, for perception and trains the trajectory
predictor, DCENet++, directly based on the detection results without purely
relying on ground truth trajectories. We evaluate the performance of ODTP on
the widely used nuScenes dataset for autonomous driving. Extensive experiments
show that ODPT achieves high performance end-to-end trajectory prediction.
DCENet++, with the enhanced dynamic maps, predicts more accurate trajectories
than its base model. It is also more robust when compared with other generative
and deterministic trajectory prediction models trained on noisy detection
results.

<p class="mathjax">One of the important bottlenecks in training modern object detectors is the
need for labeled images where bounding box annotations have to be produced for
each object present in the image. This bottleneck is further exacerbated in
aerial images where the annotators have to label small objects often
distributed in clusters on high-resolution images. In recent days, the
mean-teacher approach trained with pseudo-labels and weak-strong augmentation
consistency is gaining popularity for semi-supervised object detection.
However, a direct adaptation of such semi-supervised detectors for aerial
images where small clustered objects are often present, might not lead to
optimal results. In this paper, we propose a density crop-guided
semi-supervised detector that identifies the cluster of small objects during
training and also exploits them to improve performance at inference. During
training, image crops of clusters identified from labeled and unlabeled images
are used to augment the training set, which in turn increases the chance of
detecting small objects and creating good pseudo-labels for small objects on
the unlabeled images. During inference, the detector is not only able to detect
the objects of interest but also regions with a high density of small objects
(density crops) so that detections from the input image and detections from
image crops are combined, resulting in an overall more accurate object
prediction, especially for small objects. Empirical studies on the popular
benchmarks of VisDrone and DOTA datasets show the effectiveness of our density
crop-guided semi-supervised detector with an average improvement of more than
2\% over the basic mean-teacher method in COCO style AP. Our code is available

<p class="mathjax">Provenance graphs are structured audit logs that describe the history of a
system's execution. Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to
analyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing
particularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design
documents, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of
provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect
modern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack
agnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of
attack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host
systems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack
activity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand
and quickly respond to system intrusion?). We present KAIROS, the first PIDS
that simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas
existing approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable
detection performance.
<br />Kairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder
architecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's
structural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system
event. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack
footprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe
malicious activity over a stream of system audit logs. Using state-of-the-art
benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Kairos outperforms previous approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In human-AI collaboration systems for critical applications, in order to
ensure minimal error, users should set an operating point based on model
confidence to determine when the decision should be delegated to human experts.
Samples for which model confidence is lower than the operating point would be
manually analysed by experts to avoid mistakes. Such systems can become truly
useful only if they consider two aspects: models should be confident only for
samples for which they are accurate, and the number of samples delegated to
experts should be minimized. The latter aspect is especially crucial for
applications where available expert time is limited and expensive, such as
healthcare. The trade-off between the model accuracy and the number of samples
delegated to experts can be represented by a curve that is similar to an ROC
curve, which we refer to as confidence operating characteristic (COC) curve. In
this paper, we argue that deep neural networks should be trained by taking into
account both accuracy and expert load and, to that end, propose a new
complementary loss function for classification that maximizes the area under
this COC curve. This promotes simultaneously the increase in network accuracy
and the reduction in number of samples delegated to humans. We perform
experiments on multiple computer vision and medical image datasets for
classification. Our results demonstrate that the proposed loss improves
classification accuracy and delegates less number of decisions to experts,
achieves better out-of-distribution samples detection and on par calibration
performance compared to existing loss functions.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel Learning from Demonstration (LfD) method that
uses neural fields to learn new skills efficiently and accurately. It achieves
this by utilizing a shared embedding to learn both scene and motion
representations in a generative way. Our method smoothly maps each expert
demonstration to a scene-motion embedding and learns to model them without
requiring hand-crafted task parameters or large datasets. It achieves data
efficiency by enforcing scene and motion generation to be smooth with respect
to changes in the embedding space. At inference time, our method can retrieve
scene-motion embeddings using test time optimization, and generate precise
motion trajectories for novel scenes. The proposed method is versatile and can
employ images, 3D shapes, and any other scene representations that can be
modeled using neural fields. Additionally, it can generate both end-effector
positions and joint angle-based trajectories. Our method is evaluated on tasks
that require accurate motion trajectory generation, where the underlying task
parametrization is based on object positions and geometric scene changes.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
baseline approaches and generalizes to novel scenes. Furthermore, in real-world
experiments, we show that our method can successfully model multi-valued
trajectories, it is robust to the distractor objects introduced at inference
time, and it can generate 6D motions.

<p class="mathjax">Minimizing both power fluctuations and energy waste in an electrical grid is
a central challenge to energy policy. Any discrepancy between power production
and loads may lead to inefficiencies and instability in the system. While
sensors and predictive models, which are based on historical data, have been
implemented to make the grid more responsive to instabilities, they have
difficulty addressing fluctuations in real time. Here we explore a model of an
electrical grid which delivers discrete energy to the nodes and is supported by
short-term energy storage units (STESU). The model is analyzed within the
framework of randomly perturbed Markovian chain. We show that under reasonable
assumptions the averaged energy in the grid maintains stability under randomly
fluctuating energy conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Hypergraph visualization has many applications in network data analysis.
Recently, a polygon-based representation for hypergraphs has been proposed with
demonstrated benefits. However, the polygon-based layout often suffers from
excessive self-intersections when the input dataset is relatively large. In
this paper, we propose a framework in which the hypergraph is iteratively
simplified through a set of atomic operations. Then, the layout of the simplest
hypergraph is optimized and used as the foundation for a reverse process that
brings the simplest hypergraph back to the original one, but with an improved
layout. At the core of our approach is the set of atomic simplification
operations and an operation priority measure to guide the simplification
process. In addition, we introduce necessary definitions and conditions for
hypergraph planarity within the polygon representation. We extend our approach
to handle simultaneous simplification and layout optimization for both the
hypergraph and its dual. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with
datasets from a number of real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">We present RadGraph2, a novel dataset for extracting information from
radiology reports that focuses on capturing changes in disease state and device
placement over time. We introduce a hierarchical schema that organizes entities
based on their relationships and show that using this hierarchy during training
improves the performance of an information extraction model. Specifically, we
propose a modification to the DyGIE++ framework, resulting in our model HGIE,
which outperforms previous models in entity and relation extraction tasks. We
demonstrate that RadGraph2 enables models to capture a wider variety of
findings and perform better at relation extraction compared to those trained on
the original RadGraph dataset. Our work provides the foundation for developing
automated systems that can track disease progression over time and develop
information extraction models that leverage the natural hierarchy of labels in
the medical domain.

<p class="mathjax">We present PAT, a transformer-based network that learns complex temporal
co-occurrence action dependencies in a video by exploiting multi-scale temporal
features. In existing methods, the self-attention mechanism in transformers
loses the temporal positional information, which is essential for robust action
detection. To address this issue, we (i) embed relative positional encoding in
the self-attention mechanism and (ii) exploit multi-scale temporal
relationships by designing a novel non hierarchical network, in contrast to the
recent transformer-based approaches that use a hierarchical structure. We argue
that joining the self-attention mechanism with multiple sub-sampling processes
in the hierarchical approaches results in increased loss of positional
information. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on two
challenging dense multi-label benchmark datasets, and show that PAT improves
the current state-of-the-art result by 1.1% and 0.6% mAP on the Charades and
MultiTHUMOS datasets, respectively, thereby achieving the new state-of-the-art
mAP at 26.5% and 44.6%, respectively. We also perform extensive ablation
studies to examine the impact of the different components of our proposed
network.

<p class="mathjax">As traditional cellular base stations (BSs) are optimized for 2D ground
service, providing 3D connectivity to uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires
re-engineering of the existing infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a new
methodology for designing cellular networks that cater for both ground users
and UAV corridors based on Bayesian optimization. We present a case study in
which we maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for both
populations of users by optimizing the electrical antenna tilts and the
transmit power employed at each BS. Our proposed optimized network
significantly boosts the UAV performance, with a 23.4dB gain in mean SINR
compared to an all-downtilt, full-power baseline. At the same time, this
optimal tradeoff nearly preserves the performance on the ground, even attaining
a gain of 1.3dB in mean SINR with respect to said baseline. Thanks to its
ability to optimize black-box stochastic functions, the proposed framework is
amenable to maximize any desired function of the SINR or even the capacity per
area.

<p class="mathjax">The low earth orbit (LEO) satellite network is undergoing rapid development
with the maturing of satellite communications and rocket launch technologies,
and the demand for a global coverage network. However, current satellite
communication networks are constrained by limited transmitting signal power,
resulting in the use of large-size and energy-consuming ground terminals to
provide additional gain. This paper proposes a novel technology called
distributed beamforming to address such challenges and support direct
communications from LEO satellites to smartphones. The proposed distributed
beamforming technique is based on the superposition of electromagnetic (EM)
waves and aims to enhance the received signal strength. Furthermore, we utilize
EM wave superposition to increase the link budget and provide the coverage
pattern formed by the distributed antenna array, which will be affected by the
array structure and the transmitter parameters. In addition, the impact of
Doppler frequency shift and time misalignment on the performance of distributed
beamforming is investigated. Numerical results show that the enhancement of the
received power depends on the angle formed by those radiated beams and can be
up to the square of the number of beams; namely, a maximum enhancement of 6 dB
could be obtained by using two satellites and a maximum of 12 dB increase
through four satellites, which provide a clear guideline for the design of
distributed beamforming for future satellite communications.

<p class="mathjax">The SZZ algorithm is used to connect bug-fixing commits to the earlier
commits that introduced bugs. This algorithm has many applications and many
variants have been devised. However, there are some types of commits that
cannot be traced by the SZZ algorithm, referred to as "ghost commits". The
evaluation of how these ghost commits impact the SZZ algorithm remains limited.
Moreover, these algorithms have been evaluated on datasets created by software
engineering researchers from information in bug trackers and version controlled
histories. Since Oct 2013, the Linux kernel developers have started labelling
bug-fixing patches with the commit identifiers of the corresponding
bug-inducing commit(s) as a standard practice. As of v6.1-rc5, 76,046 pairs of
bug-fixing patches and bug-inducing commits are available. This provides a
unique opportunity to evaluate the SZZ algorithm on a large dataset that has
been created and reviewed by project developers, entirely independently of the
biases of software engineering researchers.
<br />In this paper, we apply six SZZ algorithms to 76,046 pairs of bug-fixing
patches and bug-introducing commits from the Linux kernel. Our findings reveal
that SZZ algorithms experience a more significant decline in recall on our
dataset (13.8%) as compared to prior findings reported by Rosa et al., and the
disparities between the individual SZZ algorithms diminish. Moreover, we find
that 17.47% of bug-fixing commits are ghost commits. Finally, we propose
Tracing-Commit SZZ (TC-SZZ), that traces all commits in the change history of
lines modified or deleted in bug-fixing commits. Applying TC-SZZ to all failure
cases, excluding ghost commits, we found that TC-SZZ could identify 17.7% of
them. Our further analysis found that 34.6% of bug-inducing commits were in the
function history, 27.5% in the file history (but not in the function history),

<p class="mathjax">In the growing domain of scientific machine learning, in-context operator
learning has demonstrated notable potential in learning operators from prompted
data during inference stage without weight updates. However, the current
model's overdependence on sensor data, may inadvertently overlook the
invaluable human insight into the operator. To address this, we present a
transformation of in-context operator learning into a multi-modal paradigm. We
propose the use of "captions" to integrate human knowledge about the operator,
expressed through natural language descriptions and equations. We illustrate
how this method not only broadens the flexibility and generality of
physics-informed learning, but also significantly boosts learning performance
and reduces data needs. Furthermore, we introduce a more efficient neural
network architecture for multi-modal in-context operator learning, referred to
as "ICON-LM", based on a language-model-like architecture. We demonstrate the
viability of "ICON-LM" for scientific machine learning tasks, which creates a
new path for the application of language models.

<p class="mathjax">Solver competitions play a prominent role in assessing and advancing the
state of the art for solving many problems in AI and beyond. Notably, in many
areas of AI, competitions have had substantial impact in guiding research and
applications for many years, and for a solver to be ranked highly in a
competition carries considerable weight. But to which extent can we expect
competition results to generalise to sets of problem instances different from
those used in a particular competition? This is the question we investigate
here, using statistical resampling techniques. We show that the rankings
resulting from the standard interpretation of competition results can be very
sensitive to even minor changes in the benchmark instance set used as the basis
for assessment and can therefore not be expected to carry over to other samples
from the same underlying instance distribution. To address this problem, we
introduce a novel approach to statistically meaningful analysis of competition
results based on resampling performance data. Our approach produces confidence
intervals of competition scores as well as statistically robust solver rankings
with bounded error. Applied to recent SAT, AI planning and computer vision
competitions, our analysis reveals frequent statistical ties in solver
performance as well as some inversions of ranks compared to the official
results based on simple scoring.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents CERMET, an energy-efficient hardware architecture
designed for hardware-constrained cryptosystems. CERMET employs a base
cryptosystem in conjunction with network coding to provide both
information-theoretic and computational security while reducing energy
consumption per bit. This paper introduces the hardware architecture for the
system and explores various optimizations to enhance its performance. The
universality of the approach is demonstrated by designing the architecture to
accommodate both asymmetric and symmetric cryptosystems. The analysis reveals
that the benefits of this proposed approach are multifold, reducing energy per
bit and area without compromising security or throughput. The optimized
hardware architectures can achieve below 1 pJ/bit operations for AES-256.
Furthermore, for a public key cryptosystem based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography
(ECC), a remarkable 14.6X reduction in energy per bit and a 9.3X reduction in
area are observed, bringing it to less than 1 nJ/bit.

<p class="mathjax">The classical ski-rental problem admits a textbook 2-competitive
deterministic algorithm, and a simple randomized algorithm that is
$\frac{e}{e-1}$-competitive in expectation. The randomized algorithm, while
optimal in expectation, has a large variance in its performance: it has more
than a 37% chance of competitive ratio exceeding 2, and a $\Theta(1/n)$ chance
of the competitive ratio exceeding $n$!
<br />We ask what happens to the optimal solution if we insist that the tail risk,
i.e., the chance of the competitive ratio exceeding a specific value, is
bounded by some constant $\delta$. We find that this additional modification
significantly changes the structure of the optimal solution. The probability of
purchasing skis on a given day becomes non-monotone, discontinuous, and
arbitrarily large (for sufficiently small tail risk $\delta$ and large purchase

ink on the Herculaneum papyri collection. This collection consists of
carbonized scrolls and fragments of documents, which have been digitized via

<p class="mathjax">Offline Reinforcement learning is commonly used for sequential
decision-making in domains such as healthcare and education, where the rewards
are known and the transition dynamics $T$ must be estimated on the basis of
batch data. A key challenge for all tasks is how to learn a reliable estimate
of the transition dynamics $T$ that produce near-optimal policies that are safe
enough so that they never take actions that are far away from the best action
with respect to their value functions and informative enough so that they
communicate the uncertainties they have. Using data from an expert, we propose
a new constraint-based approach that captures our desiderata for reliably
learning a posterior distribution of the transition dynamics $T$ that is free
from gradients. Our results demonstrate that by using our constraints, we learn
a high-performing policy, while considerably reducing the policy's variance
over different datasets. We also explain how combining uncertainty estimation
with these constraints can help us infer a partial ranking of actions that
produce higher returns, and helps us infer safer and more informative policies
for planning.

<p class="mathjax">During our port of the MicroPython bytecode interpreter to the CHERI-based
Arm Morello platform, we encountered a number of serious performance
degradations. This paper explores several of these of these performance issues
in detail, in each case characterizing the cause of the problem, the fix, and
the corresponding performance improvement over a set of standard Python
benchmarks.
<br />While we recognize that Morello is a prototypical physical instantiation of
the CHERI concept, we show that it is possible to eliminate certain kinds of
software-induced runtime overhead that occur due to the larger size of
architectural capabilities relative to native pointers. In our case, we reduce
a geometric mean benchmark slowdown from 5x (before optimization) to 2x (after
optimization) relative to AArch64 execution. The worst-case slowdowns are
greatly improved, from 100x (before optimization) to 2x (after optimization).
<br />The key insight is that pointer size assumptions pervade systems code;
whereas previous CHERI porting projects highlighted compile-time and
execution-time errors exposed by pointer size assumptions, we instead focus on
the performance implications of such assumptions.

<p class="mathjax">In a mobile wireless channel, the small-scale multipath fading induces
temporal channel fluctuations in the form of peaks and deep fades. The channel
capacity degradation with fading severity in the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime is well known in the wireless communication literature: the
probability of deep fades increases significantly with higher fading severity
resulting in poor performance. In this paper, we focus on double-fading pinhole
channels under perfect CSIT to show a very counter-intuitive result that -
higher fading severity enables higher ergodic capacity at sufficiently low SNR.
The underlying reason is that at low SNRs, ergodic capacity depends crucially
on the probability distribution of channel peaks (simply tail distribution);
for the pinhole channel, the tail distribution improves with increased fading
severity. This allows a transmitter operating at low SNR to exploit channel
peaks more efficiently resulting in a net improvement in achievable spectral
efficiency. We derive a new key result quantifying the above dependence for the
double-Nakagami-$m$ fading pinhole channel - that is, the ergodic capacity ${C}
\propto (m_T m_R)^{-1}$ at low SNR, where $m_T m_R$ is the product of fading
(severity) parameters of the two independent Nakagami-$m$ fadings involved.

<p class="mathjax">Video Semantic Role Labeling (VidSRL) aims to detect the salient events from
given videos, by recognizing the predict-argument event structures and the
interrelationships between events. While recent endeavors have put forth
methods for VidSRL, they can be mostly subject to two key drawbacks, including
the lack of fine-grained spatial scene perception and the insufficiently
modeling of video temporality. Towards this end, this work explores a novel
holistic spatio-temporal scene graph (namely HostSG) representation based on
the existing dynamic scene graph structures, which well model both the
fine-grained spatial semantics and temporal dynamics of videos for VidSRL.
Built upon the HostSG, we present a nichetargeting VidSRL framework. A
scene-event mapping mechanism is first designed to bridge the gap between the
underlying scene structure and the high-level event semantic structure,
resulting in an overall hierarchical scene-event (termed ICE) graph structure.
We further perform iterative structure refinement to optimize the ICE graph,
such that the overall structure representation can best coincide with end task
demand. Finally, three subtask predictions of VidSRL are jointly decoded, where
the end-to-end paradigm effectively avoids error propagation. On the benchmark
dataset, our framework boosts significantly over the current best-performing
model. Further analyses are shown for a better understanding of the advances of
our methods.

<p class="mathjax">We show how to learn discrete field theories from observational data of
fields on a space-time lattice. For this, we train a neural network model of a
discrete Lagrangian density such that the discrete Euler--Lagrange equations
are consistent with the given training data. We, thus, obtain a
structure-preserving machine learning architecture. Lagrangian densities are
not uniquely defined by the solutions of a field theory. We introduce a
technique to derive regularisers for the training process which optimise
numerical regularity of the discrete field theory. Minimisation of the
regularisers guarantees that close to the training data the discrete field
theory behaves robust and efficient when used in numerical simulations.
Further, we show how to identify structurally simple solutions of the
underlying continuous field theory such as travelling waves. This is possible
even when travelling waves are not present in the training data. This is
compared to data-driven model order reduction based approaches, which struggle
to identify suitable latent spaces containing structurally simple solutions
when these are not present in the training data. Ideas are demonstrated on
examples based on the wave equation and the Schr\"odinger equation.

<p class="mathjax">The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many employees to work from home.
Organizational bulk emails now play a critical role to reach employees with
central information in this work-from-home environment. However, we know from
our own recent work that organizational bulk email has problems: recipients
fail to retain the bulk messages they received from the organization;
recipients and senders have different opinions on which bulk messages were
important; and communicators lack technology support to better target and
design messages. In this position paper, first we review the prior work on
evaluating, designing, and prototyping organizational communication systems.
Second we review our recent findings and some research techniques we found
useful in studying organizational communication. Last we propose a research
agenda to study organizational communications in remote work environment and
suggest some key questions and potential study directions.

<p class="mathjax">The purpose of the research is to determine if currently available
self-supervised learning techniques can accomplish human level comprehension of
visual images using the same degree and amount of sensory input that people
acquire from. Initial research on this topic solely considered data volume
scaling. Here, we scale both the volume of data and the quality of the image.
This scaling experiment is a self-supervised learning method that may be done
without any outside financing. We find that scaling up data volume and picture
resolution at the same time enables human-level item detection performance at
sub-human sizes.We run a scaling experiment with vision transformers trained on
up to 200000 images up to 256 ppi.

<p class="mathjax">In the text-to-image generation field, recent remarkable progress in Stable
Diffusion makes it possible to generate rich kinds of novel photorealistic
images. However, current models still face misalignment issues (e.g.,
problematic spatial relation understanding and numeration failure) in complex
natural scenes, which impedes the high-faithfulness text-to-image generation.
Although recent efforts have been made to improve controllability by giving
fine-grained guidance (e.g., sketch and scribbles), this issue has not been
fundamentally tackled since users have to provide such guidance information
manually. In this work, we strive to synthesize high-fidelity images that are
semantically aligned with a given textual prompt without any guidance. Toward
this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine paradigm to achieve layout planning and
image generation. Concretely, we first generate the coarse-grained layout
conditioned on a given textual prompt via in-context learning based on Large
Language Models. Afterward, we propose a fine-grained object-interaction
diffusion method to synthesize high-faithfulness images conditioned on the
prompt and the automatically generated layout. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models in
terms of layout and image generation. Our code and settings are available at

<p class="mathjax">Classic BFT consensus protocols guarantee safety and liveness for all clients
if fewer than one-third of replicas are faulty. However, in applications such
as high-value payments, some clients may want to prioritize safety over
liveness. Flexible consensus allows each client to opt for a higher safety
resilience, albeit at the expense of reduced liveness resilience. We present
the first construction that allows optimal safety--liveness tradeoff for every
client simultaneously. This construction is modular and is realized as an
add-on applied on top of an existing consensus protocol. The add-on consists of
an additional round of voting and permanent locking done by the replicas, to
sidestep a sub-optimal quorum-intersection-based constraint present in previous
solutions. We adapt our construction to the existing Ethereum protocol to
derive optimal flexible confirmation rules that clients can adopt unilaterally
without requiring system-wide changes. This is possible because existing
Ethereum protocol features can double as the extra voting and locking. We
demonstrate an implementation using Ethereum's consensus API.

<p class="mathjax">The enormous demand for annotated data brought forth by deep learning
techniques has been accompanied by the problem of annotation noise. Although
this issue has been widely discussed in machine learning literature, it has
been relatively unexplored in the context of "multi-label classification" (MLC)
tasks which feature more complicated kinds of noise. Additionally, when the
domain in question has certain logical constraints, noisy annotations often
exacerbate their violations, making such a system unacceptable to an expert.
This paper studies the effect of label noise on domain rule violation incidents
in the MLC task, and incorporates domain rules into our learning algorithm to
mitigate the effect of noise. We propose the Domain Obedient Self-supervised
Training (DOST) paradigm which not only makes deep learning models more aligned
to domain rules, but also improves learning performance in key metrics and
minimizes the effect of annotation noise. This novel approach uses domain
guidance to detect offending annotations and deter rule-violating predictions
in a self-supervised manner, thus making it more "data efficient" and domain
compliant. Empirical studies, performed over two large scale multi-label
classification datasets, demonstrate that our method results in improvement
across the board, and often entirely counteracts the effect of noise.

<p class="mathjax">Existing methods for interactive segmentation in radiance fields entail
scene-specific optimization and thus cannot generalize across different scenes,
which greatly limits their applicability. In this work we make the first
attempt at Scene-Generalizable Interactive Segmentation in Radiance Fields
(SGISRF) and propose a novel SGISRF method, which can perform 3D object
segmentation for novel (unseen) scenes represented by radiance fields, guided
by only a few interactive user clicks in a given set of multi-view 2D images.
In particular, the proposed SGISRF focuses on addressing three crucial
challenges with three specially designed techniques. First, we devise the
Cross-Dimension Guidance Propagation to encode the scarce 2D user clicks into
informative 3D guidance representations. Second, the Uncertainty-Eliminated 3D
Segmentation module is designed to achieve efficient yet effective 3D
segmentation. Third, Concealment-Revealed Supervised Learning scheme is
proposed to reveal and correct the concealed 3D segmentation errors resulted
from the supervision in 2D space with only 2D mask annotations. Extensive
experiments on two real-world challenging benchmarks covering diverse scenes
demonstrate 1) effectiveness and scene-generalizability of the proposed method,
2) favorable performance compared to classical method requiring scene-specific
optimization.

<p class="mathjax">The decline in ecological connections signifies the potential extinction of
species, which can be attributed to disruptions and alterations. The decrease
in interconnections among species reflects their susceptibility to changes. For
example, certain insects and plants that rely on exclusive interactions with a
limited number of species, or even a specific species, face the risk of
extinction if they lose these crucial connections. Currently, mining activities
pose significant harm to natural ecosystems, resulting in various adverse
environmental impacts. In this study, we utilized network science techniques to
analyze the ecosystem in a graph-based structure, aiming to conserve the
ecosystem affected by mining operations in the northern region of Scotland. The
research encompasses identifying the most vital members of the network,
establishing criteria for identifying communities within the network,
comparing, and evaluating them, using models to predict secondary extinctions
that occur when a species is removed from the network, and assessing the extent
of network damage. Our study's novelty is utilizing network science approaches
to investigate the biological data related to interactions between insects and
plants.

<p class="mathjax">In the modern financial industry system, the structure of products has become
more and more complex, and the bottleneck constraint of classical computing
power has already restricted the development of the financial industry. Here,
we present a photonic chip that implements the unary approach to European
option pricing, in combination with the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm,
to achieve a quadratic speedup compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. The
circuit consists of three modules: a module loading the distribution of asset
prices, a module computing the expected payoff, and a module performing the
quantum amplitude estimation algorithm to introduce speed-ups. In the
distribution module, a generative adversarial network is embedded for efficient
learning and loading of asset distributions, which precisely capture the market
trends. This work is a step forward in the development of specialized photonic
processors for applications in finance, with the potential to improve the
efficiency and quality of financial services.

<p class="mathjax">Arctic amplification has altered the climate patterns both regionally and
globally, resulting in more frequent and more intense extreme weather events in
the past few decades. The essential part of Arctic amplification is the
unprecedented sea ice loss as demonstrated by satellite observations.
Accurately forecasting Arctic sea ice from sub-seasonal to seasonal scales has
been a major research question with fundamental challenges at play. In addition
to physics-based Earth system models, researchers have been applying multiple
statistical and machine learning models for sea ice forecasting. Looking at the
potential of data-driven approaches to study sea ice variations, we propose
MT-IceNet - a UNet based spatial and multi-temporal (MT) deep learning model
for forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC). The model uses an
encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections and processes multi-temporal
input streams to regenerate spatial maps at future timesteps. Using bi-monthly
and monthly satellite retrieved sea ice data from NSIDC as well as atmospheric
and oceanic variables from ERA5 reanalysis product during 1979-2021, we show
that our proposed model provides promising predictive performance for per-pixel
SIC forecasting with up to 60% decrease in prediction error for a lead time of
6 months as compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Classical multi-sorted equational theories and their free algebras have been
fundamental in mathematics and computer science. In this paper, we present a
generalization of multi-sorted equational theories from the classical
($Set$-enriched) context to the context of enrichment in a symmetric monoidal
category $V$ that is topological over $Set$. Prominent examples of such
categories include: various categories of topological and measurable spaces;
the categories of models of relational Horn theories without equality,
including the categories of preordered sets and (extended) pseudo-metric
spaces; and the categories of quasispaces (a.k.a. concrete sheaves) on concrete
sites, which have recently attracted interest in the study of programming
language semantics.
<br />Given such a category $V$, we define a notion of $V$-enriched multi-sorted
equational theory. We show that every $V$-enriched multi-sorted equational
theory $T$ has an underlying classical multi-sorted equational theory $|T|$,
and that free $T$-algebras may be obtained as suitable liftings of free
$|T|$-algebras. We establish explicit and concrete descriptions of free
$T$-algebras, which have a convenient inductive character when $V$ is cartesian
closed. We provide several examples of $V$-enriched multi-sorted equational
theories, and we also discuss the close connection between these theories and
the presentations of $V$-enriched algebraic theories and monads studied in
recent papers by the author and Lucyshyn-Wright.

<p class="mathjax">Noisy labels hurt deep learning-based supervised image classification
performance as the models may overfit the noise and learn corrupted feature
extractors. For natural image classification training with noisy labeled data,
model initialization with contrastive self-supervised pretrained weights has
shown to reduce feature corruption and improve classification performance.
However, no works have explored: i) how other self-supervised approaches, such
as pretext task-based pretraining, impact the learning with noisy label, and
ii) any self-supervised pretraining methods alone for medical images in noisy
label settings. Medical images often feature smaller datasets and subtle inter
class variations, requiring human expertise to ensure correct classification.
Thus, it is not clear if the methods improving learning with noisy labels in
natural image datasets such as CIFAR would also help with medical images. In
this work, we explore contrastive and pretext task-based self-supervised
pretraining to initialize the weights of a deep learning classification model
for two medical datasets with self-induced noisy labels -- NCT-CRC-HE-100K
tissue histological images and COVID-QU-Ex chest X-ray images. Our results show
that models initialized with pretrained weights obtained from self-supervised
learning can effectively learn better features and improve robustness against
noisy labels.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of causal effect estimation with an unobserved
confounder, where we observe a proxy variable that is associated with the
confounder. Although Proxy Causal Learning (PCL) uses two proxy variables to
recover the true causal effect, we show that a single proxy variable is
sufficient for causal estimation if the outcome is generated deterministically,
generalizing Control Outcome Calibration Approach (COCA). We propose two
kernel-based methods for this setting: the first based on the two-stage
regression approach, and the second based on a maximum moment restriction
approach. We prove that both approaches can consistently estimate the causal
effect, and we empirically demonstrate that we can successfully recover the
causal effect on a synthetic dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Although many deep-learning-based super-resolution approaches have been
proposed in recent years, because no ground truth is available in the inference
stage, few can quantify the errors and uncertainties of the super-resolved
results. For scientific visualization applications, however, conveying
uncertainties of the results to scientists is crucial to avoid generating
misleading or incorrect information. In this paper, we propose PSRFlow, a novel
normalizing flow-based generative model for scientific data super-resolution
that incorporates uncertainty quantification into the super-resolution process.
PSRFlow learns the conditional distribution of the high-resolution data based
on the low-resolution counterpart. By sampling from a Gaussian latent space
that captures the missing information in the high-resolution data, one can
generate different plausible super-resolution outputs. The efficient sampling
in the Gaussian latent space allows our model to perform uncertainty
quantification for the super-resolved results. During model training, we
augment the training data with samples across various scales to make the model
adaptable to data of different scales, achieving flexible super-resolution for
a given input. Our results demonstrate superior performance and robust
uncertainty quantification compared with existing methods such as interpolation
and GAN-based super-resolution networks.

<p class="mathjax">This research investigates the influence of distant encounters between an
asteroid and perturbing bodies on the deflection process, aiming to provide
valuable guidelines for the trajectory design of a deflecting spacecraft.
Analytical approximations are commonly used in the preliminary design phase to
quickly explore a large design space. However, the dynamics involved in
asteroid deflection are intricate, and simple models may not capture the full
complexity of the system. We examine the accuracy and limitations of analytical
models compared to more accurate numerical simulations. The study reveals that
encounters with perturbing bodies, even at considerable distances (of dozens of
radii of the sphere of influence), can significantly perturb the asteroid's
trajectory, leading to discrepancies between analytical and numerical
predictions. To address this, we propose a heuristic rule to guide trajectory
designers in determining the suitability of analytical models for specific
deflection scenarios. By understanding the impact of distant encounters on
deflection, our study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed
decisions during the trajectory planning process, facilitating efficient and
effective asteroid deflection missions.

<p class="mathjax">In the past few years, deep learning (DL) techniques have been introduced for
designing sparse arrays. These methods offer the advantages of feature
engineering and low prediction-stage complexity, which is helpful in tackling
the combinatorial search inherent to finding a sparse array. In this chapter,
we provide a synopsis of several direction finding applications of DL-based
sparse arrays. We begin by examining supervised and transfer learning
techniques that have applications in selecting sparse arrays for a cognitive
radar application. Here, we also discuss the use of meta-heuristic learning
algorithms such as simulated annealing for the case of designing
two-dimensional sparse arrays. Next, we consider DL-based antenna selection for
wireless communications, wherein sparse array problem may also be combined with
channel estimation, beamforming, or localization. Finally, we provide an
example of deep sparse array technique for integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) application, wherein a trade-off of radar and
communications performance makes ISAC sparse array problem very challenging.
For each setting, we illustrate the performance of model-based optimization and
DL techniques through several numerical experiments. We discuss additional
considerations required to ensure robustness of DL-based algorithms against
various imperfections in array data.

<p class="mathjax">This research paper presents a novel approach to enhance optimization
performance through the hybridization of Gaussian Crunching Search (GCS) and
Powell's Method for derivative-free optimization. While GCS has shown promise
in overcoming challenges faced by traditional derivative-free optimization
methods [1], it may not always excel in finding the local minimum. On the other
hand, some traditional methods may have better performance in this regard.
However, GCS demonstrates its strength in escaping the trap of local minima and
approaching the global minima. Through experimentation, we discovered that by
combining GCS with certain traditional derivative-free optimization methods, we
can significantly boost performance while retaining the respective advantages
of each method. This hybrid approach opens up new possibilities for optimizing
complex systems and finding optimal solutions in a range of applications.

and quantification of uncertainty in prostate segmentation from MRI images. The
aim is to improve the workflow of prostate cancer detection and diagnosis.
Seven different U-Net-based architectures, augmented with Monte-Carlo dropout,
are evaluated for automatic segmentation of the central zone, peripheral zone,
transition zone, and tumor, with uncertainty estimation. The top-performing
model in this study is the Attention R2U-Net, achieving a mean Intersection
over Union (IoU) of 76.3% and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85% for

making it an ideal tool for representing complex relationships in network
science. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in studies on
hypernetworks, however, the comparison of the difference between two

hyper-distance-based method (HD) for comparing hypernetworks. This method takes
into account high-order information, such as the high-order distance between
nodes. The experiments carried out on synthetic hypernetworks have shown that
HD is capable of distinguishing between hypernetworks generated with different

Furthermore, HD outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines to distinguish
empirical hypernetworks when hyperedges are disrupted.

<p class="mathjax">The accurate diagnosis on pathological subtypes for lung cancer is of
significant importance for the follow-up treatments and prognosis managements.
In this paper, we propose self-generating hybrid feature network (SGHF-Net) for
accurately classifying lung cancer subtypes on computed tomography (CT) images.
Inspired by studies stating that cross-scale associations exist in the image
patterns between the same case's CT images and its pathological images, we
innovatively developed a pathological feature synthetic module (PFSM), which
quantitatively maps cross-modality associations through deep neural networks,
to derive the "gold standard" information contained in the corresponding
pathological images from CT images. Additionally, we designed a radiological
feature extraction module (RFEM) to directly acquire CT image information and
integrated it with the pathological priors under an effective feature fusion
framework, enabling the entire classification model to generate more indicative
and specific pathologically related features and eventually output more
accurate predictions. The superiority of the proposed model lies in its ability
to self-generate hybrid features that contain multi-modality image information
based on a single-modality input. To evaluate the effectiveness, adaptability,
and generalization ability of our model, we performed extensive experiments on
a large-scale multi-center dataset (i.e., 829 cases from three hospitals) to
compare our model and a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification
models. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our model for
lung cancer subtypes classification with significant accuracy improvements in
terms of accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), and F1 score.

<p class="mathjax">Utilizing optical fibers to detect and pinpoint vibrations, Distributed
Optical Fiber Vibration Sensing (DVS) technology provides real-time monitoring
and surveillance of wide-reaching areas. This field has been leveraging
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Recently, a study has accomplished
end-to-end vibration event recognition, enabling utilization of CNN-based DVS
algorithms as real-time embedded system for edge computing in practical
application situations. Considering the power consumption of central processing
unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU), and the inflexibility of
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field-Programmable gate array
(FPGA) is the optimal computing platform for the system. This paper proposes to
compress pre-trained network and adopt a novel hardware structure, to design a
fully on-chip, pipelined inference accelerator for CNN-based DVS algorithm,
without fine tuning or re-training. This design allows for real-time processing
with low power consumption and system requirement.An examination has been
executed on an existing DVS algorithm based on a 40-layer CNN model comprising
2.7 million parameters. It is completely implemented on-chip, pipelined, with
no reduction in accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">StorSeismic is a recently introduced model based on the Transformer to adapt
to various seismic processing tasks through its pretraining and fine-tuning
training strategy. In the original implementation, StorSeismic utilized a
sinusoidal positional encoding and a conventional self-attention mechanism,
both borrowed from the natural language processing (NLP) applications. For
seismic processing they admitted good results, but also hinted to limitations
in efficiency and expressiveness. We propose modifications to these two key
components, by utilizing relative positional encoding and low-rank attention
matrices as replacements to the vanilla ones. The proposed changes are tested
on processing tasks applied to a realistic Marmousi and offshore field data as
a sequential strategy, starting from denoising, direct arrival removal,
multiple attenuation, and finally root-mean-squared velocity ($V_{RMS}$)
prediction for normal moveout (NMO) correction. We observe faster pretraining
and competitive results on the fine-tuning tasks and, additionally, fewer
parameters to train compared to the vanilla model.

<p class="mathjax">Parallel imaging, a fast MRI technique, involves dynamic adjustments based on
the configuration i.e. number, positioning, and sensitivity of the coils with
respect to the anatomy under study. Conventional deep learning-based image
reconstruction models have to be trained or fine-tuned for each configuration,
posing a barrier to clinical translation, given the lack of computational
resources and machine learning expertise for clinicians to train models at
deployment. Joint training on diverse datasets learns a single weight set that
might underfit to deviated configurations. We propose, HyperCoil-Recon, a
hypernetwork-based coil configuration task-switching network for multi-coil MRI
reconstruction that encodes varying configurations of the numbers of coils in a
multi-tasking perspective, posing each configuration as a task. The
hypernetworks infer and embed task-specific weights into the reconstruction
network, 1) effectively utilizing the contextual knowledge of common and
varying image features among the various fields-of-view of the coils, and 2)
enabling generality to unseen configurations at test time. Experiments reveal
that our approach 1) adapts on the fly to various unseen configurations up to
32 coils when trained on lower numbers (i.e. 7 to 11) of randomly varying
coils, and to 120 deviated unseen configurations when trained on 18
configurations in a single model, 2) matches the performance of coil
configuration-specific models, and 3) outperforms configuration-invariant
models with improvement margins of around 1 dB / 0.03 and 0.3 dB / 0.02 in PSNR
/ SSIM for knee and brain data. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">The design of personalized cranial implants is a challenging and tremendous
task that has become a hot topic in terms of process automation with the use of
deep learning techniques. The main challenge is associated with the high
diversity of possible cranial defects. The lack of appropriate data sources
negatively influences the data-driven nature of deep learning algorithms.
Hence, one of the possible solutions to overcome this problem is to rely on
synthetic data. In this work, we propose three volumetric variations of deep
generative models to augment the dataset by generating synthetic skulls, i.e.
Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP),
WGAN-GP hybrid with Variational Autoencoder pretraining (VAE/WGAN-GP) and
Introspective Variational Autoencoder (IntroVAE). We show that it is possible
to generate dozens of thousands of defective skulls with compatible defects
that achieve a trade-off between defect heterogeneity and the realistic shape
of the skull. We evaluate obtained synthetic data quantitatively by defect
segmentation with the use of V-Net and qualitatively by their latent space
exploration. We show that the synthetically generated skulls highly improve the
segmentation process compared to using only the original unaugmented data. The
generated skulls may improve the automatic design of personalized cranial
implants for real medical cases.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we analyze the relation between reparametrizations of gradient
flow and the induced implicit bias on general linear models, which encompass
various basic classification and regression tasks. In particular, we aim at
understanding the influence of the model parameters - reparametrization, loss,
and link function - on the convergence behavior of gradient flow. Our results
provide user-friendly conditions under which the implicit bias can be
well-described and convergence of the flow is guaranteed. We furthermore show
how to use these insights for designing reparametrization functions that lead
to specific implicit biases like $\ell_p$- or trigonometric regularizers.

<p class="mathjax">Functionally significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused by plaque
buildup in the coronary arteries, potentially leading to narrowing of the
arterial lumen, i.e. coronary stenosis, that significantly obstructs blood flow
to the myocardium. The current reference for establishing the presence of a
functionally significant stenosis is invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR)
measurement. To avoid invasive measurements, non-invasive prediction of FFR
from coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has emerged. For this, machine learning
approaches, characterized by fast inference, are increasingly developed.
However, these methods predict a single FFR value per artery i.e. they don't
provide information about the stenosis location or treatment strategy. We
propose a deep learning-based method to predict the FFR along the artery from
CCTA scans. This study includes CCTA images of 110 patients who underwent
invasive FFR pullback measurement in 112 arteries. First, a multi planar
reconstruction (MPR) of the artery is fed to a variational autoencoder to
characterize the artery, i.e. through the lumen area and unsupervised artery
encodings. Thereafter, a convolutional neural network (CNN) predicts the FFR
along the artery. The CNN is supervised by multiple loss functions, notably a
loss function inspired by the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to predict the
correct location of FFR drops and a histogram-based loss to explicitly
supervise the slope of the FFR curve. To train and evaluate our model,
eight-fold cross-validation was performed. The resulting FFR curves show good
agreement with the reference allowing the distinction between diffuse and focal
CAD distributions in most cases. Quantitative evaluation yielded a mean
absolute difference in the area under the FFR pullback curve (AUPC) of 1.7. The
method may pave the way towards fast, accurate, automatic prediction of FFR
along the artery from CCTA.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel computational model employing hierarchical active
inference to simulate reading and eye movements. The model characterizes
linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model,
facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from
syllables to sentences.
<br />Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic
textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to
informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model
exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences,
adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual-route
theories of reading. Notably, our model permits the exploration of maladaptive
inference effects on eye movements during reading, such as in dyslexia. To
simulate this condition, we attenuate the contribution of priors during the
reading process, leading to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading
style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades. This alignment
with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals
highlights the model's potential to aid in understanding the cognitive
processes underlying reading and eye movements, as well as how reading deficits
associated with dyslexia may emerge from maladaptive predictive processing.
<br />In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending
the intricate cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with
potential implications for understanding and addressing dyslexia through the
simulation of maladaptive inference. It may offer valuable insights into this
condition and contribute to the development of more effective interventions for
treatment.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting stock prices presents a challenging research problem due to the
inherent volatility and non-linear nature of the stock market. In recent years,
knowledge-enhanced stock price prediction methods have shown groundbreaking
results by utilizing external knowledge to understand the stock market. Despite
the importance of these methods, there is a scarcity of scholarly works that
systematically synthesize previous studies from the perspective of external
knowledge types. Specifically, the external knowledge can be modeled in
different data structures, which we group into non-graph-based formats and
graph-based formats: 1) non-graph-based knowledge captures contextual
information and multimedia descriptions specifically associated with an
individual stock; 2) graph-based knowledge captures interconnected and
interdependent information in the stock market. This survey paper aims to
provide a systematic and comprehensive description of methods for acquiring
external knowledge from various unstructured data sources and then
incorporating it into stock price prediction models. We also explore fusion
methods for combining external knowledge with historical price features.
Moreover, this paper includes a compilation of relevant datasets and delves
into potential future research directions in this domain.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown poses
(projection angles and image translation) in cryo-EM experiments,
reconstructing 3D structures from 2D images is very challenging. On top of
these challenges, heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction also has an additional
requirement: conformation classification. An emerging solution to this problem
is called amortized inference, implemented using the autoencoder architecture
or its variants. Instead of searching for the correct
image-to-pose/conformation mapping for every image in the dataset as in
non-amortized methods, amortized inference only needs to train an encoder that
maps images to appropriate latent spaces representing poses or conformations.
Unfortunately, standard amortized-inference-based methods with entangled latent
spaces have difficulty learning the distribution of conformations and poses
from cryo-EM images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning
architecture called "ACE-HetEM" based on amortized inference. To explicitly
enforce the disentanglement of conformation classifications and pose
estimations, we designed two alternating training tasks in our method:
image-to-image task and pose-to-pose task. Results on simulated datasets show
that ACE-HetEM has comparable accuracy in pose estimation and produces even
better reconstruction resolution than non-amortized methods. Furthermore, we
show that ACE-HetEM is also applicable to real experimental datasets.

<p class="mathjax">About ten years ago, a paper proposed the first integer linear programming
formulation for the constrained two-dimensional guillotine cutting problem
(with unlimited cutting stages). Since, six other formulations followed, five
of them in the last two years. This spike of interest gave no opportunity for a
comprehensive comparison between the formulations. We review each formulation
and compare their empirical results over instance datasets of the literature.
We adapt most formulations to allow for piece rotation. The possibility of
adaptation was already predicted but not realized by the prior work. The
results show the dominance of pseudo-polynomial formulations until the point
instances become intractable by them, while more compact formulations keep
achieving good primal solutions. Our study also reveals a small but consistent
advantage of the Gurobi solver over the CPLEX solver in our context; that the
choice of solver hardly benefits one formulation over another; and a mistake in
the generation of the T instances, which should have the same optima with or
without guillotine cuts. Our study also proposes hybridising the most recent
formulation with a prior formulation for a restricted version of the problem.
The hybridisations show a reduction of about 20% of the branch-and-bound time
thanks to the symmetries broken by the hybridisation.

been investigated under a more general setting, and two estimators for
estimating the parameters have been proposed. Since both estimators are
obtained iterative fashion, several numerical schemes are investigated and the

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL) models are gaining popularity in forest variable
prediction using Earth Observation images. However, in practical forest
inventories, reference datasets are often represented by plot- or stand-level
measurements, while high-quality representative wall-to-wall reference data for
end-to-end training of DL models are rarely available. Transfer learning
facilitates expansion of the use of deep learning models into areas with
sub-optimal training data by allowing pretraining of the model in areas where
high-quality teaching data are available. In this study, we perform a "model
transfer" (or domain adaptation) of a pretrained DL model into a target area
using plot-level measurements and compare performance versus other machine
learning models. We use an earlier developed UNet based model (SeUNet) to
demonstrate the approach on two distinct taiga sites with varying forest
structure and composition. Multisource Earth Observation (EO) data are
represented by a combination of Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2
multispectral images, JAXA ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 SAR mosaic and TanDEM-X bistatic
interferometric radar data. The training study site is located in Finnish
Lapland, while the target site is located in Southern Finland. By leveraging
transfer learning, the prediction of SeUNet achieved root mean squared error
(RMSE) of 2.70 m and R$^2$ of 0.882, considerably more accurate than
traditional benchmark methods. We expect such forest-specific DL model transfer
can be suitable also for other forest variables and other EO data sources that
are sensitive to forest structure.

for the joint generation of antibody 3D structures and sequences. AbDiffuser is
built on top of a new representation of protein structure, relies on a novel
architecture for aligned proteins, and utilizes strong diffusion priors to
improve the denoising process. Our approach improves protein diffusion by
taking advantage of domain knowledge and physics-based constraints; handles
sequence-length changes; and reduces memory complexity by an order of magnitude
enabling backbone and side chain generation. We validate AbDiffuser in silico

generate antibodies that closely track the sequence and structural properties
of a reference set. Laboratory experiments confirm that all 16 HER2 antibodies

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for collaborative wideband
spectrum sensing and scheduling for networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
which act as the secondary users to opportunistically utilize detected spectrum
holes. To this end, we propose a multi-class classification problem for
wideband spectrum sensing to detect vacant spectrum spots based on collected
I/Q samples. To enhance the accuracy of the spectrum sensing module, the
outputs from the multi-class classification by each individual UAV are fused at
a server in the unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) ecosystem. In
the spectrum scheduling phase, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL)
solutions to dynamically allocate the detected spectrum holes to the secondary
users (i.e., UAVs). To evaluate the proposed methods, we establish a
comprehensive simulation framework that generates a near-realistic synthetic
dataset using MATLAB LTE toolbox by incorporating base-station~(BS) locations
in a chosen area of interest, performing ray-tracing, and emulating the primary
users channel usage in terms of I/Q samples. This evaluation methodology
provides a flexible framework to generate large spectrum datasets that could be
used for developing ML/AI-based spectrum management solutions for aerial
devices.

<p class="mathjax">Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) is a new paradigm for
computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). LASS aims to separate a target
sound from an audio mixture given a natural language query, which provides a
natural and scalable interface for digital audio applications. Recent works on
LASS, despite attaining promising separation performance on specific sources
(e.g., musical instruments, limited classes of audio events), are unable to
separate audio concepts in the open domain. In this work, we introduce
AudioSep, a foundation model for open-domain audio source separation with
natural language queries. We train AudioSep on large-scale multimodal datasets
and extensively evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks including audio
event separation, musical instrument separation, and speech enhancement.
AudioSep demonstrates strong separation performance and impressive zero-shot
generalization ability using audio captions or text labels as queries,
substantially outperforming previous audio-queried and language-queried sound
separation models. For reproducibility of this work, we will release the source
code, evaluation benchmark and pre-trained model at:

<p class="mathjax">Shape morphing that transforms morphologies in response to stimuli is crucial
for future multifunctional systems. While kirigami holds great promise in
enhancing shape-morphing, existing designs primarily focus on kinematics and
overlook the underlying physics. This study introduces a differentiable inverse
design framework that considers the physical interplay between geometry,
materials, and stimuli of active kirigami, made by soft material embedded with
magnetic particles, to realize target shape-morphing upon magnetic excitation.
We achieve this by combining differentiable kinematics and energy models into a
constrained optimization, simultaneously designing the cuts and magnetization
orientations to ensure kinematic and physical feasibility. Complex kirigami
designs are obtained automatically with unparallel efficiency, which can be
remotely controlled to morph into intricate target shapes and even multiple
states. The proposed framework can be extended to accommodate various active
systems, bridging geometry and physics to push the frontiers in shape-morphing
applications, like flexible electronics and minimally invasive surgery.

<p class="mathjax">Many segmentation networks have been proposed for 3D volumetric segmentation
of tumors and organs at risk. Hospitals and clinical institutions seek to
accelerate and minimize the efforts of specialists in image segmentation.
Still, in case of errors generated by these networks, clinicians would have to
manually edit the generated segmentation maps. Given a 3D volume and its
putative segmentation map, we propose an approach to identify and measure
erroneous regions in the segmentation map. Our method can estimate error at any
point or node in a 3D mesh generated from a possibly erroneous volumetric
segmentation map, serving as a Quality Assurance tool. We propose a graph
neural network-based transformer based on the Nodeformer architecture to
measure and classify the segmentation errors at any point. We have evaluated
our network on a high-resolution micro-CT dataset of the human inner-ear bony
labyrinth structure by simulating erroneous 3D segmentation maps. Our network
incorporates a convolutional encoder to compute node-centric features from the
input micro-CT data, the Nodeformer to learn the latent graph embeddings, and a
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to compute and classify the node-wise errors. Our
network achieves a mean absolute error of ~0.042 over other Graph Neural
Networks (GNN) and an accuracy of 79.53% over other GNNs in estimating and
classifying the node-wise errors, respectively. We also put forth vertex-normal
prediction as a custom pretext task for pre-training the CNN encoder to improve
the network's overall performance. Qualitative analysis shows the efficiency of
our network in correctly classifying errors and reducing misclassifications.

<p class="mathjax">Driven by exploring the power of quantum computation with a limited number of
qubits, we present a novel complete characterization for space-bounded quantum
computation, which encompasses settings with one-sided error (unitary coRQL)
and two-sided error (BQL), approached from a quantum state testing perspective:
<br />- The first family of natural complete problems for unitary coRQL, i.e.,
space-bounded quantum state certification for trace distance and
Hilbert-Schmidt distance;
<br />- A new family of natural complete problems for BQL, i.e., space-bounded
quantum state testing for trace distance, Hilbert-Schmidt distance, and quantum
entropy difference.
<br />In the space-bounded quantum state testing problem, we consider two
logarithmic-qubit quantum circuits (devices) denoted as $Q_0$ and $Q_1$, which
prepare quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$, respectively, with access to
their ``source code''. Our goal is to decide whether $\rho_0$ is
$\epsilon_1$-close to or $\epsilon_2$-far from $\rho_1$ with respect to a
specified distance-like measure. Interestingly, unlike time-bounded state
testing problems, which exhibit computational hardness depending on the chosen
distance-like measure (either QSZK-complete or BQP-complete), our results
reveal that the space-bounded state testing problems, considering all three
measures, are computationally as easy as preparing quantum states.
<br />Our results primarily build upon a space-efficient variant of the quantum
singular value transformation (QSVT) introduced by Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe
(STOC 2019), which is of independent interest. Our technique provides a unified
approach for designing space-bounded quantum algorithms. Specifically, we show
that implementing QSVT for any bounded polynomial that approximates a
piecewise-smooth function incurs only a constant overhead in terms of the space
required for special forms of the projected unitary encoding.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new class of balanced allocation processes which bias towards
underloaded bins (those with load below the mean load) either by skewing the
probability by which a bin is chosen for an allocation (probability bias), or
alternatively, by adding more balls to an underloaded bin (weight bias). A
prototypical process satisfying the probability bias condition is
Mean-Thinning: At each round, we sample one bin and if it is underloaded, we
allocate one ball; otherwise, we allocate one ball to a second bin sample.
Versions of this process have been in use since at least 1986. An example of a
process, introduced by us, which satisfies the weight bias condition is
Twinning: At each round, we only sample one bin. If the bin is underloaded,
then we allocate two balls; otherwise, we allocate only one ball.
<br />Our main result is that for any process with a probability or weight bias,
with high probability the gap between maximum and minimum load is logarithmic
in the number of bins. This result holds for any number of allocated balls
(heavily loaded case), covers many natural processes that relax the Two-Choice
process, and we also prove it is tight for many such processes, including
Mean-Thinning and Twinning.
<br />Our analysis employs a delicate interplay between linear, quadratic and
exponential potential functions. It also hinges on a phenomenon we call ``mean
quantile stabilization'', which holds in greater generality than our framework
and may be of independent interest.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion MRI is commonly performed using echo-planar imaging (EPI) due to
its rapid acquisition time. However, the resolution of diffusion-weighted
images is often limited by magnetic field inhomogeneity-related artifacts and
blurring induced by T2- and T2*-relaxation effects. To address these
limitations, multi-shot EPI (msEPI) combined with parallel imaging techniques
is frequently employed. Nevertheless, reconstructing msEPI can be challenging
due to phase variation between multiple shots. In this study, we introduce a
novel msEPI reconstruction approach called zero-MIRID (zero-shot
self-supervised learning of Multi-shot Image Reconstruction for Improved
Diffusion MRI). This method jointly reconstructs msEPI data by incorporating
deep learning-based image regularization techniques. The network incorporates
CNN denoisers in both k- and image-spaces, while leveraging virtual coils to
enhance image reconstruction conditioning. By employing a self-supervised
learning technique and dividing sampled data into three groups, the proposed
approach achieves superior results compared to the state-of-the-art parallel
imaging method, as demonstrated in an in-vivo experiment.
