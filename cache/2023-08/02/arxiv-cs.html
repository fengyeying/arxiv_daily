<p class="mathjax">Temporal commonsense reasoning refers to the ability to understand the
typical temporal context of phrases, actions, and events, and use it to reason
over problems requiring such knowledge. This trait is essential in temporal
natural language processing tasks, with possible applications such as timeline
summarization, temporal question answering, and temporal natural language
inference. Recent research on the performance of large language models suggests
that, although they are adept at generating syntactically correct sentences and
solving classification tasks, they often take shortcuts in their reasoning and
fall prey to simple linguistic traps. This article provides an overview of
research in the domain of temporal commonsense reasoning, particularly focusing
on enhancing language model performance through a variety of augmentations and
their evaluation across a growing number of datasets. However, these augmented
models still struggle to approach human performance on reasoning tasks over
temporal common sense properties, such as the typical occurrence times,
orderings, or durations of events. We further emphasize the need for careful
interpretation of research to guard against overpromising evaluation results in
light of the shallow reasoning present in transformers. This can be achieved by
appropriately preparing datasets and suitable evaluation metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring equitable privacy experiences remains a challenge, especially for
marginalised and vulnerable populations (MVPs) who often hesitate to
participate or use digital services due to concerns about the privacy of their
sensitive information. In response, security research has emphasised the
importance of inclusive security and privacy practices to facilitate meaningful
engagement of MVPs online. However, research in this area is still in its early
stages, with other MVPs yet to be considered (such as low-income groups, and
refugees), novel engagement methods yet to be explored, and limited support for
software developers in building applications and services for MVPs. In 2022, we
initiated a UK Research Council funded Equitable Privacy project to address
these gaps. Our goal is to prioritise the privacy needs and requirements of
MVPs in the design and development of software applications and services.
<br />We design and implement a new participatory research approach -- community
studybeds -- in collaboration with third-sector organisations that support MVPs
to identify and tackle the challenges these groups encounter. In this paper, we
share the initial reflections and experiences of the Equitable Privacy project,
particularly emphasising the utilisation of our community studybeds.

<p class="mathjax">Attackers are now using sophisticated techniques, like polymorphism, to
change the attack pattern for each new attack. Thus, the detection of novel
attacks has become the biggest challenge for cyber experts and researchers.
Recently, anomaly and hybrid approaches are used for the detection of network
attacks. Detecting novel attacks, on the other hand, is a key enabler for a
wide range of IoT applications. Novel attacks can easily evade existing
signature-based detection methods and are extremely difficult to detect, even
going undetected for years. Existing machine learning models have also failed
to detect the attack and have a high rate of false positives. In this paper, a
rule-based deep neural network technique has been proposed as a framework for
addressing the problem of detecting novel attacks. The designed framework
significantly improves respective benchmark results, including the CICIDS 2017
dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model keeps a good
balance between attack detection, untruthful positive rates, and untruthful
negative rates. For novel attacks, the model has an accuracy of more than 99%.
During the automatic interaction between network-devices (IoT), security and
privacy are the primary obstacles. Our proposed method can handle these
obstacles efficiently and finally identify, and classify the different levels
of threats.

<p class="mathjax">Cocktail party problem is the scenario where it is difficult to separate or
distinguish individual speaker from a mixed speech from several speakers. There
have been several researches going on in this field but the size and complexity
of the model is being traded off with the accuracy and robustness of speech
separation. "Monaural multi-speaker speech separation" presents a
speech-separation model based on the Transformer architecture and its efficient
forms. The model has been trained with the LibriMix dataset containing diverse
speakers' utterances. The model separates 2 distinct speaker sources from a
mixed audio input. The developed model approaches the reduction in
computational complexity of the speech separation model, with minimum tradeoff
with the performance of prevalent speech separation model and it has shown
significant movement towards that goal. This project foresees, a rise in
contribution towards the ongoing research in the field of speech separation
with computational efficiency at its core.

<p class="mathjax">Historically, gold and silver have played distinct roles in traditional
monetary systems. While gold has primarily been revered as a superior store of
value, prompting individuals to hoard it, silver has commonly been used as a
medium of exchange. As the financial world evolves, the emergence of
cryptocurrencies has introduced a new paradigm of value and exchange. However,
the store-of-value characteristic of these digital assets remains largely
uncharted. Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, once likened Bitcoin to gold
and Litecoin to silver. To validate this analogy, our study employs several
metrics, including unspent transaction outputs (UTXO), spent transaction
outputs (STXO), Weighted Average Lifespan (WAL), CoinDaysDestroyed (CDD), and
public on-chain transaction data. Furthermore, we've devised trading strategies
centered around the Price-to-Utility (PU) ratio, offering a fresh perspective
on crypto-asset valuation beyond traditional utilities. Our back-testing
results not only display trading indicators for both Bitcoin and Litecoin but
also substantiate Lee's metaphor, underscoring Bitcoin's superior
store-of-value proposition relative to Litecoin. We anticipate that our
findings will drive further exploration into the valuation of crypto assets.
For enhanced transparency and to promote future research, we've made our
datasets available on Harvard Dataverse and shared our Python code on GitHub as
open source.

<p class="mathjax">We use Google's MusicVAE, a Variational Auto-Encoder with a 512-dimensional
latent space to represent a few bars of music, and organize the latent
dimensions according to their relevance in describing music. We find that, on
average, most latent neurons remain silent when fed real music tracks: we call
these "noise" neurons. The remaining few dozens of latent neurons that do fire
are called "music neurons". We ask which neurons carry the musical information
and what kind of musical information they encode, namely something that can be
identified as pitch, rhythm or melody. We find that most of the information
about pitch and rhythm is encoded in the first few music neurons: the neural
network has thus constructed a couple of variables that non-linearly encode
many human-defined variables used to describe pitch and rhythm. The concept of
melody only seems to show up in independent neurons for longer sequences of
music.

developments in Computer Science of the last decade. At the same time,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a
variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the
art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI.
In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an
alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for
generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and,
finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily
captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We
conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and

<p class="mathjax">Several sources of uncertainty have to be taken into account in the analysis
and design of CPS. The set of parameters used in the model of the physical
plant of a CPS may be uncertain due, for example, to manufacturing processes
that are precise up to some bounded tolerance. Physical quantities are sensed
by electronic components that add noise to the sensed signals. Abstraction of
the physical world, which is often necessary to limit the complexity of the
models used in analysis and at run-time in decision-making, leads to
non-determinism. The cyber side of a CPS, which includes both hardware and
software components, exposes several types of uncertainty such as failures,
latency, and implementation errors. Design processes and tools allow engineers
to minimize the impact of these types of uncertainty, and to deliver systems
which can be operated with an acceptable level of risk. In the past several
years, cyber-physical systems have evolved, primarily due to pervasive
connectivity, miniaturization, cost-effectiveness of hardware, and advances in
the area of Artificial Intelligence. This new class of applications features an
environment that is much more complex to model than traditional physical
systems due not only to their scale, but also to new sources and types of
uncertainty. Consider, for example, the typical case of echo chambers which is
attributed to the effect that machine learning algorithms have on the bias of
people. Such behavior is not easily predictable because of high uncertainty in
the environment (people), which is only approximately represented by machine
learning models, but that is inherently due to lack of knowledge. New models
and analysis methods are therefore needed to capture different types of
uncertainties, and to analyze these new classes of systems.

<p class="mathjax">As a representative cyber-physical system (CPS), robotic manipulator has been
widely adopted in various academic research and industrial processes,
indicating its potential to act as a universal interface between the cyber and
the physical worlds. Recent studies in robotics manipulation have started
employing artificial intelligence (AI) approaches as controllers to achieve
better adaptability and performance. However, the inherent challenge of
explaining AI components introduces uncertainty and unreliability to these
AI-enabled robotics systems, necessitating a reliable development platform for
system design and performance assessment. As a foundational step towards
building reliable AI-enabled robotics systems, we propose a public industrial
benchmark for robotics manipulation in this paper. It leverages NVIDIA
Omniverse Isaac Sim as the simulation platform, encompassing eight
representative manipulation tasks and multiple AI software controllers. An
extensive evaluation is conducted to analyze the performance of AI controllers
in solving robotics manipulation tasks, enabling a thorough understanding of
their effectiveness. To further demonstrate the applicability of our benchmark,
we develop a falsification framework that is compatible with physical
simulators and OpenAI Gym environments. This framework bridges the gap between
traditional testing methods and modern physics engine-based simulations. The
effectiveness of different optimization methods in falsifying AI-enabled
robotics manipulation with physical simulators is examined via a falsification
test. Our work not only establishes a foundation for the design and development
of AI-enabled robotics systems but also provides practical experience and
guidance to practitioners in this field, promoting further research in this
critical academic and industrial domain.

<p class="mathjax">Given that language models are trained on vast datasets that may contain
inherent biases, there is a potential danger of inadvertently perpetuating
systemic discrimination. Consequently, it becomes essential to examine and
address biases in language models, integrating fairness into their development
to ensure these models are equitable and free from bias. In this work, we
demonstrate the importance of reasoning in zero-shot stereotype identification
based on Vicuna-13B-v1.3. While we do observe improved accuracy by scaling from
13B to 33B, we show that the performance gain from reasoning significantly
exceeds the gain from scaling up. Our findings suggest that reasoning could be
a key factor that enables LLMs to trescend the scaling law on out-of-domain
tasks such as stereotype identification. Additionally, through a qualitative
analysis of select reasoning traces, we highlight how reasoning enhances not
just accuracy but also the interpretability of the decision.

<p class="mathjax">OpenAI's ChatGPT language model has gained popularity as a powerful tool for
complex problem-solving and information retrieval. However, concerns arise
about the reproduction of biases present in the language-specific training
data. In this study, we address this issue in the context of the
Israeli-Palestinian and Turkish-Kurdish conflicts. Using GPT-3.5, we employed
an automated query procedure to inquire about casualties in specific
airstrikes, in both Hebrew and Arabic for the former conflict and Turkish and
Kurdish for the latter. Our analysis reveals that GPT-3.5 provides 27$\pm$11
percent lower fatality estimates when queried in the language of the attacker
than in the language of the targeted group. Evasive answers denying the
existence of such attacks further increase the discrepancy, creating a novel
bias mechanism not present in regular search engines. This language bias has
the potential to amplify existing media biases and contribute to information
bubbles, ultimately reinforcing conflicts.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection and its explanation is important in many research areas
such as intrusion detection, fraud detection, unknown attack detection in
network traffic and logs. It is challenging to identify the cause or
explanation of why one instance is an anomaly? and the other is not due to its
unbounded and lack of supervisory nature. The answer to this question is
possible with the emerging technique of explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). XAI provides tools and techniques to interpret and explain the output
and working of complex models such as Deep Learning (DL). This paper aims to
detect and explain network anomalies with XAI, kernelSHAP method. The same
approach is used to improve the network anomaly detection model in terms of
accuracy, recall, precision and f score. The experiment is conduced with the
latest CICIDS2017 dataset. Two models are created (Model_1 and OPT_Model) and
compared. The overall accuracy and F score of OPT_Model (when trained in
unsupervised way) are 0.90 and 0.76, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents novel technology and methodology aimed at enhancing crowd
management in both the planning and operational phases. The approach
encompasses innovative data collection techniques, data integration, and
visualization using a 3D Digital Twin, along with the incorporation of
artificial intelligence (AI) tools for risk identification. The paper
introduces the Bowtie model, a comprehensive framework designed to assess and
predict risk levels. The model combines objective estimations and predictions,
such as traffic flow operations and crowdedness levels, with various
aggravating factors like weather conditions, sentiments, and the purpose of
visitors, to evaluate the expected risk of incidents. The proposed framework is
applied to the Crowd Safety Manager project in Scheveningen, where the DigiTwin
is developed based on a wealth of real-time data sources. One noteworthy data
source is Resono, offering insights into the number of visitors and their
movements, leveraging a mobile phone panel of over 2 million users in the
Netherlands. Particular attention is given to the left-hand side of the Bowtie,
which includes state estimation, prediction, and forecasting. Notably, the
focus is on generating multi-day ahead forecasts for event-planning purposes
using Resono data. Advanced machine learning techniques, including the XGBoost
framework, are compared, with XGBoost demonstrating the most accurate
forecasts. The results indicate that the predictions are adequately accurate.
However, certain locations may benefit from additional input data to further
enhance prediction quality. Despite these limitations, this work contributes to
a more effective crowd management system and opens avenues for further
advancements in this critical field.

<p class="mathjax">Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an essential tool in securing
cyberspace from a variety of security risks and unknown cyberattacks. A number
of solutions have been implemented for Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning
(DL) based NIDS. However, all these solutions are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, in which the malicious actor tries to evade or fool the model by
injecting adversarial perturbed examples into the system. The main aim of this
research work is to study powerful adversarial attack algorithms and their
defence method on DL-based NIDS. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Jacobian
Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Carlini &amp;
Wagner (C&amp;W) are four powerful adversarial attack methods implemented against
the NIDS. As a defence method, Adversarial Training is used to increase the
robustness of the NIDS model. The results are summarized in three phases, i.e.,
1) before the adversarial attack, 2) after the adversarial attack, and 3) after
the adversarial defence. The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion
Detection System 2017 (CICIDS-2017) dataset is used for evaluation purposes
with various performance measurements like f1-score, accuracy etc.

wellbeing. However, there is limited understanding of how these technologies
are currently designed to support children with their health concerns or
wellness goals. To gain insight into the current landscape of mobile apps
designed for children's health, we retrieved and reviewed 43 apps from IOS and
Google Play store that are specifically marketed for children. Our qualitative
analysis identified the dominant health focuses and goals of children's mobile
health apps. We analyzed the primary users and their expectations as well as
the methods of engagement and involvement adopted. Based on our findings, we
discussed the opportunities to support children with chronic illnesses through
mobile apps, design for dual use, and design for age appropriateness and
digital health safety. This study provides insights and recommendations for app
designers, health researchers, and policymakers on strategies for engaging
children and parents while also promoting children's health and wellbeing
through mobile technology.

<p class="mathjax">Embedding based Knowledge Graph (KG) Completion has gained much attention
over the past few years. Most of the current algorithms consider a KG as a
multidirectional labeled graph and lack the ability to capture the semantics
underlying the schematic information. In a separate development, a vast amount
of information has been captured within the Large Language Models (LLMs) which
has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence. KGs could benefit from
these LLMs and vice versa. This vision paper discusses the existing algorithms
for KG completion based on the variations for generating KG embeddings. It
starts with discussing various KG completion algorithms such as transductive
and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms. It then
moves on to the algorithms utilizing type information within the KGs, LLMs, and
finally to algorithms capturing the semantics represented in different
description logic axioms. We conclude the paper with a critical reflection on
the current state of work in the community and give recommendations for future
directions.

commonsense knowledge or reasoning about the causes of emotions to better
understand the user's experiences and feelings. However, these approaches
mainly focus on understanding the causalities of context from the user's
perspective, ignoring the system's perspective. In this paper, we propose a
commonsense-based causality explanation approach for diverse empathetic
response generation that considers both the user's perspective (user's desires
and reactions) and the system's perspective (system's intentions and
reactions). We enhance ChatGPT's ability to reason for the system's perspective
by integrating in-context learning with commonsense knowledge. Then, we
integrate the commonsense-based causality explanation with both ChatGPT and a
T5-based model. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method
outperforms other comparable methods on both automatic and human evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Geo-localization (VG) has emerged as a significant research area,
aiming to identify geolocation based on visual features. Most VG approaches use
learnable feature extractors for representation learning. Recently,
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have also demonstrated comparable
performance to supervised methods by using numerous unlabeled images for
representation learning. In this work, we present a novel unified VG-SSL
framework with the goal to enhance performance and training efficiency on a
large VG dataset by SSL methods. Our work incorporates multiple SSL methods
tailored for VG: SimCLR, MoCov2, BYOL, SimSiam, Barlow Twins, and VICReg. We
systematically analyze the performance of different training strategies and
study the optimal parameter settings for the adaptation of SSL methods for the
VG task. The results demonstrate that our method, without the significant
computation and memory usage associated with Hard Negative Mining (HNM), can
match or even surpass the VG performance of the baseline that employs HNM. The
code is available at https://github.com/arplaboratory/VG_SSL.

<p class="mathjax">Dense packing in pick-and-place systems is an important feature in many
warehouse and logistics applications. Prior work in this space has largely
focused on planning algorithms in simulation, but real-world packing
performance is often bottlenecked by the difficulty of perceiving 3D object
geometry in highly occluded, partially observed scenes. In this work, we
present a fully-convolutional shape completion model, F-CON, which can be
easily combined with off-the-shelf planning methods for dense packing in the
real world. We also release a simulated dataset, COB-3D-v2, that can be used to
train shape completion models for real-word robotics applications, and use it
to demonstrate that F-CON outperforms other state-of-the-art shape completion
methods. Finally, we equip a real-world pick-and-place system with F-CON, and
demonstrate dense packing of complex, unseen objects in cluttered scenes.
Across multiple planning methods, F-CON enables substantially better dense
packing than other shape completion methods.

<p class="mathjax">The difficulty of the fine-grained image classification mainly comes from a
shared overall appearance across classes. Thus, recognizing discriminative
details, such as eyes and beaks for birds, is a key in the task. However, this
is particularly challenging when training data is limited. To address this, we
propose Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM), a task-oriented channel attention
method tailored for fine-grained few-shot classification with two novel modules
Support Attention Module (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM highlights
channels encoding class-wise discriminative features, while QAM assigns higher
weights to object-relevant channels of the query. Based on these submodules,
TDM produces task-adaptive features by focusing on channels encoding
class-discriminative details and possessed by the query at the same time, for
accurate class-sensitive similarity measure between support and query
instances. While TDM influences high-level feature maps by task-adaptive
calibration of channel-wise importance, we further introduce Instance Attention
Module (IAM) operating in intermediate layers of feature extractors to
instance-wisely highlight object-relevant channels, by extending QAM. The
merits of TDM and IAM and their complementary benefits are experimentally
validated in fine-grained few-shot classification tasks. Moreover, IAM is also
shown to be effective in coarse-grained and cross-domain few-shot
classifications.

<p class="mathjax">The growing use of robots in urban environments has raised concerns about
potential safety hazards, especially in public spaces where humans and robots
may interact. In this paper, we present a system for safe human-robot
interaction that combines an infrared (IR) camera with a wearable marker and
airflow potential field. IR cameras enable real-time detection and tracking of
humans in challenging environments, while controlled airflow creates a physical
barrier that guides humans away from dangerous proximity to robots without the
need for wearable devices. A preliminary experiment was conducted to measure
the accuracy of the perception of safety barriers rendered by controlled air
pressure. In a second experiment, we evaluated our approach in an imitation
scenario of an interaction between an inattentive person and an autonomous
robotic system. Experimental results show that the proposed system
significantly improves a participant's ability to maintain a safe distance from
the operating robot compared to trials without the system.

<p class="mathjax">An open research question has been whether a single human can supervise a
true heterogeneous swarm of robots completing tasks in real world environments.
A general concern is whether or not the human's workload will be taxed to the
breaking point. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's OFFsensive
Swarm-Enabled Tactics program's field exercises that occurred at U.S. Army
urban training sites provided the opportunity to understand the impact of
achieving such swarm deployments. The Command and Control of Aggregate Swarm
Tactics integrator team's swarm commander users the heterogeneous robot swarm
to conduct relevant missions. During the final OFFSET program field exercise,
the team collected objective and subjective metrics related to teh swarm
commander's human performance. A multi-dimensional workload algorithm that
estimates overall workload based on five components of workload was used to
analyze the results. While the swarm commander's workload estimate did cross
the overload threshold frequently, the swarm commander was able to successfully
complete the missions, often under challenging operational conditions. The
presented results demonstrate that a single human can deploy a swarm of 100
heterogeneous robots to conduct real-world missions.

<p class="mathjax">The peak performance of any SpMV depends primarily on the available memory
bandwidth and its effective use. GPUs, ASICs, and new FPGAs have higher and
higher bandwidth; however, for large scale and highly sparse matrices, SpMV is
still a hard problem because of its random access pattern and workload
imbalance. Here, we show how to turn randomness to our advantage. We propose a
matrix permutation pre-processing step that aims to maximize the entropy of the
distribution of the nonzero elements. We seek any permutation that uniformly
distributes the non-zero elements' distribution, thereby generating a SpMV
problem that is amenable to work load balancing or to speed up sort algorithms.
We conjecture these permutations would be most effective for matrices with no
dense rows or columns and, as in preconditioning, when the matrix is reused. We
shall show that entropy maximization is an optimization that any architecture
may take advantage although in different ways. Most importantly, any developer
can consider and deploy. We shall present cases where we can improve
performance by 15\% on AMD-based (GPU-CPU) systems.

<p class="mathjax">Objectives: To describe the development and validation of a zero-shot
learning natural language processing (NLP) tool for abstracting data from
unstructured text contained within PDF documents, such as those found within
electronic health records. Materials and Methods: A data abstraction tool based
on the GPT-3.5 model from OpenAI was developed and compared to three physician
human abstractors in terms of time to task completion and accuracy for
abstracting data on 14 unique variables from a set of 199 de-identified radical
prostatectomy pathology reports. The reports were processed by the software
tool in vectorized and scanned formats to establish the impact of optical
character recognition on data abstraction. The tool was assessed for
superiority for data abstraction speed and non-inferiority for accuracy.
Results: The human abstractors required a mean of 101s per report for data
abstraction, with times varying from 15 to 284 s. In comparison, the software
tool required a mean of 12.8 s to process the vectorized reports and a mean of
15.8 to process the scanned reports (P &lt; 0.001). The overall accuracies of the
three human abstractors were 94.7%, 97.8%, and 96.4% for the combined set of
2786 datapoints. The software tool had an overall accuracy of 94.2% for the
vectorized reports, proving to be non-inferior to the human abstractors at a
margin of -10% ($\alpha$=0.025). The tool had a slightly lower accuracy of
88.7% using the scanned reports, proving to be non-inferiority to 2 out of 3
human abstractors. Conclusion: The developed zero-shot learning NLP tool
affords researchers comparable levels of accuracy to that of human abstractors,
with significant time savings benefits. Because of the lack of need for
task-specific model training, the developed tool is highly generalizable and
can be used for a wide variety of data abstraction tasks, even outside the
field of medicine.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT have contributed
significantly to the development of NLP. However, those models require large
computational resources, making it difficult to be applied to mobile devices
where computing power is limited. In this paper we aim to address the weakness
of existing input-adaptive inference methods which fail to take full advantage
of the structure of BERT. We propose Dynamic Planning in BERT, a novel
fine-tuning strategy that can accelerate the inference process of BERT through
selecting a subsequence of transformer layers list of backbone as a
computational path for an input sample. To do this, our approach adds a
planning module to the original BERT model to determine whether a layer is
included or bypassed during inference. Experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark exhibit that our method reduces latency to 75\% while maintaining
98\% accuracy, yielding a better accuracy-speed trade-off compared to
state-of-the-art input-adaptive methods.

<p class="mathjax">The task of discerning between generated and natural texts is increasingly
challenging. In this context, watermarking emerges as a promising technique for
ascribing generated text to a specific model. It alters the sampling generation
process so as to leave an invisible trace in the generated output, facilitating
later detection. This research consolidates watermarks for large language
models based on three theoretical and empirical considerations. First, we
introduce new statistical tests that offer robust theoretical guarantees which
remain valid even at low false-positive rates (less than 10$^{\text{-6}}$).
Second, we compare the effectiveness of watermarks using classical benchmarks
in the field of natural language processing, gaining insights into their
real-world applicability. Third, we develop advanced detection schemes for
scenarios where access to the LLM is available, as well as multi-bit
watermarking.

(a $2^5\times2^{484}$ matrix game), both of which depend on a positive-integer
parameter $d$, the number of decks. The key to solving the game under Model B2
was what we called Foster's algorithm, which applies to additive $2\times2^n$
matrix games. Here "additive" means that the payoffs are additive in the $n$
binary choices that comprise a player II pure strategy.
<br />In the present paper, we consider analogous models of the casino game baccara
chemin de fer that take into account the $100\,\alpha$ percent commission on
Banker (player II) wins, where $0\le\alpha\le1/10$. Thus, the game now depends
not just on the discrete parameter $d$ but also on a continuous parameter
$\alpha$. Moreover, the game is no longer zero sum. To find all Nash equilibria
under Model B2, we generalize Foster's algorithm to additive $2\times2^n$
bimatrix games. We find that, with rare exceptions, the Nash equilibrium is
unique. We also obtain a Nash equilibrium under Model B3, based on Model B2
results, but here we are unable to prove uniqueness.

<p class="mathjax">Humanoid robots are expected to navigate in changing environments and perform
a variety of tasks. Frequently, these tasks require the robot to make decisions
online regarding the speed and precision of following a reference path. For
example, a robot may want to decide to temporarily deviate from its path to
overtake a slowly moving obstacle that shares the same path and is ahead. In
this case, path following performance is compromised in favor of fast path
traversal. Available global trajectory tracking approaches typically assume a
given -- specified in advance -- time parametrization of the path and seek to
minimize the norm of the Cartesian error. As a result, when the robot should be
where on the path is fixed and temporary deviations from the path are strongly
discouraged. Given a global path, this paper presents a Model Predictive
Contouring Control (MPCC) approach to selecting footsteps that maximize path
traversal while simultaneously allowing the robot to decide between faithful
versus fast path following. The method is evaluated in high-fidelity
simulations of the bipedal robot Digit in terms of tracking performance of
curved paths under disturbances and is also applied to the case where Digit
overtakes a moving obstacle.

<p class="mathjax">The field of software security testing, more specifically penetration
testing, is an activity that requires high levels of expertise and involves
many manual testing and analysis steps. This paper explores the potential usage
of large-language models, such as GPT3.5, to augment penetration testers with
AI sparring partners. We explore the feasibility of supplementing penetration
testers with AI models for two distinct use cases: high-level task planning for
security testing assignments and low-level vulnerability hunting within a
vulnerable virtual machine. For the latter, we implemented a closed-feedback
loop between LLM-generated low-level actions with a vulnerable virtual machine
(connected through SSH) and allowed the LLM to analyze the machine state for
vulnerabilities and suggest concrete attack vectors which were automatically
executed within the virtual machine. We discuss promising initial results,
detail avenues for improvement, and close deliberating on the ethics of
providing AI-based sparring partners.

<p class="mathjax">We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion model-based Audio-VIusal Separation framework
that solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through a generative
manner. While existing discriminative methods that perform mask regression have
made remarkable progress in this field, they face limitations in capturing the
complex data distribution required for high-quality separation of sounds from
diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS leverages a generative diffusion model
and a Separation U-Net to synthesize separated magnitudes starting from
Gaussian noises, conditioned on both the audio mixture and the visual footage.
With its generative objective, DAVIS is better suited to achieving the goal of
high-quality sound separation across diverse categories. We compare DAVIS to
existing state-of-the-art discriminative audio-visual separation methods on the
domain-specific MUSIC dataset and the open-domain AVE dataset, and results show
that DAVIS outperforms other methods in separation quality, demonstrating the
advantages of our framework for tackling the audio-visual source separation
task.

<p class="mathjax">A full approximation scheme (FAS) nonlinear multigrid solver for two-phase
flow and transport problems driven by wells with multiple perforations is
developed. It is an extension to our previous work on FAS solvers for diffusion
and transport problems. The solver is applicable to discrete problems defined
on unstructured grids as the coarsening algorithm is aggregation-based and
algebraic. To construct coarse basis that can better capture the radial flow
near wells, coarse grids in which perforated well cells are not near the
coarse-element interface are desired. This is achieved by an aggregation
algorithm proposed in this paper that makes use of the location of well cells
in the cell-connectivity graph. Numerical examples in which the FAS solver is
compared against Newton's method on benchmark problems are given. In
particular, for a refined version of the SAIGUP model, the FAS solver is at
least 35% faster than Newton's method for time steps with a CFL number greater
than 10.

<p class="mathjax">Datacenters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous, and are starting to
include specialized hardware for networking, video processing, and especially
deep learning. To leverage the heterogeneous compute capability of modern
datacenters, we develop an approach for compiler-level partitioning of deep
neural networks (DNNs) onto multiple interconnected hardware devices. We
present a general framework for heterogeneous DNN compilation, offering
automatic partitioning and device mapping. Our scheduler integrates both an
exact solver, through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation,
and a modularity-based heuristic for scalability. Furthermore, we propose a
theoretical lower bound formula for the optimal solution, which enables the
assessment of the heuristic solutions' quality. We evaluate our scheduler in
optimizing both conventional DNNs and randomly-wired neural networks, subject
to latency and throughput constraints, on a heterogeneous system comprised of a
CPU and two distinct GPUs. Compared to na\"ively running DNNs on the fastest
GPU, he proposed framework can achieve more than 3$\times$ times lower latency
and up to 2.9$\times$ higher throughput by automatically leveraging both data
and model parallelism to deploy DNNs on our sample heterogeneous server node.
Moreover, our modularity-based "splitting" heuristic improves the solution
runtime up to 395$\times$ without noticeably sacrificing solution quality
compared to an exact MILP solution, and outperforms all other heuristics by
30-60% solution quality. Finally, our case study shows how we can extend our
framework to schedule large language models across multiple heterogeneous
servers by exploiting symmetry in the hardware setup. Our code can be easily
plugged in to existing frameworks, and is available at
https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/diviml.

<p class="mathjax">We develop an algorithm to control an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle
(USV) using kinodynamic motion planning with funnel control (KDF). KDF has two
key components: motion planning used to generate trajectories with respect to
kinodynamic constraints, and funnel control, also referred to as prescribed
performance control, which enables trajectory tracking in the presence of
uncertain dynamics and disturbances. We extend prescribed performance control
to address the challenges posed by underactuation and control-input saturation
present on the USV. The proposed scheme guarantees stability under user-defined
prescribed performance functions where model parameters and exogenous
disturbances are unknown. Furthermore, we present an optimization problem to
obtain smooth, collision-free trajectories while respecting kinodynamic
constraints. We deploy the algorithm on a USV and verify its efficiency in
real-world open-water experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Capturing and reconstructing a human actor's motion is important for
filmmaking and gaming. Currently, motion capture systems with static cameras
are used for pixel-level high-fidelity reconstructions. Such setups are costly,
require installation and calibration and, more importantly, confine the user to
a predetermined area. In this work, we present a drone-based motion capture
system that can alleviate these limitations. We present a complete system
implementation and study view planning which is critical for achieving
high-quality reconstructions. The main challenge for view planning for a
drone-based capture system is that it needs to be performed during motion
capture. To address this challenge, we introduce simple geometric primitives
and show that they can be used for view planning. Specifically, we introduce
Pixel-Per-Area (PPA) as a reconstruction quality proxy and plan views by
maximizing the PPA of the faces of a simple geometric shape representing the
actor. Through experiments in simulation, we show that PPA is highly correlated
with reconstruction quality. We also conduct real-world experiments showing
that our system can produce dynamic 3D reconstructions of good quality. We
share our code for the simulation experiments in the link:

<p class="mathjax">Large text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
generating diverse high-quality images that are closely aligned with text
prompt. But, when these models applied to video the main challenge is to ensure
temporal consistency and coherent editing. In this paper, we proposed InFusion,
a framework for zero-shot text-based video editing leveraging large pre-trained
image diffusion models. Our framework specifically supports editing of multiple
concepts with the pixel level control over diverse concepts mentioned in the
editing prompt. Specifically, we inject the difference of features from U-Net
residual blocks in decoder layers for source and edit prompt, this when
combined with injected attention features make it feasible to query the source
contents and scale the edited concepts along with injection of unedited parts.
The editing is further controlled in fine-grained manner with mask extraction
and attention fusion strategy which cuts the edited part from source and paste
it from the denoising pipeline for target prompt. Our framework is a low cost
alternative for the one-shot tuned models for editing since it does not require
training. We demonstrated the complex concept editing with generalised image
model (Stable Diffusion v1.5) using LoRA. Adaptation is compatible with all the
existing image diffusion techniques. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness over existing methods in rendering high-quality and
temporally consistent videos.

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation system services have become crucial for users to access
personalized goods or services as the global e-commerce market expands. They
can increase business sales growth and lower the cost of user information
exploration. Recent years have seen a signifi-cant increase in researchers
actively using user reviews to solve standard recommender system research
issues. Reviews may, however, contain information that does not help consumers
de-cide what to buy, such as advertising or fictitious or fake reviews. Using
such reviews to offer suggestion services may reduce the effectiveness of those
recommendations. In this research, the recommendation in e-commerce is
developed using passer learning optimization based on Bi-LSTM to solve that
issue (PL optimized Bi-LSTM). Data is first obtained from the product
recommendation dataset and pre-processed to remove any values that are missing
or incon-sistent. Then, feature extraction is performed using TF-IDF features
and features that support graph embedding. Before submitting numerous features
with the same dimensions to the Bi-LSTM classifier for analysis, they are
integrated using the feature concatenation approach. The Collaborative Bi-LSTM
method employs these features to determine if the model is a recommended
product. The PL optimization approach, which efficiently adjusts the
classifier's parameters and produces an extract output that measures the
f1-score, MSE, precision, and recall, is the basis of this research's
contributions. As compared to earlier methods, the pro-posed PL-optimized
Bi-LSTM achieved values of 88.58%, 1.24%, 92.69%, and 92.69% for dataset 1,
88.46%, 0.48%, 92.43%, and 93.47% for dataset 2, and 92.51%, 1.58%, 91.90%, and
90.76% for dataset 3.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the need to address the degeneracy of canonical Laplace learning
algorithms in low label rates, we propose to reformulate graph-based
semi-supervised learning as a nonconvex generalization of a \emph{Trust-Region
Subproblem} (TRS). This reformulation is motivated by the well-posedness of
Laplacian eigenvectors in the limit of infinite unlabeled data. To solve this
problem, we first show that a first-order condition implies the solution of a
manifold alignment problem and that solutions to the classical \emph{Orthogonal
Procrustes} problem can be used to efficiently find good classifiers that are
amenable to further refinement. Next, we address the criticality of selecting
supervised samples at low-label rates. We characterize informative samples with
a novel measure of centrality derived from the principal eigenvectors of a
certain submatrix of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate that our framework
achieves lower classification error compared to recent state-of-the-art and
classical semi-supervised learning methods at extremely low, medium, and high
label rates. Our code is available on github\footnote{anonymized for

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used as controllers in
reactive systems. However, DNNs are highly opaque, which renders it difficult
to explain and justify their actions. To mitigate this issue, there has been a
surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) techniques, capable of pinpointing
the input features that caused the DNN to act as it did.
<br />Existing XAI techniques typically face two limitations: (i) they are
heuristic, and do not provide formal guarantees that the explanations are
correct; and (ii) they often apply to ``one-shot'' systems (where the DNN is
invoked independently of past invocations), as opposed to reactive systems.
<br />Here, we begin bridging this gap, and propose a formal DNN-verification-based
XAI technique for reasoning about multi-step, reactive systems. We suggest
methods for efficiently calculating succinct explanations, by exploiting the
system's transition constraints in order to curtail the search space explored
by the underlying verifier. We evaluate our approach on two popular benchmarks
from the domain of automated navigation; and observe that our methods allow the
efficient computation of minimal and minimum explanations, while significantly
outperforming the state of the art. We also demonstrate that our method
produces formal explanations that are more reliable than competing,
non-verification-based XAI techniques.

further model, called a multiclock network, is then analyzed and shown to be a
refinement of the logical synchrony network. We present the bittide mechanism

<p class="mathjax">Node classification is one of the core tasks on attributed graphs, but
successful graph learning solutions require sufficiently labeled data. To keep
annotation costs low, active graph learning focuses on selecting the most
qualitative subset of nodes that maximizes label efficiency. However, deciding
which heuristic is best suited for an unlabeled graph to increase label
efficiency is a persistent challenge. Existing solutions either neglect
aligning the learned model and the sampling method or focus only on limited
selection aspects. They are thus sometimes worse or only equally good as random
sampling. In this work, we introduce a novel active graph learning approach
called DiffusAL, showing significant robustness in diverse settings. Toward
better transferability between different graph structures, we combine three
independent scoring functions to identify the most informative node samples for
labeling in a parameter-free way: i) Model Uncertainty, ii) Diversity
Component, and iii) Node Importance computed via graph diffusion heuristics.
Most of our calculations for acquisition and training can be pre-processed,
making DiffusAL more efficient compared to approaches combining diverse
selection criteria and similarly fast as simpler heuristics. Our experiments on
various benchmark datasets show that, unlike previous methods, our approach
significantly outperforms random selection in 100% of all datasets and labeling
budgets tested.

<p class="mathjax">Commit message generation (CMG) is a challenging task in automated software
engineering that aims to generate natural language descriptions of code changes
for commits. Previous methods all start from the modified code snippets,
outputting commit messages through template-based, retrieval-based, or
learning-based models. While these methods can summarize what is modified from
the perspective of code, they struggle to provide reasons for the commit. The
correlation between commits and issues that could be a critical factor for
generating rational commit messages is still unexplored.
<br />In this work, we delve into the correlation between commits and issues from
the perspective of dataset and methodology. We construct the first dataset
anchored on combining correlated commits and issues. The dataset consists of an
unlabeled commit-issue parallel part and a labeled part in which each example
is provided with human-annotated rational information in the issue.
Furthermore, we propose \tool (\underline{Ex}traction, \underline{Gro}unding,
\underline{Fi}ne-tuning), a novel paradigm that can introduce the correlation
between commits and issues into the training phase of models. To evaluate
whether it is effective, we perform comprehensive experiments with various
state-of-the-art CMG models. The results show that compared with the original
models, the performance of \tool-enhanced models is significantly improved.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel method for the interactive control of geometric
abstraction and texture in artistic images. Previous example-based stylization
methods often entangle shape, texture, and color, while generative methods for
image synthesis generally either make assumptions about the input image, such
as only allowing faces or do not offer precise editing controls. By contrast,
our holistic approach spatially decomposes the input into shapes and a
parametric representation of high-frequency details comprising the image's
texture, thus enabling independent control of color and texture. Each parameter
in this representation controls painterly attributes of a pipeline of
differentiable stylization filters. The proposed decoupling of shape and
texture enables various options for stylistic editing, including interactive
global and local adjustments of shape, stroke, and painterly attributes such as
surface relief and contours. Additionally, we demonstrate optimization-based
texture style-transfer in the parametric space using reference images and text
prompts, as well as the training of single- and arbitrary style parameter
prediction networks for real-time texture decomposition.

<p class="mathjax">With the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the
distribution grid, it is a challenge to effectively control a large number of
DERs resilient to the communication and security disruptions, as well as to
provide the online grid services, such as voltage regulation and virtual power
plant (VPP) dispatch. To this end, a hybrid feedback-based optimization
algorithm along with deep learning forecasting technique is proposed to
specifically address the cyber-related issues. The online decentralized
feedback-based DER optimization control requires timely, accurate voltage
measurement from the grid. However, in practice such information may not be
received by the control center or even be corrupted. Therefore, the long
short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm is employed to forecast
delayed/missed/attacked messages with high accuracy. The IEEE 37-node feeder
with high penetration of PV systems is used to validate the efficiency of the
proposed hybrid algorithm. The results show that 1) the LSTM-forecasted lost
voltage can effectively improve the performance of the DER control algorithm in
the practical cyber-physical architecture; and 2) the LSTM forecasting strategy
outperforms other strategies of using previous message and skipping dual
parameter update.

<p class="mathjax">Emerging deep neural network (DNN) applications require high-performance
multi-core hardware acceleration with large data bursts. Classical
network-on-chips (NoCs) use serial packet-based protocols suffering from
significant protocol translation overheads towards the endpoints. This paper
proposes PATRONoC, an open-source fully AXI-compliant NoC fabric to better
address the specific needs of multi-core DNN computing platforms. Evaluation of
PATRONoC in a 2D-mesh topology shows 34% higher area efficiency compared to a
state-of-the-art classical NoC at 1 GHz. PATRONoC's throughput outperforms a
baseline NoC by 2-8X on uniform random traffic and provides a high aggregated
throughput of up to 350 GiB/s on synthetic and DNN workload traffic.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is an evolving machine learning method in which
multiple clients participate in collaborative learning without sharing their
data with each other and the central server. In real-world applications such as
hospitals and industries, FL counters the challenges of data heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity as an inevitable part of the collaborative training. More
specifically, different organizations, such as hospitals, have their own
private data and customized models for local training. To the best of our
knowledge, the existing methods do not effectively address both problems of
model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity in FL. In this paper, we exploit the
data and model heterogeneity simultaneously, and propose a method, MDH-FL
(Exploiting Model and Data Heterogeneity in FL) to solve such problems to
enhance the efficiency of the global model in FL. We use knowledge distillation
and a symmetric loss to minimize the heterogeneity and its impact on the model
performance. Knowledge distillation is used to solve the problem of model
heterogeneity, and symmetric loss tackles with the data and label
heterogeneity. We evaluate our method on the medical datasets to conform the
real-world scenario of hospitals, and compare with the existing methods. The
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over
the other existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based RF fingerprinting offers great potential for improving
the security robustness of various emerging wireless networks. Although much
progress has been done in enhancing fingerprinting methods, the impact of
device hardware stabilization and warm-up time on the achievable fingerprinting
performances has not received adequate attention. As such, this paper focuses
on addressing this gap by investigating and shedding light on what could go
wrong if the hardware stabilization aspects are overlooked. Specifically, our
experimental results show that when the deep learning models are trained with
data samples captured after the hardware stabilizes but tested with data
captured right after powering on the devices, the device classification
accuracy drops below 37%. However, when both the training and testing data are
captured after the stabilization period, the achievable average accuracy
exceeds 99%, when the model is trained and tested on the same day, and achieves
88% and 96% when the model is trained on one day but tested on another day, for
the wireless and wired scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in this work, we
leverage simulation and testbed experimentation to explain the cause behind the
I/Q signal behavior observed during the device hardware warm-up time that led
to the RF fingerprinting performance degradation. Furthermore, we release a
large WiFi dataset, containing both unstable (collected during the warm-up
period) and stable (collected after the warm-up period) captures across
multiple days. Our work contributes datasets, explanations, and guidelines to
enhance the robustness of RF fingerprinting in securing emerging wireless
networks.

<p class="mathjax">Biomedical entity linking, also known as biomedical concept normalization,
has recently witnessed the rise to prominence of zero-shot contrastive models.
However, the pre-training material used for these models has, until now,
largely consisted of specialist biomedical content such as MIMIC-III clinical
notes (Johnson et al., 2016) and PubMed papers (Sayers et al., 2021; Gao et
al., 2020). While the resulting in-domain models have shown promising results
for many biomedical tasks, adverse drug event normalization on social media
texts has so far remained challenging for them (Portelli et al., 2022). In this
paper, we propose a new approach for adverse drug event normalization on social
media relying on general-purpose model initialization via BioLORD (Remy et al.,
2022) and a semantic-text-similarity fine-tuning named STS. Our experimental
results on several social media datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, by achieving state-of-the-art performance. Based on its
strong performance across all the tested datasets, we believe this work could
emerge as a turning point for the task of adverse drug event normalization on
social media and has the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research
in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Multispectral imagery is frequently incorporated into agricultural tasks,
providing valuable support for applications such as image segmentation, crop
monitoring, field robotics, and yield estimation. From an image segmentation
perspective, multispectral cameras can provide rich spectral information,
helping with noise reduction and feature extraction. As such, this paper
concentrates on the use of fusion approaches to enhance the segmentation
process in agricultural applications. More specifically, in this work, we
compare different fusion approaches by combining RGB and NDVI as inputs for
crop row detection, which can be useful in autonomous robots operating in the
field. The inputs are used individually as well as combined at different times
of the process (early and late fusion) to perform classical and DL-based
semantic segmentation. In this study, two agriculture-related datasets are
subjected to analysis using both deep learning (DL)-based and classical
segmentation methodologies. The experiments reveal that classical segmentation
methods, utilizing techniques such as edge detection and thresholding, can
effectively compete with DL-based algorithms, particularly in tasks requiring
precise foreground-background separation. This suggests that traditional
methods retain their efficacy in certain specialized applications within the
agricultural domain. Moreover, among the fusion strategies examined, late
fusion emerges as the most robust approach, demonstrating superiority in
adaptability and effectiveness across varying segmentation scenarios. The
dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Cybonic/MISAgriculture.git.

<p class="mathjax">Network control theory can be used to model how one should steer the brain
between different states by driving a specific region with an input. The needed
energy to control a network is often used to quantify its controllability, and
controlling brain networks requires diverse energy depending on the selected
input region. We use the theory of how input node placement affects the longest
control chain (LCC) in the controllability of brain networks to study the role
of the architecture of white matter fibers in the required control energy. We
show that the energy needed to control human brain networks is related to the
LCC, i.e., the longest distance between the input region and other regions in
the network. We indicate that regions that control brain networks with lower
energy have small LCCs. These regions align with areas that can steer the brain
around the state space smoothly. By contrast, regions that need higher energy
to move the brain toward different target states have larger LCCs. We also
investigate the role of the number of paths between regions in the control
energy. Our results show that the more paths between regions, the lower cost
needed to control brain networks. We evaluate the number of paths by counting
specific motifs in brain networks since determining all paths in graphs is a
difficult problem.

<p class="mathjax">Legal judgment prediction is the task of predicting the outcome of court
cases on a given text description of facts of cases. These tasks apply Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict legal judgment results based on
facts. Recently, large-scale public datasets and NLP models have increased
research in areas related to legal judgment prediction systems. For such
systems to be practically helpful, they should be robust from adversarial
attacks. Previous works mainly focus on making a neural legal judgement system;
however, significantly less or no attention has been given to creating a robust
Legal Judgement Prediction(LJP) system. We implemented adversarial attacks on
early existing LJP systems and found that none of them could handle attacks. In
this work, we proposed an approach for making robust LJP systems. Extensive
experiments on three legal datasets show significant improvements in our
approach over the state-of-the-art LJP system in handling adversarial attacks.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to increase the robustness of
early-existing LJP systems.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-label classification is a widely encountered problem in daily life,
where an instance can be associated with multiple classes. In theory, this is a
supervised learning method that requires a large amount of labeling. However,
annotating data is time-consuming and may be infeasible for huge labeling
spaces. In addition, label imbalance can limit the performance of multi-label
classifiers, especially when some labels are missing. Therefore, it is
meaningful to study how to train neural networks using partial labels. In this
work, we address the issue of label imbalance and investigate how to train
classifiers using partial labels in large labeling spaces. First, we introduce
the pseudo-labeling technique, which allows commonly adopted networks to be
applied in partially labeled settings without the need for additional complex
structures. Then, we propose a novel loss function that leverages statistical
information from existing datasets to effectively alleviate the label imbalance
problem. In addition, we design a dynamic training scheme to reduce the
dimension of the labeling space and further mitigate the imbalance. Finally, we
conduct extensive experiments on some publicly available multi-label datasets
such as COCO, NUS-WIDE, CUB, and Open Images to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. The results show that our approach outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, and surprisingly, in some partial labeling
settings, our approach even exceeds the methods trained with full labels.

<p class="mathjax">Rigorous testing of small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) is crucial to ensure
their safe and reliable deployment in the real world. sUAS developers aim to
validate the reliability and safety of their applications through simulation
testing. However, the dynamic nature of the real-world environment, including
factors such as challenging weather conditions and wireless interference,
causes unique software faults that may only be revealed through field testing.
Considering the high cost and impracticality of conducting field testing in
thousands of environmental contexts and conditions, there exists a pressing
need to develop automated techniques that can generate high-fidelity, realistic
environments enabling sUAS developers to deploy their applications and conduct
thorough simulation testing in close-to-reality environmental conditions. To
address this need, DroneReqValidator (DRV) offers a comprehensive small
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) simulation ecosystem that automatically
generates realistic environments based on developer-specified constraints,
monitors sUAV activities against predefined safety parameters, and generates
detailed acceptance test reports for effective debugging and analysis of sUAV
applications. Providing these capabilities, DRV offers a valuable solution for
enhancing the testing and development process of sUAS. The comprehensive demo
of DRV is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd9ft55gbO8

<p class="mathjax">Sequence theories are an extension of theories of strings with an infinite
alphabet of letters, together with a corresponding alphabet theory (e.g. linear
integer arithmetic). Sequences are natural abstractions of extendable arrays,
which permit a wealth of operations including append, map, split, and
concatenation. In spite of the growing amount of tool support for theories of
sequences by leading SMT-solvers, little is known about the decidability of
sequence theories, which is in stark contrast to the state of the theories of
strings. We show that the decidable theory of strings with concatenation and
regular constraints can be extended to the world of sequences over an alphabet
theory that forms a Boolean algebra, while preserving decidability. In
particular, decidability holds when regular constraints are interpreted as
parametric automata (which extend both symbolic automata and variable
automata), but fails when interpreted as register automata (even over the
alphabet theory of equality). When length constraints are added, the problem is
Turing-equivalent to word equations with length (and regular) constraints.
Similar investigations are conducted in the presence of symbolic transducers,
which naturally model sequence functions like map, split, filter, etc. We have
developed a new sequence solver, SeCo, based on parametric automata, and show
its efficacy on two classes of benchmarks: (i) invariant checking on
array-manipulating programs and parameterized systems, and (ii) benchmarks on
symbolic register automata.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of embedding point cloud data sampled from an
underlying manifold with an associated flow or velocity. Such data arises in
many contexts where static snapshots of dynamic entities are measured,
including in high-throughput biology such as single-cell transcriptomics.
Existing embedding techniques either do not utilize velocity information or
embed the coordinates and velocities independently, i.e., they either impose
velocities on top of an existing point embedding or embed points within a
prescribed vector field. Here we present FlowArtist, a neural network that
embeds points while jointly learning a vector field around the points. The
combination allows FlowArtist to better separate and visualize
velocity-informed structures. Our results, on toy datasets and single-cell RNA
velocity data, illustrate the value of utilizing coordinate and velocity
information in tandem for embedding and visualizing high-dimensional data.

<p class="mathjax">While deep learning (DL) models are state-of-the-art in text and image
domains, they have not yet consistently outperformed Gradient Boosted Decision
Trees (GBDTs) on tabular Learning-To-Rank (LTR) problems. Most of the recent
performance gains attained by DL models in text and image tasks have used
unsupervised pretraining, which exploits orders of magnitude more unlabeled
data than labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, unsupervised pretraining
has not been applied to the LTR problem, which often produces vast amounts of
unlabeled data. In this work, we study whether unsupervised pretraining can
improve LTR performance over GBDTs and other non-pretrained models. Using
simple design choices--including SimCLR-Rank, our ranking-specific modification
of SimCLR (an unsupervised pretraining method for images)--we produce
pretrained deep learning models that soundly outperform GBDTs (and other
non-pretrained models) in the case where labeled data is vastly outnumbered by
unlabeled data. We also show that pretrained models also often achieve
significantly better robustness than non-pretrained models (GBDTs or DL models)
in ranking outlier data.

<p class="mathjax">This paper employs an anomaly detection algorithm to assess the normal
operation of underwater gliders in unpredictable ocean environments. Real-time
alerts can be provided to glider pilots upon detecting any anomalies, enabling
them to assume control of the glider and prevent further harm. The detection
algorithm is applied to abundant data sets collected in real glider deployments
led by the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO) and the University of
South Florida (USF). Regarding generality, the experimental evaluation is
composed of both offline and online detection modes. The offline detection
utilizes full post-recovery data sets, which carries high-resolution
information, to present detailed analysis of the anomaly and compare it with
pilot logs. The online detection focuses on the real-time subsets of data
transmitted from the glider at the surfacing events. While the real-time data
may not contain as much rich information as the post-recovery data, the online
detection is of great importance as it allows glider pilots to monitor
potential abnormal conditions in real time.

<p class="mathjax">This work briefly covers our efforts to stabilize the flight dynamics of
Northeastern's tailless bat-inspired micro aerial vehicle, Aerobat. Flapping
robots are not new. A plethora of examples is mainly dominated by insect-style
design paradigms that are passively stable. However, Aerobat, in addition for
being tailless, possesses morphing wings that add to the inherent complexity of
flight control. The robot can dynamically adjust its wing platform
configurations during gait cycles, increasing its efficiency and agility. We
employ a guard design with manifold small thrusters to stabilize Aerobat's
position and orientation in hovering, a flapping system in tandem with a
multi-rotor. For flight control purposes, we take an approach based on assuming
the guard cannot observe Aerobat's states. Then, we propose an observer to
estimate the unknown states of the guard which are then used for closed-loop
hovering control of the Guard-Aerobat platform.

<p class="mathjax">A learning-based modular motion planning pipeline is presented that is
compliant, safe, and reactive to perturbations at task execution. A nominal
motion plan, defined as a nonlinear autonomous dynamical system (DS), is
learned offline from kinesthetic demonstrations using a Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) model. To ensure both stability and safety during
inference, a novel approach is proposed which selects a target point at each
time step for the robot to follow, using a time-varying target trajectory
generated by the learned NODE. A correction term to the NODE model is computed
online by solving a Quadratic Program that guarantees stability and safety
using Control Lyapunov Functions and Control Barrier Functions, respectively.
Our approach outperforms baseline DS learning techniques on the LASA
handwriting dataset and is validated on real-robot experiments where it is
shown to produce stable motions, such as wiping and stirring, while being
robust to physical perturbations and safe around humans and obstacles.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR sensors play an important role in the perception stack of modern
autonomous driving systems. Adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog and
dust, as well as some (occasional) LiDAR hardware fault may cause the LiDAR to
produce pointcloud with abnormal patterns such as scattered noise points and
uncommon intensity values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect
whether a LiDAR is generating anomalous pointcloud by analyzing the pointcloud
characteristics. Specifically, we develop a pointcloud quality metric based on
the LiDAR points' spatial and intensity distribution to characterize the noise
level of the pointcloud, which relies on pure mathematical analysis and does
not require any labeling or training as learning-based methods do. Therefore,
the method is scalable and can be quickly deployed either online to improve the
autonomy safety by monitoring anomalies in the LiDAR data or offline to perform
in-depth study of the LiDAR behavior over large amount of data. The proposed
approach is studied with extensive real public road data collected by LiDARs
with different scanning mechanisms and laser spectrums, and is proven to be
able to effectively handle various known and unknown sources of pointcloud
anomaly.

<p class="mathjax">Coaxing out desired behavior from pretrained models, while avoiding
undesirable ones, has redefined NLP and is reshaping how we interact with
computers. What was once a scientific engineering discipline-in which building
blocks are stacked one on top of the other-is arguably already a complex
systems science, in which emergent behaviors are sought out to support
previously unimagined use cases.
<br />Despite the ever increasing number of benchmarks that measure task
performance, we lack explanations of what behaviors language models exhibit
that allow them to complete these tasks in the first place. We argue for a
systematic effort to decompose language model behavior into categories that
explain cross-task performance, to guide mechanistic explanations and help
future-proof analytic research.

<p class="mathjax">Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising approach for visual
recognition tasks, revolutionizing the field by leveraging the power of
transformer-based architectures. Among the various ViT models, Swin
Transformers have gained considerable attention due to their hierarchical
design and ability to capture both local and global visual features
effectively. This paper evaluates the performance of Swin ViT model using
gradient accumulation optimization (GAO) technique. We investigate the impact
of gradient accumulation optimization technique on the model's accuracy and
training time. Our experiments show that applying the GAO technique leads to a
significant decrease in the accuracy of the Swin ViT model, compared to the
standard Swin Transformer model. Moreover, we detect a significant increase in
the training time of the Swin ViT model when GAO model is applied. These
findings suggest that applying the GAO technique may not be suitable for the
Swin ViT model, and concern should be undertaken when using GAO technique for
other transformer-based models.

<p class="mathjax">A fundamental theme in automata theory is regular languages of words and
trees, and their many equivalent definitions. Salvati has proposed a
generalization to regular languages of simply typed lambda-terms, defined using
denotational semantics in finite sets.
<br />We provide here some evidence for its robustness. First, we give an
equivalent characterization that naturally extends the seminal work of
Hillebrand and Kanellakis connecting regular languages of words and syntactic
lambda-definability. Second, we exhibit a class of categorical models of the
simply typed lambda-calculus, which we call finitely pointable, and we show
that, when used in Salvati's definition, they all recognize exactly the same
class of languages of lambda-terms as the category of finite sets does.
<br />The proofs of these two results rely on logical relations and can be seen as
instances of a more general construction of a categorical nature, inspired by
previous categorical accounts of logical relations using the glueing
construction

<p class="mathjax">For most real-world applications, robots need to adapt and learn continually
with limited data in their environments. In this paper, we consider the problem
of Few-Shot class Incremental Learning (FSIL), in which an AI agent is required
to learn incrementally from a few data samples without forgetting the data it
has previously learned. To solve this problem, we present a novel framework
inspired by theories of concept learning in the hippocampus and the neocortex.
Our framework represents object classes in the form of sets of clusters and
stores them in memory. The framework replays data generated by the clusters of
the old classes, to avoid forgetting when learning new classes. Our approach is
evaluated on two object classification datasets resulting in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance for class-incremental learning and FSIL. We also evaluate
our framework for FSIL on a robot demonstrating that the robot can continually
learn to classify a large set of household objects with limited human
assistance.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a computing framework that combines Flow-Based
Programming (FBP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable Just-In-Time
Programming (JITP). JITP empowers users, regardless of their programming
expertise, to actively participate in the development and automation process by
leveraging their task-time algorithmic insights. By seamlessly integrating LLMs
into the FBP workflow, the framework allows users to request and generate code
in real-time, enabling dynamic code execution within a flow-based program. The
paper explores the motivations, principles, and benefits of JITP, showcasing
its potential in automating tasks, orchestrating data workflows, and
accelerating software development. Through a fully implemented JITP framework
using the Composable platform, we explore several examples and use cases to
illustrate the benefits of the framework in data engineering, data science and
software development. The results demonstrate how the fusion of FBP and LLMs
creates a powerful and user-centric computing paradigm.

segmentation algorithm used in real-time video stream interpretation. It
complements CNN-based models to make use of temporal information in videos.
2SDS can detect the change between scenes in a video stream by com-paring the
image difference between two frames. It separates a video into segments
(scenes), and by combining itself with a CNN model, 2SDS can select the optimal
result for each scene. In this paper, we will be discussing some basic methods
and concepts behind 2SDS, as well as presenting some preliminary experiment

<p class="mathjax">Many tasks performed in image-guided, mini-invasive, medical procedures can
be cast as pose estimation problems, where an X-ray projection is utilized to
reach a target in 3D space. Recent advances in the differentiable rendering of
optically reflective materials have enabled state-of-the-art performance in RGB
camera view synthesis and pose estimation. Expanding on these prior works, we
introduce new methods for pose estimation of radiolucent objects using X-ray
projections, and we demonstrate the critical role of optimal view synthesis in
performing this task. We first develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficiently
computes Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automatic
differentiation within TensorFlow. In conjunction with classic CBCT
reconstruction algorithms, we perform pose estimation by gradient descent using
a loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from a
randomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose.
We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural Tuned
Tomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods rely
on classic CBCT; NeTT directly optimizes the CBCT densities, while the non-zero
values of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D mask of the anatomic region segmented
from CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT and mNeRF distinctly improve pose
estimation within our framework. By defining a successful pose estimate to be a
3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find that NeTT and mNeRF can achieve
similar results, both with overall success rates more than 93%. Furthermore, we
show that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesize
high-fidelity DRRs and ensure robust pose estimations for all other subjects.
Therefore, we suggest that NeTT is an attractive option for robust pose
estimation using fluoroscopic projections.

<p class="mathjax">The CHIPS Act is driving the U.S. towards a self-sustainable future in
domestic chip production. Decades of outsourced manufacturing, assembly,
testing, and packaging has diminished the workforce ecosystem, imposing major
limitations on semiconductor companies racing to build new fabrication sites as
part of the CHIPS Act. In response, a systemic alliance between academic
institutions, the industry, government, various consortiums, and organizations
has emerged to establish a pipeline to educate and onboard the next generation
of talent. Establishing a stable and continuous flow of talent requires
significant time investments and comes with no guarantees, particularly
factoring in the low workplace desirability in current fabrication houses for
U.S workforce. This paper will explore the feasibility of two paradigms of
Industry 4.0, automation and Augmented Reality(AR)/Virtual Reality(VR), to
complement ongoing workforce development efforts and optimize workplace
desirability by catalyzing core manufacturing processes and effectively
enhancing the education, onboarding, and professional realms-all with promising
capabilities amid the ongoing talent shortage and trajectory towards advanced
packaging.

<p class="mathjax">With the growing prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs) and advancements in EV
electronics, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) techniques and large-scale scheduling
strategies have emerged to promote renewable energy utilization and power grid
stability. This study proposes a multi-stakeholder hierarchical V2G
coordination based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the Proof of Stake
algorithm. Furthermore, the multi-stakeholders include the power grid, EV
aggregators (EVAs), and users, and the proposed strategy can achieve
multi-stakeholder benefits. On the grid side, load fluctuations and renewable
energy consumption are considered, while on the EVA side, energy constraints
and charging costs are considered. The three critical battery conditioning
parameters of battery SOX are considered on the user side, including state of
charge, state of power, and state of health. Compared with four typical
baselines, the multi-stakeholder hierarchical coordination strategy can enhance
renewable energy consumption, mitigate load fluctuations, meet the energy
demands of EVA, and reduce charging costs and battery degradation under
realistic operating conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past few years, there has been a great deal of research on
navigation tasks in indoor environments using deep reinforcement learning
agents. Most of these tasks use only visual information in the form of
first-person images to navigate to a single goal. More recently, tasks that
simultaneously use visual and auditory information to navigate to the sound
source and even navigation tasks with multiple goals instead of one have been
proposed. However, there has been no proposal for a generalized navigation task
combining these two types of tasks and using both visual and auditory
information in a situation where multiple sound sources are goals. In this
paper, we propose a new framework for this generalized task: multi-goal
audio-visual navigation. We first define the task in detail, and then we
investigate the difficulty of the multi-goal audio-visual navigation task
relative to the current navigation tasks by conducting experiments in various
situations. The research shows that multi-goal audio-visual navigation has the
difficulty of the implicit need to separate the sources of sound. Next, to
mitigate the difficulties in this new task, we propose a method named sound
direction map (SDM), which dynamically localizes multiple sound sources in a
learning-based manner while making use of past memories. Experimental results
show that the use of SDM significantly improves the performance of multiple
baseline methods, regardless of the number of goals.

<p class="mathjax">This study aims to proactively tackle misuse of large language models beyond
identification of machine-generated text. While existing methods focus on
detection, some malicious misuses demand tracing the adversary user for
counteracting them. To address this, we propose "Multi-bit Watermark through
Color-listing" (COLOR), embedding traceable multi-bit information during
language model generation. Leveraging the benefits of zero-bit watermarking
(Kirchenbauer et al., 2023a), COLOR enables extraction without model access,
on-the-fly embedding, and maintains text quality, while allowing zero-bit
detection all at the same time. Preliminary experiments demonstrates successful
embedding of 32-bit messages with 91.9% accuracy in moderate-length texts
($\sim$500 tokens). This work advances strategies to counter language model
misuse effectively.

<p class="mathjax">With appealing visual effects, kinetic typography (animated text) has
prevailed in movies, advertisements, and social media. However, it remains
challenging and time-consuming to craft its animation scheme. We propose an
automatic framework to transfer the animation scheme of a rigid body on a given
meme GIF to text in vector format. First, the trajectories of key points on the
GIF anchor are extracted and mapped to the text's control points based on local
affine transformation. Then the temporal positions of the control points are
optimized to maintain the text topology. We also develop an authoring tool that
allows intuitive human control in the generation process. A questionnaire study
provides evidence that the output results are aesthetically pleasing and well
preserve the animation patterns in the original GIF, where participants were
impressed by a similar emotional semantics of the original GIF. In addition, we
evaluate the utility and effectiveness of our approach through a workshop with
general users and designers.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies show that instruction tuning and learning from human feedback
improve the abilities of large language models (LMs) dramatically. While these
tuning methods can make models generate high-quality text, we conjecture that
more implicit cognitive biases may arise in these fine-tuned models. Our work
provides evidence that these fine-tuned models exhibit biases that were absent
or less pronounced in their pretrained predecessors. We examine the extent of
this phenomenon in three cognitive biases - the decoy effect, the certainty
effect, and the belief bias - all of which are known to influence human
decision-making and reasoning. Our findings highlight the presence of these
biases in various models, especially those that have undergone instruction
tuning, such as Flan-T5, GPT3.5, and GPT4. This research constitutes a step
toward comprehending cognitive biases in instruction-tuned LMs, which is
crucial for the development of more reliable and unbiased language models.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic emotion recognition is a hot topic with a wide range of
applications. Much work has been done in the area of automatic emotion
recognition in recent years. The focus has been mainly on using the
characteristics of a person such as speech, facial expression and pose for this
purpose. However, the processing of scene and semantic features for emotion
recognition has had limited exploration. In this paper, we propose to use
combined scene and semantic features, along with personal features, for
multi-modal emotion recognition. Scene features will describe the environment
or context in which the target person is operating. The semantic feature can
include objects that are present in the environment, as well as their
attributes and relationships with the target person. In addition, we use a
modified EmbraceNet to extract features from the images, which is trained to
learn both the body and pose features simultaneously. By fusing both body and
pose features, the EmbraceNet can improve the accuracy and robustness of the
model, particularly when dealing with partially missing data. This is because
having both body and pose features provides a more complete representation of
the subject in the images, which can help the model to make more accurate
predictions even when some parts of body are missing. We demonstrate the
efficiency of our method on the benchmark EMOTIC dataset. We report an average
precision of 40.39\% across the 26 emotion categories, which is a 5\%
improvement over previous approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The modern pervasiveness of large-scale deep neural networks (NNs) is driven
by their extraordinary performance on complex problems but is also plagued by
their sudden, unexpected, and often catastrophic failures, particularly on
challenging scenarios. Existing algorithms that provide risk-awareness to NNs
are complex and ad-hoc. Specifically, these methods require significant
engineering changes, are often developed only for particular settings, and are
not easily composable. Here we present capsa, a framework for extending models
with risk-awareness. Capsa provides a methodology for quantifying multiple
forms of risk and composing different algorithms together to quantify different
risk metrics in parallel. We validate capsa by implementing state-of-the-art
uncertainty estimation algorithms within the capsa framework and benchmarking
them on complex perception datasets. We demonstrate capsa's ability to easily
compose aleatoric uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty, and bias estimation
together in a single procedure, and show how this approach provides a
comprehensive awareness of NN risk.

range of terrains and environments, such as amphibians that can swim and walk
or birds that can fly and walk. This capability is extremely beneficial for
expanding the animal's habitat range and they can choose the most energy
efficient mode of locomotion in a given environment. The robotic biomimicry of
this multi-modal locomotion capability can be very challenging but offer the

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, saliency ranking has emerged as a challenging task focusing
on assessing the degree of saliency at instance-level. Being subjective, even
humans struggle to identify the precise order of all salient instances.
Previous approaches undertake the saliency ranking by directly sorting the rank
scores of salient instances, which have not explicitly resolved the inherent
ambiguities. To overcome this limitation, we propose the ranking by partition
paradigm, which segments unordered salient instances into partitions and then
ranks them based on the correlations among these partitions. The ranking by
partition paradigm alleviates ranking ambiguities in a general sense, as it
consistently improves the performance of other saliency ranking models.
Additionally, we introduce the Dense Pyramid Transformer (DPT) to enable global
cross-scale interactions, which significantly enhances feature interactions
with reduced computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms all existing methods. The code for our method is available
at \url{https://github.com/ssecv/PSR}.

<p class="mathjax">One of scenarios in data-sharing applications is that files are managed by
multiple owners, and the list of file owners may change dynamically. However,
most existing solutions to this problem rely on trusted third parties and have
complicated signature permission processes, resulting in additional overhead.
Therefore, we propose a verifiable data-sharing scheme (VDS-DM) that can
support dynamic multi-owner scenarios. We introduce a management entity that
combines linear secret-sharing technology, multi-owner signature generation,
and an aggregation technique to allow multi-owner file sharing. Without the
help of trusted third parties, VDS-DM can update file signatures for
dynamically changing file owners, which helps save communication overhead.
Moreover, users independently verify the integrity of files without resorting
to a third party. We analyse the security of VDS-DM through a security game.
Finally, we conduct enough simulation experiments and the outcomes of
experimental demonstrate the feasibility of VDS-DM.

develops a novel method for economic analysis of PV self-consumption using
battery storage based on an extension of the Screening Curve Method (SCM). The
SCM enables quick and intuitive estimation of the least-cost generation mix for
a target load curve and has been used for generation planning of a bulk power
system. In this paper, we generalize the framework of existing SCM to take into
account the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and apply it to the
problem of optimal sizing of PV and battery storage systems for a household.
Numerical studies are provided to verify the estimation accuracy of the

<p class="mathjax">Static analysis is a widely used technique in software engineering for
identifying and mitigating bugs. However, a significant hurdle lies in
achieving a delicate balance between precision and scalability. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, as recent advances demonstrate
remarkable capabilities in comprehending, generating, and even debugging code.
Yet, the logic of bugs can be complex and require sophisticated reasoning and a
large analysis scope spanning multiple functions. Therefore, at this point,
LLMs are better used in an assistive role to complement static analysis. In
this paper, we take a deep dive into the open space of LLM-assisted static
analysis, using use-before-initialization (UBI) bugs as a case study. To this
end, we develop LLift, a fully automated agent that interfaces with both a
static analysis tool and an LLM. By carefully designing the agent and the
prompts, we are able to overcome a number of challenges, including bug-specific
modeling, the large problem scope, the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, etc.
Tested in a real-world scenario analyzing nearly a thousand potential UBI bugs
produced by static analysis, LLift demonstrates an extremely potent capability,
showcasing a high precision (50%) and recall rate (100%). It even identified 13
previously unknown UBI bugs in the Linux kernel. This research paves the way
for new opportunities and methodologies in the use of LLMs for bug discovery in
extensive, real-world datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Cognitive load, the amount of mental effort required for task completion,
plays an important role in performance and decision-making outcomes, making its
classification and analysis essential in various sensitive domains. In this
paper, we present a new solution for the classification of cognitive load using
electroencephalogram (EEG). Our model uses a transformer architecture employing
transfer learning between emotions and cognitive load. We pre-train our model
using self-supervised masked autoencoding on emotion-related EEG datasets and
use transfer learning with both frozen weights and fine-tuning to perform
downstream cognitive load classification. To evaluate our method, we carry out
a series of experiments utilizing two publicly available EEG-based emotion
datasets, namely SEED and SEED-IV, for pre-training, while we use the CL-Drive
dataset for downstream cognitive load classification. The results of our
experiments show that our proposed approach achieves strong results and
outperforms conventional single-stage fully supervised learning. Moreover, we
perform detailed ablation and sensitivity studies to evaluate the impact of
different aspects of our proposed solution. This research contributes to the
growing body of literature in affective computing with a focus on cognitive
load, and opens up new avenues for future research in the field of cross-domain
transfer learning using self-supervised pre-training.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel approach to automatically synthesize a mathematical
representation of the control algorithms implemented in industrial
cyber-physical systems (CPS), given the embedded system binary. The output
model can be used by subject matter experts to assess the system's compliance
with the expected behavior and for a variety of forensic applications. Our
approach first performs static analysis on decompiled binary files of the
controller to create a sketch of the mathematical representation. Then, we
perform an evolutionary-based search to find the correct semantic for the
created representation, i.e., the control law. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the introduced approach in practice via three case studies conducted on two
real-life industrial CPS.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the efficient deployment and acceleration of powerful vision
transformers (ViTs) on resource-limited edge devices for providing multimedia
services have become attractive tasks. Although early exiting is a feasible
solution for accelerating inference, most works focus on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and transformer models in natural language processing
(NLP).Moreover, the direct application of early exiting methods to ViTs may
result in substantial performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we
systematically investigate the efficacy of early exiting in ViTs and point out
that the insufficient feature representations in shallow internal classifiers
and the limited ability to capture target semantic information in deep internal
classifiers restrict the performance of these methods. We then propose an early
exiting framework for general ViTs termed LGViT, which incorporates
heterogeneous exiting heads, namely, local perception head and global
aggregation head, to achieve an efficiency-accuracy trade-off. In particular,
we develop a novel two-stage training scheme, including end-to-end training and
self-distillation with the backbone frozen to generate early exiting ViTs,
which facilitates the fusion of global and local information extracted by the
two types of heads. We conduct extensive experiments using three popular ViT
backbones on three vision datasets. Results demonstrate that our LGViT can
achieve competitive performance with approximately 1.8 $\times$ speed-up.

<p class="mathjax">Animals and insects showcase remarkably robust and adept navigational
abilities, up to literally circumnavigating the globe. Primary progress in
robotics inspired by these natural systems has occurred in two areas: highly
theoretical computational neuroscience models, and handcrafted systems like
RatSLAM and NeuroSLAM. In this research, we present work bridging the gap
between the two, in the form of Multiscale Continuous Attractor Networks
(MCAN), that combine the multiscale parallel spatial neural networks of the
previous theoretical models with the real-world robustness of the
robot-targeted systems, to enable trajectory tracking over large velocity
ranges. To overcome the limitations of the reliance of previous systems on
hand-tuned parameters, we present a genetic algorithm-based approach for
automated tuning of these networks, substantially improving their usability. To
provide challenging navigational scale ranges, we open source a flexible
city-scale navigation simulator that adapts to any street network, enabling
high throughput experimentation. In extensive experiments using the city-scale
navigation environment and Kitti, we show that the system is capable of stable
dead reckoning over a wide range of velocities and environmental scales, where
a single-scale approach fails.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread adoption of Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving
distributed learning methodology, has been impeded by the challenge of high
communication overheads, typically arising from the transmission of large-scale
models. Existing adaptive quantization methods, designed to mitigate these
overheads, operate under the impractical assumption of uniform device
participation in every training round. Additionally, these methods are limited
in their adaptability due to the necessity of manual quantization level
selection and often overlook biases inherent in local devices' data, thereby
affecting the robustness of the global model. In response, this paper
introduces AQUILA (adaptive quantization of lazily-aggregated gradients), a
novel adaptive framework devised to effectively handle these issues, enhancing
the efficiency and robustness of FL. AQUILA integrates a sophisticated device
selection method that prioritizes the quality and usefulness of device updates.
Utilizing the exact global model stored by devices, it enables a more precise
device selection criterion, reduces model deviation, and limits the need for
hyperparameter adjustments. Furthermore, AQUILA presents an innovative
quantization criterion, optimized to improve communication efficiency while
assuring model convergence. Our experiments demonstrate that AQUILA
significantly decreases communication costs compared to existing methods, while
maintaining comparable model performance across diverse non-homogeneous FL
settings, such as Non-IID data and heterogeneous model architectures.

rotors and a helium balloon, called SBlimp. We propose a novel control strategy
that takes advantage of the natural stable attitude of the blimp to control
translational motion. Different from cascade controllers in the literature that
controls attitude to achieve desired translational motion, our approach
directly controls the linear velocity regardless of the heading orientation of
the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle swings during the translational motion.
We provide a planar analysis of the dynamic model, demonstrating stability for
our controller. Our design is evaluated in numerical simulations with different

<p class="mathjax">There has been significant progress in Masked Image Modeling (MIM). Existing
MIM methods can be broadly categorized into two groups based on the
reconstruction target: pixel-based and tokenizer-based approaches. The former
offers a simpler pipeline and lower computational cost, but it is known to be
biased toward high-frequency details. In this paper, we provide a set of
empirical studies to confirm this limitation of pixel-based MIM and propose a
new method that explicitly utilizes low-level features from shallow layers to
aid pixel reconstruction. By incorporating this design into our base method,
MAE, we reduce the wasted modeling capability of pixel-based MIM, improving its
convergence and achieving non-trivial improvements across various downstream
tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically
investigate multi-level feature fusion for isotropic architectures like the
standard Vision Transformer (ViT). Notably, when applied to a smaller model
(e.g., ViT-S), our method yields significant performance gains, such as 1.2\%
on fine-tuning, 2.8\% on linear probing, and 2.6\% on semantic segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents our solutions to the Algonauts Project 2023 Challenge. The
primary objective of the challenge revolves around employing computational
models to anticipate brain responses captured during participants' observation
of intricate natural visual scenes. The goal is to predict brain responses
across the entire visual brain, as it is the region where the most reliable
responses to images have been observed. We constructed an image-based brain
encoder through a two-step training process to tackle this challenge.
Initially, we created a pretrained encoder using data from all subjects. Next,
we proceeded to fine-tune individual subjects. Each step employed different
training strategies, such as different loss functions and objectives, to
introduce diversity. Ultimately, our solution constitutes an ensemble of
multiple unique encoders. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Asynchronous Federated Learning with Buffered Aggregation (FedBuff) is a
state-of-the-art algorithm known for its efficiency and high scalability.
However, it has a high communication cost, which has not been examined with
quantized communications. To tackle this problem, we present a new algorithm
(QAFeL), with a quantization scheme that establishes a shared "hidden" state
between the server and clients to avoid the error propagation caused by direct
quantization. This approach allows for high precision while significantly
reducing the data transmitted during client-server interactions. We provide
theoretical convergence guarantees for QAFeL and corroborate our analysis with
experiments on a standard benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning based methods have achieved significant success in the task of
single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, the majority of these methods
are focused on High-Definition/Standard-Definition (HD/SD) images, while
ignoring higher resolution images such as Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images.
With the increasing prevalence of UHD images captured by modern devices, in
this paper, we aim to address the problem of UHD SIRR. Specifically, we first
synthesize two large-scale UHD datasets, UHDRR4K and UHDRR8K. The UHDRR4K
dataset consists of $2,999$ and $168$ quadruplets of images for training and
testing respectively, and the UHDRR8K dataset contains $1,014$ and $105$
quadruplets. To the best of our knowledge, these two datasets are the first
largest-scale UHD datasets for SIRR. Then, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of six state-of-the-art SIRR methods using the proposed datasets.
Based on the results, we provide detailed discussions regarding the strengths
and limitations of these methods when applied to UHD images. Finally, we
present a transformer-based architecture named RRFormer for reflection removal.
RRFormer comprises three modules, namely the Prepossessing Embedding Module,
Self-attention Feature Extraction Module, and Multi-scale Spatial Feature
Extraction Module. These modules extract hypercolumn features, global and
partial attention features, and multi-scale spatial features, respectively. To
ensure effective training, we utilize three terms in our loss function: pixel
loss, feature loss, and adversarial loss. We demonstrate through experimental
results that RRFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the non-UHD
dataset and our proposed UHDRR datasets. The code and datasets are publicly
available at

to be a privacy protection method for training data. In contrast, attack

<p class="mathjax">Learning distance functions between complex objects, such as the Wasserstein
distance to compare point sets, is a common goal in machine learning
applications. However, functions on such complex objects (e.g., point sets and
graphs) are often required to be invariant to a wide variety of group actions
e.g. permutation or rigid transformation. Therefore, continuous and symmetric
product functions (such as distance functions) on such complex objects must
also be invariant to the product of such group actions. We call these functions
symmetric and factor-wise group invariant (or SFGI functions in short). In this
paper, we first present a general neural network architecture for approximating
SFGI functions. The main contribution of this paper combines this general
neural network with a sketching idea to develop a specific and efficient neural
network which can approximate the $p$-th Wasserstein distance between point
sets. Very importantly, the required model complexity is independent of the
sizes of input point sets. On the theoretical front, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first result showing that there exists a neural network
with the capacity to approximate Wasserstein distance with bounded model
complexity. Our work provides an interesting integration of sketching ideas for
geometric problems with universal approximation of symmetric functions. On the
empirical front, we present a range of results showing that our newly proposed
neural network architecture performs comparatively or better than other models
(including a SOTA Siamese Autoencoder based approach). In particular, our
neural network generalizes significantly better and trains much faster than the
SOTA Siamese AE. Finally, this line of investigation could be useful in
exploring effective neural network design for solving a broad range of
geometric optimization problems (e.g., $k$-means in a metric space).

<p class="mathjax">Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) localization refers to the problem of
determining the position of each of the agents in a WSN using noisy measurement
information. In many cases, such as in distance and bearing-based localization,
the measurement model is a nonlinear function of the agents' positions, leading
to pairwise interconnections between the agents. As the optimal solution for
the WSN localization problem is known to be computationally expensive in these
cases, an efficient approximation is desired. In this paper, we show that the
inherent sparsity in this problem can be exploited to greatly reduce the
computational effort of using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for large-scale
WSN localization. In the proposed method, which we call the Low-Bandwidth
Extended Kalman Filter (LB-EKF), the measurement information matrix is
converted into a banded matrix by relabeling (permuting the order of) the
vertices of the graph. Using a combination of theoretical analysis and
numerical simulations, it is shown that typical WSN configurations (which can
be modeled as random geometric graphs) can be localized in a scalable manner
using the proposed LB-EKF approach.

<p class="mathjax">A common way to evaluate the reliability of dimensionality reduction (DR)
embeddings is to quantify how well labeled classes form compact, mutually
separated clusters in the embeddings. This approach is based on the assumption
that the classes stay as clear clusters in the original high-dimensional space.
However, in reality, this assumption can be violated; a single class can be
fragmented into multiple separated clusters, and multiple classes can be merged
into a single cluster. We thus cannot always assure the credibility of the
evaluation using class labels. In this paper, we introduce two novel quality
measures -- Label-Trustworthiness and Label-Continuity (Label-T&amp;C) -- advancing
the process of DR evaluation based on class labels. Instead of assuming that
classes are well-clustered in the original space, Label-T&amp;C work by (1)
estimating the extent to which classes form clusters in the original and
embedded spaces and (2) evaluating the difference between the two. A
quantitative evaluation showed that Label-T&amp;C outperform widely used DR
evaluation measures (e.g., Trustworthiness and Continuity, Kullback-Leibler
divergence) in terms of the accuracy in assessing how well DR embeddings
preserve the cluster structure, and are also scalable. Moreover, we present
case studies demonstrating that Label-T&amp;C can be successfully used for
revealing the intrinsic characteristics of DR techniques and their
hyperparameters.

<p class="mathjax">Learning from positive and unlabeled data is known as positive-unlabeled (PU)
learning in literature and has attracted much attention in recent years. One
common approach in PU learning is to sample a set of pseudo-negatives from the
unlabeled data using ad-hoc thresholds so that conventional supervised methods
can be applied with both positive and negative samples. Owing to the label
uncertainty among the unlabeled data, errors of misclassifying unlabeled
positive samples as negative samples inevitably appear and may even accumulate
during the training processes. Those errors often lead to performance
degradation and model instability. To mitigate the impact of label uncertainty
and improve the robustness of learning with positive and unlabeled data, we
propose a new robust PU learning method with a training strategy motivated by
the nature of human learning: easy cases should be learned first. Similar
intuition has been utilized in curriculum learning to only use easier cases in
the early stage of training before introducing more complex cases.
Specifically, we utilize a novel ``hardness'' measure to distinguish unlabeled
samples with a high chance of being negative from unlabeled samples with large
label noise. An iterative training strategy is then implemented to fine-tune
the selection of negative samples during the training process in an iterative
manner to include more ``easy'' samples in the early stage of training.
Extensive experimental validations over a wide range of learning tasks show
that this approach can effectively improve the accuracy and stability of
learning with positive and unlabeled data. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Given the time and expense associated with bringing a drug to market,
numerous studies have been conducted to predict the properties of compounds
based on their structure using machine learning. Federated learning has been
applied to compound datasets to increase their prediction accuracy while
safeguarding potentially proprietary information. However, federated learning
is encumbered by low accuracy in not identically and independently distributed
(non-IID) settings, i.e., data partitioning has a large label bias, and is
considered unsuitable for compound datasets, which tend to have large label
bias. To address this limitation, we utilized an alternative method of
distributed machine learning to chemical compound data from open sources,
called data collaboration analysis (DC). We also proposed data collaboration
analysis using projection data (DCPd), which is an improved method that
utilizes auxiliary PubChem data. This improves the quality of individual
user-side data transformations for the projection data for the creation of
intermediate representations. The classification accuracy, i.e., area under the
curve in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and AUC in the
precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), of federated averaging (FedAvg), DC, and DCPd
was compared for five compound datasets. We determined that the machine
learning performance for non-IID settings was in the order of DCPd, DC, and
FedAvg, although they were almost the same in identically and independently
distributed (IID) settings. Moreover, the results showed that compared to other
methods, DCPd exhibited a negligible decline in classification accuracy in
experiments with different degrees of label bias. Thus, DCPd can address the
low performance in non-IID settings, which is one of the challenges of
federated learning.

<p class="mathjax">Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques inherently distort the original
structure of input high-dimensional data, producing imperfect low-dimensional
embeddings. Diverse distortion measures have thus been proposed to evaluate the
reliability of DR embeddings. However, implementing and executing distortion
measures in practice has so far been time-consuming and tedious. To address
this issue, we present ZADU, a Python library that provides distortion
measures. ZADU is not only easy to install and execute but also enables
comprehensive evaluation of DR embeddings through three key features. First,
the library covers a wide range of distortion measures. Second, it
automatically optimizes the execution of distortion measures, substantially
reducing the running time required to execute multiple measures. Last, the
library informs how individual points contribute to the overall distortions,
facilitating the detailed analysis of DR embeddings. By simulating a real-world
scenario of optimizing DR embeddings, we verify that our optimization scheme
substantially reduces the time required to execute distortion measures.
Finally, as an application of ZADU, we present another library called ZADUVis
that allows users to easily create distortion visualizations that depict the
extent to which each region of an embedding suffers from distortions.

<p class="mathjax">Visual clustering is a common perceptual task in scatterplots that supports
diverse analytics tasks (e.g., cluster identification). However, even with the
same scatterplot, the ways of perceiving clusters (i.e., conducting visual
clustering) can differ due to the differences among individuals and ambiguous
cluster boundaries. Although such perceptual variability casts doubt on the
reliability of data analysis based on visual clustering, we lack a systematic
way to efficiently assess this variability. In this research, we study
perceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, which we call Cluster
Ambiguity. To this end, we introduce CLAMS, a data-driven visual quality
measure for automatically predicting cluster ambiguity in monochrome
scatterplots. We first conduct a qualitative study to identify key factors that
affect the visual separation of clusters (e.g., proximity or size difference
between clusters). Based on study findings, we deploy a regression module that
estimates the human-judged separability of two clusters. Then, CLAMS predicts
cluster ambiguity by analyzing the aggregated results of all pairwise
separability between clusters that are generated by the module. CLAMS
outperforms widely-used clustering techniques in predicting ground truth
cluster ambiguity. Meanwhile, CLAMS exhibits performance on par with human
annotators. We conclude our work by presenting two applications for optimizing
and benchmarking data mining techniques using CLAMS. The interactive demo of
CLAMS is available at clusterambiguity.dev.

<p class="mathjax">Model selection is an integral problem of model based optimization techniques
such as Bayesian optimization (BO). Current approaches often treat model
selection as an estimation problem, to be periodically updated with
observations coming from the optimization iterations. In this paper, we propose
an alternative way to achieve both efficiently. Specifically, we propose a
novel way of integrating model selection and BO for the single goal of reaching
the function optima faster. The algorithm moves back and forth between BO in
the model space and BO in the function space, where the goodness of the
recommended model is captured by a score function and fed back, capturing how
well the model helped convergence in the function space. The score function is
derived in such a way that it neutralizes the effect of the moving nature of
the BO in the function space, thus keeping the model selection problem
stationary. This back and forth leads to quick convergence for both model
selection and BO in the function space. In addition to improved sample
efficiency, the framework outputs information about the black-box function.
Convergence is proved, and experimental results show significant improvement
compared to standard BO.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate the transfer of
models to target domains without labels. However, these methods necessitate a
labeled target validation set for hyper-parameter tuning and model selection.
In this paper, we aim to find an evaluation metric capable of assessing the
quality of a transferred model without access to target validation labels. We
begin with the metric based on mutual information of the model prediction.
Through empirical analysis, we identify three prevalent issues with this
metric: 1) It does not account for the source structure. 2) It can be easily
attacked. 3) It fails to detect negative transfer caused by the over-alignment
of source and target features. To address the first two issues, we incorporate
source accuracy into the metric and employ a new MLP classifier that is held
out during training, significantly improving the result. To tackle the final
issue, we integrate this enhanced metric with data augmentation, resulting in a
novel unsupervised UDA metric called the Augmentation Consistency Metric (ACM).
Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the shortcomings of previous
experiment settings and conduct large-scale experiments to validate the
effectiveness of our proposed metric. Furthermore, we employ our metric to
automatically search for the optimal hyper-parameter set, achieving superior
performance compared to manually tuned sets across four common benchmarks.
Codes will be available soon.

<p class="mathjax">Similar vulnerability repeats in real-world software products because of code
reuse, especially in wildly reused third-party code and libraries. Detecting
repeating vulnerabilities like 1-day and N-day vulnerabilities is an important
cyber security task. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art methods suffer from
poor performance because they detect patch existence instead of vulnerability
existence and infer the vulnerability signature directly from binary code. In
this paper, we propose VulMatch to extract precise vulnerability-related binary
instructions to generate the vulnerability-related signature. VulMatch detects
vulnerability existence based on binary signatures. Unlike previous approaches,
VulMatch accurately locates vulnerability-related instructions by utilizing
source and binary codes. Our experiments were conducted using over 1000
vulnerable instances across seven open-source projects. VulMatch significantly
outperformed the baseline tools Asm2vec and Palmtree. Besides the performance
advantages over the baseline tools, VulMatch offers a better feature by
providing explainable reasons during vulnerability detection. Our empirical
studies demonstrate that VulMatch detects fine-grained vulnerability that the
state-of-the-art tools struggle with. Our experiment on commercial firmware
demonstrates VulMatch is able to find vulnerabilities in real-world scenario.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new class of multilevel, adaptive, dual-space methods for
computing fast convolutional transforms. These methods can be applied to a
broad class of kernels, from the Green's functions for classical partial
differential equations (PDEs) to power functions and radial basis functions
such as those used in statistics and machine learning. The DMK (dual-space
multilevel kernel-splitting) framework uses a hierarchy of grids, computing a
smoothed interaction at the coarsest level, followed by a sequence of
corrections at finer and finer scales until the problem is entirely local, at
which point direct summation is applied.
<br />The main novelty of DMK is that the interaction at each scale is diagonalized
by a short Fourier transform, permitting the use of separation of variables,
but without requiring the FFT for its asymptotic performance. The DMK framework
substantially simplifies the algorithmic structure of the fast multipole method
(FMM) and unifies the FMM, Ewald summation, and multilevel summation, achieving
speeds comparable to the FFT in work per gridpoint, even in a fully adaptive
context.
<br />For continuous source distributions, the evaluation of local interactions is
further accelerated by approximating the kernel at the finest level as a sum of
Gaussians with a highly localized remainder. The Gaussian convolutions are
calculated using tensor product transforms, and the remainder term is
calculated using asymptotic methods. We illustrate the performance of DMK for
both continuous and discrete sources with extensive numerical examples in two
and three dimensions.

<p class="mathjax">Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques typically rely on a given
test-suite to guide the repair process. Apart from the need to provide test
oracles, this makes the produced patches prone to test data over-fitting. In
this work, instead of relying on test cases, we show how to automatically
repair memory safety issues, by leveraging static analysis (specifically
Incorrectness Separation Logic) to guide repair. Our proposed approach learns
what a desirable patch is by inspecting how close a patch is to fixing the bug
based on the feedback from incorrectness separation logic based static analysis
(specifically the Pulse analyser), and turning this information into a
distribution of probabilities over context free grammars. Furthermore, instead
of focusing on heuristics for reducing the search space of patches, we make
repair scalable by creating classes of equivalent patches according to the
effect they have on the symbolic heap, and then invoking the validation oracle
only once per class of patch equivalence. This allows us to efficiently
discover repairs even in the presence of a large pool of patch candidates
offered by our generic patch synthesis mechanism. Experimental evaluation of
our approach was conducted by repairing real world memory errors in OpenSSL,
swoole and other subjects. The evaluation results show the scalability and
efficacy of our approach in automatically producing high quality patches.

<p class="mathjax">Text-based VQA aims at answering questions by reading the text present in the
images. It requires a large amount of scene-text relationship understanding
compared to the VQA task. Recent studies have shown that the question-answer
pairs in the dataset are more focused on the text present in the image but less
importance is given to visual features and some questions do not require
understanding the image. The models trained on this dataset predict biased
answers due to the lack of understanding of visual context. For example, in
questions like "What is written on the signboard?", the answer predicted by the
model is always "STOP" which makes the model to ignore the image. To address
these issues, we propose a method to learn visual features (making V matter in
TextVQA) along with the OCR features and question features using VQA dataset as
external knowledge for Text-based VQA. Specifically, we combine the TextVQA
dataset and VQA dataset and train the model on this combined dataset. Such a
simple, yet effective approach increases the understanding and correlation
between the image features and text present in the image, which helps in the
better answering of questions. We further test the model on different datasets
and compare their qualitative and quantitative results.

<p class="mathjax">Online continual learning (CL) studies the problem of learning continuously
from a single-pass data stream while adapting to new data and mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Recently, by storing a small subset of old data,
replay-based methods have shown promising performance. Unlike previous methods
that focus on sample storage or knowledge distillation against catastrophic
forgetting, this paper aims to understand why the online learning models fail
to generalize well from a new perspective of shortcut learning. We identify
shortcut learning as the key limiting factor for online CL, where the learned
features may be biased, not generalizable to new tasks, and may have an adverse
impact on knowledge distillation. To tackle this issue, we present the online
prototype learning (OnPro) framework for online CL. First, we propose online
prototype equilibrium to learn representative features against shortcut
learning and discriminative features to avoid class confusion, ultimately
achieving an equilibrium status that separates all seen classes well while
learning new classes. Second, with the feedback of online prototypes, we devise
a novel adaptive prototypical feedback mechanism to sense the classes that are
easily misclassified and then enhance their boundaries. Extensive experimental
results on widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of OnPro over the state-of-the-art baseline methods. Source code is available

<p class="mathjax">Camouflaged object detection is a challenging task that aims to identify
objects that are highly similar to their background. Due to the powerful
noise-to-image denoising capability of denoising diffusion models, in this
paper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for camouflaged object detection,
termed diffCOD, a new framework that considers the camouflaged object
segmentation task as a denoising diffusion process from noisy masks to object
masks. Specifically, the object mask diffuses from the ground-truth masks to a
random distribution, and the designed model learns to reverse this noising
process. To strengthen the denoising learning, the input image prior is encoded
and integrated into the denoising diffusion model to guide the diffusion
process. Furthermore, we design an injection attention module (IAM) to interact
conditional semantic features extracted from the image with the diffusion noise
embedding via the cross-attention mechanism to enhance denoising learning.
Extensive experiments on four widely used COD benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared to the
existing 11 state-of-the-art methods, especially in the detailed texture
segmentation of camouflaged objects. Our code will be made publicly available
at: https://github.com/ZNan-Chen/diffCOD.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of eliciting compositional generalization
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) with a novel type of prompting
strategy. Compositional generalization empowers the LLMs to solve problems that
are harder than the ones they have seen (i.e., easy-to-hard generalization),
which is a critical reasoning capability of human-like intelligence. However,
even the current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with this form of
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose skills-in-context (SKiC) prompting,
which instructs LLMs how to compose basic skills to resolve more complex
problems. We find that it is crucial to demonstrate both the skills and the
compositional examples within the same prompting context. With as few as two
examplars, our SKiC prompting initiates strong synergies between skills and
their composition capabilities. Notably, it empowers LLMs to solve unseen
problems that require innovative skill compositions, achieving near-perfect
generalization on a broad range of challenging compositionality tasks.
Intriguingly, SKiC prompting unlocks the latent potential of LLMs, enabling
them to leverage pre-existing internal skills acquired during earlier
pretraining and alignment stages, even when these skills are not explicitly
presented in the prompting context. This results in the capability of LLMs to
solve unseen complex problems by activating and composing these internal
competencies.

<p class="mathjax">The 2-opt heuristic is a very simple local search heuristic for the traveling
salesperson problem. In practice it usually converges quickly to solutions
within a few percentages of optimality. In contrast to this, its running-time
is exponential and its approximation performance is poor in the worst case.
<br />Englert, R\"oglin, and V\"ocking (Algorithmica, 2014) provided a smoothed
analysis in the so-called one-step model in order to explain the performance of
2-opt on d-dimensional Euclidean instances, both in terms of running-time and
in terms of approximation ratio. However, translating their results to the
classical model of smoothed analysis, where points are perturbed by Gaussian
distributions with standard deviation sigma, yields only weak bounds.
<br />We prove bounds that are polynomial in n and 1/sigma for the smoothed
running-time with Gaussian perturbations. In addition, our analysis for
Euclidean distances is much simpler than the existing smoothed analysis.
<br />Furthermore, we prove a smoothed approximation ratio of O(log(1/sigma)). This
bound is almost tight, as we also provide a lower bound of Omega(log n/ loglog
n) for sigma = O(1/sqrt n). Our main technical novelty here is that, different
from existing smoothed analyses, we do not separately analyze objective values
of the global and local optimum on all inputs (which only allows for a bound of
O(1/sigma)), but simultaneously bound them on the same input.

<p class="mathjax">How can we apply human feedback into generative model? As answer of this
question, in this paper, we show the method applied on denoising problem and
domain adaptation using human feedback. Deep generative models have
demonstrated impressive results in image denoising. However, current image
denoising models often produce inappropriate results when applied to domains
different from the ones they were trained on. If there are `Good' and `Bad'
result for unseen data, how to raise up quality of `Bad' result. Most methods
use an approach based on generalization of model. However, these methods
require target image for training or adapting unseen domain. In this paper, to
adapting domain, we deal with non-target image for unseen domain, and improve
specific failed image. To address this, we propose a method for fine-tuning
inappropriate results generated in a different domain by utilizing human
feedback. First, we train a generator to denoise images using only the noisy
MNIST digit '0' images. The denoising generator trained on the source domain
leads to unintended results when applied to target domain images. To achieve
domain adaptation, we construct a noise-image denoising generated image data
set and train a reward model predict human feedback. Finally, we fine-tune the
generator on the different domain using the reward model with auxiliary loss
function, aiming to transfer denoising capabilities to target domain. Our
approach demonstrates the potential to efficiently fine-tune a generator
trained on one domain using human feedback from another domain, thereby
enhancing denoising abilities in different domains.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial for ensuring the safe
deployment of machine learning models in real-world applications. However,
existing OOD detection approaches primarily rely on the feature maps or the
full gradient space information to derive OOD scores neglecting the role of
most important parameters of the pre-trained network over in-distribution (ID)
data. In this study, we propose a novel approach called GradOrth to facilitate
OOD detection based on one intriguing observation that the important features
to identify OOD data lie in the lower-rank subspace of in-distribution (ID)
data. In particular, we identify OOD data by computing the norm of gradient
projection on the subspaces considered important for the in-distribution data.
A large orthogonal projection value (i.e. a small projection value) indicates
the sample as OOD as it captures a weak correlation of the ID data. This simple
yet effective method exhibits outstanding performance, showcasing a notable
reduction in the average false positive rate at a 95% true positive rate
(FPR95) of up to 8% when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Assigning importance weights to adversarial data has achieved great success
in training adversarially robust networks under limited model capacity.
However, existing instance-reweighted adversarial training (AT) methods heavily
depend on heuristics and/or geometric interpretations to determine those
importance weights, making these algorithms lack rigorous theoretical
justification/guarantee. Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial
training suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the
training distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much
more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in
this paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework,
which allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally
robust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the
robustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance
weights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function,
which allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence
guarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in
terms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the
robustness against attacks on the weakest data points. Codes will be available
soon.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by generalizing the
knowledge, i.e., visual and semantic relationships, obtained from seen classes,
where image augmentation techniques are commonly applied to improve the
generalization ability of a model. However, this approach can also cause
adverse effects on ZSL since the conventional augmentation techniques that
solely depend on single-label supervision is not able to maintain semantic
information and result in the semantic distortion issue consequently. In other
words, image argumentation may falsify the semantic (e.g., attribute)
information of an image. To take the advantage of image augmentations while
mitigating the semantic distortion issue, we propose a novel ZSL approach by
Harnessing Adversarial Samples (HAS). HAS advances ZSL through adversarial
training which takes into account three crucial aspects: (1) robust generation
by enforcing augmentations to be similar to negative classes, while maintaining
correct labels, (2) reliable generation by introducing a latent space
constraint to avert significant deviations from the original data manifold, and
(3) diverse generation by incorporating attribute-based perturbation by
adjusting images according to each semantic attribute's localization. Through
comprehensive experiments on three prominent zero-shot benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial samples approach in both ZSL
and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) scenarios. Our source code is

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement Learning can be applied to various tasks, and environments.
Many of these environments have a similar shared structure, which can be
exploited to improve RL performance on other tasks. Transfer learning can be
used to take advantage of this shared structure, by learning policies that are
transferable across different tasks and environments and can lead to more
efficient learning as well as improved performance on a wide range of tasks.
This work explores as well as compares the performance between RL models being
trained from the scratch and on different approaches of transfer learning.
Additionally, the study explores the performance of a model trained on multiple
game environments, with the goal of developing a universal game-playing agent
as well as transfer learning a pre-trained encoder using DQN, and training it
on the same game or a different game. Our DQN model achieves a mean episode
reward of 46.16 which even beats the human-level performance with merely 20k
episodes which is significantly lower than deepmind's 1M episodes. The achieved
mean rewards of 533.42 and 402.17 on the Assault and Space Invader environments
respectively, represent noteworthy performance on these challenging
environments.

<p class="mathjax">Natural language processing models are vulnerable to adversarial examples.
Previous textual adversarial attacks adopt gradients or confidence scores to
calculate word importance ranking and generate adversarial examples. However,
this information is unavailable in the real world. Therefore, we focus on a
more realistic and challenging setting, named hard-label attack, in which the
attacker can only query the model and obtain a discrete prediction label.
Existing hard-label attack algorithms tend to initialize adversarial examples
by random substitution and then utilize complex heuristic algorithms to
optimize the adversarial perturbation. These methods require a lot of model
queries and the attack success rate is restricted by adversary initialization.
In this paper, we propose a novel hard-label attack algorithm named LimeAttack,
which leverages a local explainable method to approximate word importance
ranking, and then adopts beam search to find the optimal solution. Extensive
experiments show that LimeAttack achieves the better attacking performance
compared with existing hard-label attack under the same query budget. In
addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of LimeAttack on large language models,
and results indicate that adversarial examples remain a significant threat to
large language models. The adversarial examples crafted by LimeAttack are
highly transferable and effectively improve model robustness in adversarial
training.

<p class="mathjax">Human body-pose estimation is a complex problem in computer vision. Recent
research interests have been widened specifically on the Sports, Yoga, and
Dance (SYD) postures for maintaining health conditions. The SYD pose categories
are regarded as a fine-grained image classification task due to the complex
movement of body parts. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have attained
significantly improved performance in solving various human body-pose
estimation problems. Though decent progress has been achieved in yoga postures
recognition using deep learning techniques, fine-grained sports, and dance
recognition necessitates ample research attention. However, no benchmark public
image dataset with sufficient inter-class and intra-class variations is
available yet to address sports and dance postures classification. To solve
this limitation, we have proposed two image datasets, one for 102 sport
categories and another for 12 dance styles. Two public datasets, Yoga-82 which
contains 82 classes and Yoga-107 represents 107 classes are collected for yoga
postures. These four SYD datasets are experimented with the proposed deep
model, SYD-Net, which integrates a patch-based attention (PbA) mechanism on top
of standard backbone CNNs. The PbA module leverages the self-attention
mechanism that learns contextual information from a set of uniform and
multi-scale patches and emphasizes discriminative features to understand the
semantic correlation among patches. Moreover, random erasing data augmentation
is applied to improve performance. The proposed SYD-Net has achieved
state-of-the-art accuracy on Yoga-82 using five base CNNs. SYD-Net's accuracy
on other datasets is remarkable, implying its efficiency. Our Sports-102 and
Dance-12 datasets are publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Parking occupancy estimation holds significant potential in facilitating
parking resource management and mitigating traffic congestion. Existing
approaches employ robotic systems to detect the occupancy status of individual
parking spaces and primarily focus on enhancing detection accuracy through
perception pipelines. However, these methods often overlook the crucial aspect
of robot path planning, which can hinder the accurate estimation of the entire
parking area. In light of these limitations, we introduce the problem of
informative path planning for parking occupancy estimation using autonomous
vehicles and formulate it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
(POMDP) task. Then, we develop an occupancy state transition model and
introduce a Bayes filter to estimate occupancy based on noisy sensor
measurements. Subsequently, we propose the Monte Carlo Bayes Filter Tree, a
computationally efficient algorithm that leverages progressive widening to
generate informative paths. We demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the benchmark methods in diverse simulation environments,
effectively striking a balance between optimality and computational efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Safety control of dynamical systems using barrier functions relies on knowing
the full state information. This paper introduces a novel approach for safety
control in uncertain Lagrangian systems with partial state information. The
proposed method combines the synthesis of a vector norm barrier function and a
dynamic output feedback safety controller to ensure robust safety enforcement.
The safety controller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under
uncertain dynamics and disturbances, providing reliable safety control. To
address the challenges associated with safety verification using partial state
information, a barrier function estimator is developed. This estimator employs
an identifier-based state estimator to obtain a state estimate that is affine
in the uncertain model parameters of the system. By incorporating a priori
knowledge of the limits of the uncertain model parameters and disturbances, the
state estimate provides a robust upper bound for the barrier function.
Comparative analysis with existing control barrier function based methods
demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach in enforcing safety
constraints under adverse conditions, including tight input constraints and the
utilization of estimated state information.

<p class="mathjax">With rising computational requirements modern automated vehicles (AVs) often
consider trade-offs between energy consumption and perception performance,
potentially jeopardizing their safe operation. Frame-dropping in
tracking-by-detection perception systems presents a promising approach,
although late traffic participant detection might be induced.
<br />In this paper, we extend our previous work on frame-dropping in
tracking-by-detection perception systems. We introduce an additional
event-based triggering mechanism using camera object detections to increase
both the system's efficiency, as well as its safety. Evaluating both single and
multi-modal tracking methods we show that late object detections are mitigated
while the potential for reduced energy consumption is significantly increased,
reaching nearly 60 Watt per reduced point in HOTA score.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative heterogeneous robot systems can greatly improve the efficiency
of target search and navigation tasks. In this paper, we design a heterogeneous
robot system consisting of a UAV and a UGV for search and rescue missions in
unknown environments. The system is able to search for targets and navigate to
them in a maze-like mine environment with the policies learned through deep
reinforcement learning algorithms. During the training process, if two robots
are trained simultaneously, the rewards related to their collaboration may not
be properly obtained. Hence, we introduce a multi-stage reinforcement learning
framework and a curiosity module to encourage agents to explore unvisited
environments. Experiments in simulation environments show that our framework
can train the heterogeneous robot system to achieve the search and navigation
with unknown target locations while existing baselines may not, and accelerate
the training speed.

<p class="mathjax">The harmonic balance method is the most commonly used method for solving
periodic solutions of nonlinear dynamic systems, but the high-order
approximation of nonlinear terms requires sophisticated formula derivation,
which limits its ultra-high accuracy. The authors' team proposed the
reconstruction harmonic balance (RHB) method through the equivalent
reconstruction of the frequency domain nonlinear quantity in the time domain,
which settled the problem of ultra-high-order calculation of the classical
harmonic balance method. However, both methods require the dynamical system to
be polynomial nonlinear, and cannot be directly used to solve the
quasi-periodic solution of the nonlinear system. In view of the above problems,
this paper proposes a computational method that combines the RHB method and the
recast technique for complex nonlinear systems. First, the general nonlinear
problem is non-destructively recast into a polynomial nonlinear system, and
then the RHB method is used for high-precision solutions. Aiming at computing
the quasi-periodic response, the RHB method based on the idea of "supplemental
frequency" is derived. By optimizing and selecting base frequencies, the fast
and accurate capture of quasi-periodic response is achieved. The typical
systems such as nonlinear pendulum, relativistic harmonic oscillator, and
nonlinear coupling asymmetric pendulum are selected for simulation. The
simulation results show that the accuracy of the RHB-recast method for solving
nonpolynomial nonlinear systems is on the order of 10^(-12), reaching the
computer accuracy, far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. The supplemental
frequency RHB method achieves the efficient solution of quasi-periodic
problems.

<p class="mathjax">Given a graph $G$, the $k$-hop dominating set problem asks for a vertex
subset $D_k$ such that every vertex of $G$ is in distance at most $k$ to some
vertex in $D_k$ ($k\in \mathbb{N}$). For $k=1$, this corresponds to the
classical dominating set problem in graphs.
<br />We study the $k$-hop dominating set problem in grid graphs (motivated by
generalized guard sets in polyominoes). We show that the VC dimension of this
problem is 3 in grid graphs without holes, and 4 in general grid graphs.
Furthermore, we provide a reduction from planar monotone 3SAT, thereby showing
that the problem is NP-complete even in thin grid graphs (i.e., grid graphs
that do not a contain an induced $C_4$). Complementary, we present a
linear-time $4$-approximation algorithm for $2$-thin grid graphs (which do not
contain a $3\times 3$-grid subgraph) for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$.

<p class="mathjax">As AI and machine-learned software are used increasingly for making decisions
that affect humans, it is imperative that they remain fair and unbiased in
their decisions. To complement design-time bias mitigation measures, runtime
verification techniques have been introduced recently to monitor the
algorithmic fairness of deployed systems. Previous monitoring techniques assume
full observability of the states of the (unknown) monitored system. Moreover,
they can monitor only fairness properties that are specified as arithmetic
expressions over the probabilities of different events. In this work, we extend
fairness monitoring to systems modeled as partially observed Markov chains
(POMC), and to specifications containing arithmetic expressions over the
expected values of numerical functions on event sequences. The only assumptions
we make are that the underlying POMC is aperiodic and starts in the stationary
distribution, with a bound on its mixing time being known. These assumptions
enable us to estimate a given property for the entire distribution of possible
executions of the monitored POMC, by observing only a single execution. Our
monitors observe a long run of the system and, after each new observation,
output updated PAC-estimates of how fair or biased the system is. The monitors
are computationally lightweight and, using a prototype implementation, we
demonstrate their effectiveness on several real-world examples.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous flying robots, such as multirotors, often rely on deep learning
models that makes predictions based on a camera image, e.g. for pose
estimation. These models can predict surprising results if applied to input
images outside the training domain. This fault can be exploited by adversarial
attacks, for example, by computing small images, so-called adversarial patches,
that can be placed in the environment to manipulate the neural network's
prediction. We introduce flying adversarial patches, where multiple images are
mounted on at least one other flying robot and therefore can be placed anywhere
in the field of view of a victim multirotor. By introducing the attacker
robots, the system is extended to an adversarial multi-robot system. For an
effective attack, we compare three methods that simultaneously optimize
multiple adversarial patches and their position in the input image. We show
that our methods scale well with the number of adversarial patches. Moreover,
we demonstrate physical flights with two robots, where we employ a novel attack
policy that uses the computed adversarial patches to kidnap a robot that was
supposed to follow a human.

<p class="mathjax">The deep neural network has attained significant efficiency in image
recognition. However, it has vulnerable recognition robustness under extensive
data uncertainty in practical applications. The uncertainty is attributed to
the inevitable ambient noise and, more importantly, the possible adversarial
attack. Dynamic methods can effectively improve the defense initiative in the
arms race of attack and defense of adversarial examples. Different from the
previous dynamic method depend on input or decision, this work explore the
dynamic attributes in model level through dynamic ensemble selection technology
to further protect the model from white-box attacks and improve the robustness.
Specifically, in training phase the Dirichlet distribution is apply as prior of
sub-models' predictive distribution, and the diversity constraint in parameter
space is introduced under the lightweight sub-models to construct alternative
ensembel model spaces. In test phase, the certain sub-models are dynamically
selected based on their rank of uncertainty value for the final prediction to
ensure the majority accurate principle in ensemble robustness and accuracy.
Compared with the previous dynamic method and staic adversarial traning model,
the presented approach can achieve significant robustness results without
damaging accuracy by combining dynamics and diversity property.

<p class="mathjax">Learning the Green's function using deep learning models enables to solve
different classes of partial differential equations. A practical limitation of
using deep learning for the Green's function is the repeated computationally
expensive Monte-Carlo integral approximations. We propose to learn the Green's
function by low-rank decomposition, which results in a novel architecture to
remove redundant computations by separate learning with domain data for
evaluation and Monte-Carlo samples for integral approximation. Using
experiments we show that the proposed method improves computational time
compared to MOD-Net while achieving comparable accuracy compared to both PINNs
and MOD-Net.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, remarkable progress has been made in automated task-solving through
the use of multi-agents driven by large language models (LLMs). However,
existing works primarily focuses on simple tasks lacking exploration and
investigation in complicated tasks mainly due to the hallucination problem.
This kind of hallucination gets amplified infinitely as multiple intelligent
agents interact with each other, resulting in failures when tackling
complicated problems.Therefore, we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative framework
that infuses effective human workflows as a meta programming approach into
LLM-driven multi-agent collaboration. In particular, MetaGPT first encodes
Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts, fostering structured
coordination. And then, it further mandates modular outputs, bestowing agents
with domain expertise paralleling human professionals to validate outputs and
reduce compounded errors. In this way, MetaGPT leverages the assembly line work
model to assign diverse roles to various agents, thus establishing a framework
that can effectively and cohesively deconstruct complex multi-agent
collaborative problems. Our experiments conducted on collaborative software
engineering tasks illustrate MetaGPT's capability in producing comprehensive
solutions with higher coherence relative to existing conversational and
chat-based multi-agent systems. This underscores the potential of incorporating
human domain knowledge into multi-agents, thus opening up novel avenues for
grappling with intricate real-world challenges. The GitHub repository of this
project is made publicly available on: https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT

<p class="mathjax">Open-world instance-level scene understanding aims to locate and recognize
unseen object categories that are not present in the annotated dataset. This
task is challenging because the model needs to both localize novel 3D objects
and infer their semantic categories. A key factor for the recent progress in 2D
open-world perception is the availability of large-scale image-text pairs from
the Internet, which cover a wide range of vocabulary concepts. However, this
success is hard to replicate in 3D scenarios due to the scarcity of 3D-text
pairs. To address this challenge, we propose to harness pre-trained
vision-language (VL) foundation models that encode extensive knowledge from
image-text pairs to generate captions for multi-view images of 3D scenes. This
allows us to establish explicit associations between 3D shapes and
semantic-rich captions. Moreover, to enhance the fine-grained visual-semantic
representation learning from captions for object-level categorization, we
design hierarchical point-caption association methods to learn semantic-aware
embeddings that exploit the 3D geometry between 3D points and multi-view
images. In addition, to tackle the localization challenge for novel classes in
the open-world setting, we develop debiased instance localization, which
involves training object grouping modules on unlabeled data using
instance-level pseudo supervision. This significantly improves the
generalization capabilities of instance grouping and thus the ability to
accurately locate novel objects. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D
semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks, covering indoor and
outdoor scenes across three datasets. Our method outperforms baseline methods
by a significant margin in semantic segmentation (e.g. 34.5%$\sim$65.3%),
instance segmentation (e.g. 21.8%$\sim$54.0%) and panoptic segmentation (e.g.
14.7%$\sim$43.3%). Code will be available.

<p class="mathjax">We show the first conditionally optimal deterministic algorithm for
$3$-coloring forests in the low-space massively parallel computation (MPC)
model. Our algorithm runs in $O(\log \log n)$ rounds and uses optimal global
space. The best previous algorithm requires $4$ colors [Ghaffari, Grunau, Jin,
DISC'20] and is randomized, while our algorithm are inherently deterministic.
<br />Our main technical contribution is an $O(\log \log n)$-round algorithm to
compute a partition of the forest into $O(\log n)$ ordered layers such that
every node has at most two neighbors in the same or higher layers. Similar
decompositions are often used in the area and we believe that this result is of
independent interest. Our results also immediately yield conditionally optimal
deterministic algorithms for maximal independent set and maximal matching for
forests, matching the state of the art [Giliberti, Fischer, Grunau, SPAA'23].
In contrast to their solution, our algorithms are not based on derandomization,
and are arguably simpler.

<p class="mathjax">Given a composite image, image harmonization aims to adjust the foreground
illumination to be consistent with background. Previous methods have explored
transforming foreground features to achieve competitive performance. In this
work, we show that using global information to guide foreground feature
transformation could achieve significant improvement. Besides, we propose to
transfer the foreground-background relation from real images to composite
images, which can provide intermediate supervision for the transformed encoder
features. Additionally, considering the drawbacks of existing harmonization
datasets, we also contribute a ccHarmony dataset which simulates the natural
illumination variation. Extensive experiments on iHarmony4 and our contributed
dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our ccHarmony dataset is
released at https://github.com/bcmi/Image-Harmonization-Dataset-ccHarmony.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple-antenna technologies are advancing towards large-scale aperture
sizes and extremely high frequencies, leading to the emergence of near-field
communications (NFC) in future wireless systems. To this context, we
investigate the degree of freedom (DoF) in near-field multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We consider both spatially discrete (SPD)
antennas and continuous aperture (CAP) antennas. Additionally, we explore three
important DoF-related performance metrics and examine their relationships with
the classic DoF. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of NFC over
far-field communications (FFC) in terms of providing increased spatial DoFs. We
also identify promising research directions for NFC from a DoF perspective.

<p class="mathjax">Deviations from the approved design or processes during mass production can
lead to unforeseen risks. However, these changes are sometimes necessary due to
changes in the product design characteristics or an adaptation in the
manufacturing process. A major challenge is to identify these risks early in
the workflow so that failures leading to warranty claims can be avoided. We
developed Fountain as a contextual assistant integrated in the deviation
management workflow that helps in identifying the risks based on the
description of the existing design and process criteria and the proposed
deviation. In the manufacturing context, it is important that the assistant
provides recommendations that are explainable and consistent. We achieve this
through a combination of the following two components 1) language models
finetuned for domain specific semantic similarity and, 2) knowledge
representation in the form of a property graph derived from the bill of
materials, Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and prior failures reported
by customers. Here, we present the nuances of selecting and adapting pretrained
language models for an engineering domain, continuous model updates based on
user interaction with the contextual assistant and creating the causal chain
for explainable recommendations based on the knowledge representation.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the model adaptation is feasible using
moderate computational infrastructure already available to most engineering
teams in manufacturing organizations and inference can be performed on standard
CPU only instances for integration with existing applications making these
methods easily deployable.

<p class="mathjax">Media reports show an alarming increase of data breaches at providers of
cybersecurity products and services. Since the exposed records may reveal
security-relevant data, such incidents cause undue burden and create the risk
of re-victimization to individuals whose personal data gets exposed. In pursuit
of examining a broad spectrum of the downstream effects on victims, we surveyed
104 persons who purchased specialized devices for the secure storage of
crypto-assets and later fell victim to a breach of customer data. Our case
study reveals common nuisances (i.e., spam, scams, phishing e-mails) as well as
previously unseen attack vectors (e.g., involving tampered devices), which are
possibly tied to the breach. A few victims report losses of digital assets as a
form of the harm. We find that our participants exhibit heightened safety
concerns, appear skeptical about litigation efforts, and demonstrate the
ability to differentiate between the quality of the security product and the
circumstances of the breach. We derive implications for the cybersecurity
industry at large, and point out methodological challenges in data breach
research.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of image harmonization is adjusting the foreground appearance in a
composite image to make the whole image harmonious. To construct paired
training images, existing datasets adopt different ways to adjust the
illumination statistics of foregrounds of real images to produce synthetic
composite images. However, different datasets have considerable domain gap and
the performances on small-scale datasets are limited by insufficient training
data. In this work, we explore learnable augmentation to enrich the
illumination diversity of small-scale datasets for better harmonization
performance. In particular, our designed SYthetic COmposite Network (SycoNet)
takes in a real image with foreground mask and a random vector to learn
suitable color transformation, which is applied to the foreground of this real
image to produce a synthetic composite image. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learnable augmentation for image
harmonization. The code of SycoNet is released at

<p class="mathjax">Shape completion, i.e., predicting the complete geometry of an object from a
partial observation, is highly relevant for several downstream tasks, most
notably robotic manipulation. When basing planning or prediction of real grasps
on object shape reconstruction, an indication of severe geometric uncertainty
is indispensable. In particular, there can be an irreducible uncertainty in
extended regions about the presence of entire object parts when given ambiguous
object views. To treat this important case, we propose two novel methods for
predicting such uncertain regions as straightforward extensions of any method
for predicting local spatial occupancy, one through postprocessing occupancy
scores, the other through direct prediction of an uncertainty indicator. We
compare these methods together with two known approaches to probabilistic shape
completion. Moreover, we generate a dataset, derived from ShapeNet, of
realistically rendered depth images of object views with ground-truth
annotations for the uncertain regions. We train on this dataset and test each
method in shape completion and prediction of uncertain regions for known and
novel object instances and on synthetic and real data. While direct uncertainty
prediction is by far the most accurate in the segmentation of uncertain
regions, both novel methods outperform the two baselines in shape completion
and uncertain region prediction, and avoiding the predicted uncertain regions
increases the quality of grasps for all tested methods. Web:

<p class="mathjax">A polyhedral surface~$\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with convex polygons as
faces is a side-contact representation of a graph~$G$ if there is a bijection
between the vertices of $G$ and the faces of~$\mathcal{C}$ such that the
polygons of adjacent vertices are exactly the polygons sharing an entire common
side in~$\mathcal{C}$.
<br />We show that $K_{3,8}$ has a side-contact representation but $K_{3,250}$ has
not. The latter result implies that the number of edges of a graph with
side-contact representation and $n$ vertices is bounded by $O(n^{5/3})$.

<p class="mathjax">Dual active bridge (DAB) converter is the key enabler in many popular
applications such as wireless charging, electric vehicle and renewable energy.
ZVS range and efficiency are two significant performance indicators for DAB
converter. To obtain the desired ZVS and efficiency performance, modulation
should be carefully designed. Hybrid modulation considers several single
modulation strategies to achieve good comprehensive performance.
Conventionally, to design a hybrid modulation, harmonic approach or piecewise
approach is used, but they suffer from time-consuming model building process
and inaccuracy. Therefore, an artificial-intelligence-based hybrid extended
phase shift (HEPS) modulation is proposed. Generally, the HEPS modulation is
developed in an automated fashion, which alleviates cumbersome model building
process while keeping high model accuracy. In HEPS modulation, two EPS
strategies are considered to realize optimal efficiency with full ZVS operation
over entire operating ranges. Specifically, to build data-driven models of ZVS
and efficiency performance, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which is a
state-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithm, is adopted. Afterwards, particle
swarm optimization with state-based adaptive velocity limit (PSO-SAVL) is
utilized to select the best EPS strategy and optimize modulation parameters.
With 1 kW hardware experiments, the feasibility of HEPS has been verified,
achieving optimal efficiency with maximum of 97.1% and full-range ZVS
operation.

<p class="mathjax">The dual active bridge (DAB) converter has been popular in many applications
for its outstanding power density and bidirectional power transfer capacity. Up
to now, triple phase shift (TPS) can be considered as one of the most advanced
modulation techniques for DAB converter. It can widen zero voltage switching
range and improve power efficiency significantly. Currently, current stress of
the DAB converter has been an important performance indicator when TPS
modulation is applied for smaller size and higher efficiency. However, to
minimize the current stress when the DAB converter is under TPS modulation, two
difficulties exist in analysis process and realization process, respectively.
Firstly, three degrees of modulation variables in TPS modulation bring
challenges to the analysis of current stress in different operating modes. This
analysis and deduction process leads to heavy computational burden and also
suffers from low accuracy. Secondly, to realize TPS modulation, if a lookup
table is adopted after the optimization of modulation variables, modulation
performance will be unsatisfactory because of the discrete nature of lookup
table. Therefore, an AI-based TPS modulation (AI-TPSM) strategy is proposed in
this paper. Neural network (NN) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) are utilized
to deal with the two difficulties mentioned above. With the proposed AI-TPSM,
the optimization of TPS modulation for minimized current stress will enjoy high
degree of automation which can relieve engineers' working burden and improve
accuracy. In the end of this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed AI-TPSM
has been experimentally verified with a 1 kW prototype.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic flow prediction (TFP) is a fundamental problem of the Intelligent
Transportation System (ITS), as it models the latent spatial-temporal
dependency of traffic flow for potential congestion prediction. Recent
graph-based models with multiple kinds of attention mechanisms have achieved
promising performance. However, existing methods for traffic flow prediction
tend to inherit the bias pattern from the dataset and lack interpretability. To
this end, we propose a Counterfactual Graph Transformer (CGT) model with an
instance-level explainer (e.g., finding the important subgraphs) specifically
designed for TFP. We design a perturbation mask generator over input sensor
features at the time dimension and the graph structure on the graph transformer
module to obtain spatial and temporal counterfactual explanations. By searching
the optimal perturbation masks on the input data feature and graph structures,
we can obtain the concise and dominant data or graph edge links for the
subsequent TFP task. After re-training the utilized graph transformer model
after counterfactual perturbation, we can obtain improved and interpretable
traffic flow prediction. Extensive results on three real-world public datasets
show that CGT can produce reliable explanations and is promising for traffic
flow prediction.

<p class="mathjax">An event-based camera outputs an event whenever a change in scene brightness
of a preset magnitude is detected at a particular pixel location in the sensor
plane. The resulting sparse and asynchronous output coupled with the high
dynamic range and temporal resolution of this novel camera motivate the study
of event-based cameras for navigation and landing applications. However, the
lack of real-world and synthetic datasets to support this line of research has
limited its consideration for onboard use. This paper presents a methodology
and a software pipeline for generating event-based vision datasets from optimal
landing trajectories during the approach of a target body. We construct
sequences of photorealistic images of the lunar surface with the Planet and
Asteroid Natural Scene Generation Utility at different viewpoints along a set
of optimal descent trajectories obtained by varying the boundary conditions.
The generated image sequences are then converted into event streams by means of
an event-based camera emulator. We demonstrate that the pipeline can generate
realistic event-based representations of surface features by constructing a
dataset of 500 trajectories, complete with event streams and motion field
ground truth data. We anticipate that novel event-based vision datasets can be
generated using this pipeline to support various spacecraft pose reconstruction
problems given events as input, and we hope that the proposed methodology would
attract the attention of researchers working at the intersection of
neuromorphic vision and guidance navigation and control.

<p class="mathjax">End-to-end autonomous driving aims to build a fully differentiable system
that takes raw sensor data as inputs and directly outputs the planned
trajectory or control signals of the ego vehicle. State-of-the-art methods
usually follow the `Teacher-Student' paradigm. The Teacher model uses
privileged information (ground-truth states of surrounding agents and map
elements) to learn the driving strategy. The student model only has access to
raw sensor data and conducts behavior cloning on the data collected by the
teacher model. By eliminating the noise of the perception part during planning
learning, state-of-the-art works could achieve better performance with
significantly less data compared to those coupled ones.
<br />However, under the current Teacher-Student paradigm, the student model still
needs to learn a planning head from scratch, which could be challenging due to
the redundant and noisy nature of raw sensor inputs and the casual confusion
issue of behavior cloning. In this work, we aim to explore the possibility of
directly adopting the strong teacher model to conduct planning while letting
the student model focus more on the perception part. We find that even equipped
with a SOTA perception model, directly letting the student model learn the
required inputs of the teacher model leads to poor driving performance, which
comes from the large distribution gap between predicted privileged inputs and
the ground-truth.
<br />To this end, we propose DriveAdapter, which employs adapters with the feature
alignment objective function between the student (perception) and teacher
(planning) modules. Additionally, since the pure learning-based teacher model
itself is imperfect and occasionally breaks safety rules, we propose a method
of action-guided feature learning with a mask for those imperfect teacher
features to further inject the priors of hand-crafted rules into the learning
process.

<p class="mathjax">Hallucinations in text generation occur when the system produces text that is
not grounded in the input. In this work, we tackle the problem of
hallucinations in neural chart summarization. Our analysis shows that the
target side of chart summarization training datasets often contains additional
information, leading to hallucinations. We propose a natural language inference

evaluation that our method significantly reduces hallucinations. We also found
that shortening long-distance dependencies in the input sequence and adding

<p class="mathjax">Image-grounded dialogue systems benefit greatly from integrating visual
information, resulting in high-quality response generation. However, current
models struggle to effectively utilize such information in zero-resource
scenarios, mainly due to the disparity between image and text modalities. To
overcome this challenge, we propose an innovative multimodal framework, called
ZRIGF, which assimilates image-grounded information for dialogue generation in
zero-resource situations. ZRIGF implements a two-stage learning strategy,
comprising contrastive pre-training and generative pre-training. Contrastive
pre-training includes a text-image matching module that maps images and texts
into a unified encoded vector space, along with a text-assisted masked image
modeling module that preserves pre-training visual features and fosters further
multimodal feature alignment. Generative pre-training employs a multimodal
fusion module and an information transfer module to produce insightful
responses based on harmonized multimodal representations. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on both text-based and image-grounded dialogue datasets
demonstrate ZRIGF's efficacy in generating contextually pertinent and
informative responses. Furthermore, we adopt a fully zero-resource scenario in
the image-grounded dialogue dataset to demonstrate our framework's robust
generalization capabilities in novel domains. The code is available at
https://github.com/zhangbo-nlp/ZRIGF.

<p class="mathjax">Constructing supervised machine learning models for real-world video analysis
require substantial labeled data, which is costly to acquire due to scarce
domain expertise and laborious manual inspection. While data programming shows
promise in generating labeled data at scale with user-defined labeling
functions, the high dimensional and complex temporal information in videos
poses additional challenges for effectively composing and evaluating labeling
functions. In this paper, we propose VideoPro, a visual analytics approach to
support flexible and scalable video data programming for model steering with
reduced human effort. We first extract human-understandable events from videos
using computer vision techniques and treat them as atomic components of
labeling functions. We further propose a two-stage template mining algorithm
that characterizes the sequential patterns of these events to serve as labeling
function templates for efficient data labeling. The visual interface of
VideoPro facilitates multifaceted exploration, examination, and application of
the labeling templates, allowing for effective programming of video data at
scale. Moreover, users can monitor the impact of programming on model
performance and make informed adjustments during the iterative programming
process. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach with
two case studies and expert interviews.

<p class="mathjax">The success of graph neural network-based models (GNNs) has significantly
advanced recommender systems by effectively modeling users and items as a
bipartite, undirected graph. However, many original graph-based works often
adopt results from baseline papers without verifying their validity for the
specific configuration under analysis. Our work addresses this issue by
focusing on the replicability of results. We present a code that successfully
replicates results from six popular and recent graph recommendation models
(NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF) on three common benchmark
datasets (Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). Additionally, we compare these
graph models with traditional collaborative filtering models that historically
performed well in offline evaluations. Furthermore, we extend our study to two
new datasets (Allrecipes and BookCrossing) that lack established setups in
existing literature. As the performance on these datasets differs from the
previous benchmarks, we analyze the impact of specific dataset characteristics
on recommendation accuracy. By investigating the information flow from users'
neighborhoods, we aim to identify which models are influenced by intrinsic
features in the dataset structure. The code to reproduce our experiments is
available at: https://github.com/sisinflab/Graph-RSs-Reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">Online science dissemination has quickly become crucial in promoting
scholars' work. Recent literature has demonstrated a lack of visibility for
women's research, where women's articles receive fewer academic citations than
men's. The informetric and scientometric community has briefly examined
gender-based inequalities in online visibility. However, the link between
online sharing of scientific work and citation impact for teams with different
gender compositions remains understudied. Here we explore whether online
visibility is helping women overcome the gender-based citation penalty. Our
analyses cover the three broad research areas of Computer Science, Engineering,
and Social Sciences, which have different gender representation, adoption of
online science dissemination practices, and citation culture. We create a
quasi-experimental setting by applying Coarsened Exact Matching, which enables
us to isolate the effects of team gender composition and online visibility on
the number of citations. We find that online visibility positively affects
citations across research areas, while team gender composition interacts
differently with visibility in these research areas. Our results provide
essential insights into gendered citation patterns and online visibility,
inviting informed discussions about decreasing the citation gap.

<p class="mathjax">Near MDS (NMDS) codes are closely related to interesting objects in finite
geometry and have nice applications in combinatorics and cryptography. But
there are many unsolved problems about construction of NMDS codes. In this
paper, by using symmetrical orthogonal arrays (OAs), we construct a lot of
NMDS, $m$-MDS and almost extremal NMDS codes. We establish a relation between
asymmetrical OAs and quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) over mixed
alphabets. Since quantum maximum distance separable (QMDS) codes over mixed
alphabets with the dimension equal to one have not been found in all the
literature so far, the definition of a near quantum maximum distance separable
(NQMDS) code over mixed alphabets is proposed. By using asymmetrical OAs, we
obtain many such codes.

<p class="mathjax">Multidimensional Voronoi constellations (VCs) are shown to be more
power-efficient than quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats given the
same uncoded bit error rate, and also have higher achievable information rates.
However, a coded modulation scheme to sustain these gains after forward error
correction (FEC) coding is still lacking. This paper designs coded modulation
schemes with soft-decision FEC codes for VCs, including bit-interleaved coded
modulation (BICM) and multilevel coded modulation (MLCM), together with three
bit-to-integer mapping algorithms and log-likelihood ratio calculation
algorithms. Simulation results show that VCs can achieve up to 1.84 dB
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains over QAM with BICM, and up to 0.99 dB SNR
gains over QAM with MLCM for the additive white Gaussian noise channel, with a
surprisingly low complexity.

<p class="mathjax">As a special type of mobile ad hoc network (MANET), the flying ad hoc network
(FANET) has the potential to enable a variety of emerging applications in both
civilian wireless communications (e.g., 5G and 6G) and the defense industry.
The routing protocol plays a pivotal role in FANET. However, when designing the
routing protocol for FANET, it is conventionally assumed that the aerial nodes
move randomly. This is clearly inappropriate for a mission-oriented FANET
(MO-FANET), in which the aerial nodes typically move toward a given destination
from given departure point(s), possibly along a roughly deterministic flight
path while maintaining a well-established formation, in order to carry out
certain missions. In this paper, a novel cyber-physical routing protocol
exploiting the particular mobility pattern of an MO-FANET is proposed based on
cross-disciplinary integration, which makes full use of the mission-determined
trajectory dynamics to construct the time sequence of rejoining and separating,
as well as the adjacency matrix for each node, as prior information. Compared
with the existing representative routing protocols used in FANETs, our protocol
achieves a higher packet-delivery ratio (PDR) at the cost of even lower
overhead and lower average end-to-end latency, while maintaining a reasonably
moderate and stable network jitter, as demonstrated by extensive ns-3-based
simulations assuming realistic configurations in an MO-FANET.

<p class="mathjax">Performing automatic reformulations of a user's query is a popular paradigm
used in information retrieval (IR) for improving effectiveness -- as
exemplified by the pseudo-relevance feedback approaches, which expand the query
in order to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem. Recent advancements in
generative language models have demonstrated their ability in generating
responses that are relevant to a given prompt. In light of this success, we
seek to study the capacity of such models to perform query reformulation and
how they compare with long-standing query reformulation methods that use
pseudo-relevance feedback. In particular, we investigate two representative
query reformulation frameworks, GenQR and GenPRF. GenQR directly reformulates
the user's input query, while GenPRF provides additional context for the query
by making use of pseudo-relevance feedback information. For each reformulation
method, we leverage different techniques, including fine-tuning and direct
prompting, to harness the knowledge of language models. The reformulated
queries produced by the generative models are demonstrated to markedly benefit
the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art retrieval pipeline on four TREC test
collections (varying from TREC 2004 Robust to the TREC 2019 Deep Learning).
Furthermore, our results indicate that our studied generative models can
outperform various statistical query expansion approaches while remaining
comparable to other existing complex neural query reformulation models, with
the added benefit of being simpler to implement.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a distributed cooperative positioning algorithm using the extended
Kalman filter (EKF) based spatio-temporal data fusion (STDF) for a wireless
network composed of sparsely distributed high-mobility nodes. Our algorithm
first makes a coarse estimation of the position and mobility state of the nodes
by using the prediction step of EKF. Then it utilizes the coarse estimate as
the prior of STDF that relies on factor graph (FG), thus facilitates inferring
a posteriori distributions of the agents' positions in a distributed manner. We
approximate the nonlinear terms of the messages passed on the associated FG
with high precision by exploiting the second-order Taylor polynomial and obtain
closed-form representations of each message in the data fusion step, where
temporal measurements by imperfect hardware are considered additionally. In the
third stage, refinement of position estimate is performed by invoking the
update step of EKF. Simulation results and analysis show that our EKF-STDF has
a lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art EKF-based
algorithms, while achieving an even superior positioning performance in harsh
environment.

<p class="mathjax">Because of the long planning periods and their long life cycle, railway
infrastructure has to be outlined long ahead. At the present, the
infrastructure is designed while only little about the intended operation is
known. Hence, the timetable and the operation are adjusted to the
infrastructure. Since space, time and money for extension measures of railway
infrastructure are limited, each modification has to be done carefully and long
lasting and should be appropriate for the future unknown demand.
<br />To take this into account, we present the robust network design problem for
railway infrastructure under capacity constraints and uncertain timetables.
Here, we plan the required expansion measures for an uncertain long-term
timetable. We show that this problem is NP-hard even when restricted to
bipartite graphs and very simple timetables and present easier solvable special
cases.
<br />This problem corresponds to the fixed-charge network design problem where the
expansion costs are minimized such that the timetable is conductible. We model
this problem by an integer linear program using time expanded networks.
<br />To incorporate the uncertainty of the future timetable, we use a
scenario-based approach. We define scenarios with individual departure and
arrival times and optional trains. The network is then optimized such that a
given percentage of the scenarios can be operated while minimizing the
expansion costs and potential penalty costs for not scheduled optional trains.

<p class="mathjax">Sentences that present a complex syntax act as a major stumbling block for
downstream Natural Language Processing applications whose predictive quality
deteriorates with sentence length and complexity. The task of Text
Simplification (TS) may remedy this situation. It aims to modify sentences in
order to make them easier to process, using a set of rewriting operations, such
as reordering, deletion, or splitting. State-of-the-art syntactic TS approaches
suffer from two major drawbacks: first, they follow a very conservative
approach in that they tend to retain the input rather than transforming it, and
second, they ignore the cohesive nature of texts, where context spread across
clauses or sentences is needed to infer the true meaning of a statement. To
address these problems, we present a discourse-aware TS approach that splits
and rephrases complex English sentences within the semantic context in which
they occur. Based on a linguistically grounded transformation stage that uses
clausal and phrasal disembedding mechanisms, complex sentences are transformed
into shorter utterances with a simple canonical structure that can be easily
analyzed by downstream applications. With sentence splitting, we thus address a
TS task that has hardly been explored so far. Moreover, we introduce the notion
of minimality in this context, as we aim to decompose source sentences into a
set of self-contained minimal semantic units. To avoid breaking down the input
into a disjointed sequence of statements that is difficult to interpret because
important contextual information is missing, we incorporate the semantic
context between the split propositions in the form of hierarchical structures
and semantic relationships. In that way, we generate a semantic hierarchy of
minimal propositions that leads to a novel representation of complex assertions
that puts a semantic layer on top of the simplified sentences.

<p class="mathjax">Handwritten signature verification is a significant biometric verification
method widely acknowledged by legal and financial institutions. However, the
development of automatic signature verification systems poses challenges due to
inter-writer similarity, intra-writer variations, and the limited number of
signature samples. To address these challenges, we propose a multiscale global
and regional feature learning network (MGRNet) with the co-tuplet loss, a new
metric learning loss, for offline handwritten signature verification. MGRNet
jointly learns global and regional information from various spatial scales and
integrates it to generate discriminative features. Consequently, it can capture
overall signature stroke information while detecting detailed local differences
between genuine and skilled-forged signatures. To enhance the discriminative
capability of our network further, we propose the co-tuplet loss, which
simultaneously considers multiple positive and negative examples to learn
distance metrics. By dealing with inter-writer similarity and intra-writer
variations and focusing on informative examples, the co-tuplet loss addresses
the limitations of typical metric learning losses. Additionally, we develop
HanSig, a large-scale Chinese signature dataset, to facilitate the development
of robust systems for this script. The dataset is available at
https://github.com/ashleyfhh/HanSig. Experimental results on four benchmark
datasets in different languages demonstrate the promising performance of our
method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection without priors of the anomalies is challenging. In the
field of unsupervised anomaly detection, traditional auto-encoder (AE) tends to
fail based on the assumption that by training only on normal images, the model
will not be able to reconstruct abnormal images correctly. On the contrary, we
propose a novel patch-wise auto-encoder (Patch AE) framework, which aims at
enhancing the reconstruction ability of AE to anomalies instead of weakening
it. Each patch of image is reconstructed by corresponding spatially distributed
feature vector of the learned feature representation, i.e., patch-wise
reconstruction, which ensures anomaly-sensitivity of AE. Our method is simple
and efficient. It advances the state-of-the-art performances on Mvtec AD
benchmark, which proves the effectiveness of our model. It shows great
potential in practical industrial application scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Formal verification of datapath circuits is challenging as they are subject
to intense optimization effort in the design phase. Industrial vendors and
design companies deploy equivalence checking against a golden or existing
reference design to satisfy correctness concerns. State-of-the-art datapath
equivalence checking tools deploy a suite of techniques, including rewriting.
We propose a rewriting framework deploying bitwidth dependent rewrites based on
the e-graph data structure, providing a powerful assistant to existing tools.
The e-graph can generate a path of rewrites between the reference and
implementation designs that can be checked by a trusted industry tool. We will
demonstrate how the intermediate proofs generated by the assistant enable
convergence in a state of the art tool, without which the industrial tool runs
for 24 hours without making progress. The intermediate proofs automatically
introduced by the assistant also reduce the total proof runtime by up to 6x.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the monotonicity of equilibrium costs and equilibrium
loads in nonatomic congestion games, in response to variations of the demands.
The main goal is to identify conditions under which a paradoxical non-monotone
behavior can be excluded. In contrast with routing games with a single
commodity, where the network topology is the sole determinant factor for
monotonicity, for general congestion games with multiple commodities the
structure of the strategy sets plays a crucial role. We frame our study in the
general setting of congestion games, with a special attention on
multi-commodity singleton congestion games, for which we establish the
monotonicity of equilibrium loads with respect to every demand. We then provide
conditions for comonotonicity of the equilibrium loads, i.e. we investigate
when they jointly increase or decrease after variations of the demands. We
finally extend our study from singleton congestion games to the larger class of
product-union congestion games, whose structure is reminiscent of the concept
of a series-parallel network.

<p class="mathjax">The recent progress in large language models (LLMs), especially the invention
of chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting, makes it possible to solve reasoning
problems. However, even the strongest LLMs are still struggling with more
complicated problems that require non-linear thinking and multi-step reasoning.
In this work, we explore whether LLMs have the ability to recognize their own
errors, without resorting to external resources. In particular, we investigate
whether they can be used to identify individual errors within a step-by-step
reasoning. To this end, we propose a zero-shot verification scheme to recognize
such errors. We then use this verification scheme to improve question-answering
performance, by using it to perform weighted voting on different generated
answers. We test the method on three math datasets-GSM8K, MathQA, and MATH-and
find that it successfully recognizes errors and, in turn, increases final
predictive performance.

technologies have become widely deployed. However, a detailed security study

<p class="mathjax">The quadratic computation complexity of self-attention has been a persistent
challenge when applying Transformer models to vision tasks. Linear attention,
on the other hand, offers a much more efficient alternative with its linear
complexity by approximating the Softmax operation through carefully designed
mapping functions. However, current linear attention approaches either suffer
from significant performance degradation or introduce additional computation
overhead from the mapping functions. In this paper, we propose a novel Focused
Linear Attention module to achieve both high efficiency and expressiveness.
Specifically, we first analyze the factors contributing to the performance
degradation of linear attention from two perspectives: the focus ability and
feature diversity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple yet
effective mapping function and an efficient rank restoration module to enhance
the expressiveness of self-attention while maintaining low computation
complexity. Extensive experiments show that our linear attention module is
applicable to a variety of advanced vision Transformers, and achieves
consistently improved performances on multiple benchmarks. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Computer networks have been traditionally configured by humans using
command-line interfaces. Some network abstractions have emerged in the last 10
years, but there is no easy way of comparing them to each other objectively.
Therefore, there is no consensus in the industry of what direction modern
network abstractions should take, and the adoption of these abstractions lags
as a consequence. In this paper I propose a comparison framework using metrics
derived from graph structures to evaluate the simplicity, efficiency, and
effectiveness of different network abstraction models. The result of this
comparison is that while some of the existing network abstractions are quite
efficient to store network policy (such as the Kubernetes or the Cisco
Application Centric Infrastructure models), others (notably public cloud) are
still very infrastructure-centric and suffer from excessive complexity.

<p class="mathjax">It is evident that the current state of Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the incorporation of external tools. The lack of straightforward
algebraic and logical reasoning is well documented and prompted researchers to
develop frameworks which allow LLMs to operate via external tools. The
ontological nature of tool utilization for a specific task can be well
formulated with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The central aim of the paper is
to highlight the importance of graph based approaches to LLM-tool interaction
in near future. We propose an exemplary framework to guide the orchestration of
exponentially increasing numbers of external tools with LLMs,where objectives
and functionalities of tools are graph encoded hierarchically. Assuming that
textual segments of a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can be imagined as a tool as
defined here, the graph based framework can pave new avenues in that particular
direction as well.

<p class="mathjax">Palmprint as biometrics has gained increasing attention recently due to its
discriminative ability and robustness. However, existing methods mainly improve
palmprint verification within one spectrum, which is challenging to verify
across different spectrums. Additionally, in distributed server-client-based
deployment, palmprint verification systems predominantly necessitate clients to
transmit private data for model training on the centralized server, thereby
engendering privacy apprehensions. To alleviate the above issues, in this
paper, we propose a physics-driven spectrum-consistent federated learning
method for palmprint verification, dubbed as PSFed-Palm. PSFed-Palm draws upon
the inherent physical properties of distinct wavelength spectrums, wherein
images acquired under similar wavelengths display heightened resemblances. Our
approach first partitions clients into short- and long-spectrum groups
according to the wavelength range of their local spectrum images. Subsequently,
we introduce anchor models for short- and long-spectrum, which constrain the
optimization directions of local models associated with long- and
short-spectrum images. Specifically, a spectrum-consistent loss that enforces
the model parameters and feature representation to align with their
corresponding anchor models is designed. Finally, we impose constraints on the
local models to ensure their consistency with the global model, effectively
preventing model drift. This measure guarantees spectrum consistency while
protecting data privacy, as there is no need to share local data. Extensive
experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed PSFed-Palm
approach. The proposed PSFed-Palm demonstrates compelling performance despite
only a limited number of training data. The codes will be released at
https://github.com/Zi-YuanYang/PSFed-Palm.

sample can manipulate a deep learning model to predict a different label.
However, existing techniques cannot certify samples that cannot meet their

MajorCert. MajorCert firstly finds all possible label sets manipulatable by the

enumerates their combinations element-wise, and finally checks whether the

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we demonstrate the application of a hybrid Vision Transformer
(ViT) model, pretrained on ImageNet, on an electroencephalogram (EEG)
regression task. Despite being originally trained for image classification
tasks, when fine-tuned on EEG data, this model shows a notable increase in
performance compared to other models, including an identical architecture ViT
trained without the ImageNet weights. This discovery challenges the traditional
understanding of model generalization, suggesting that Transformer models
pretrained on seemingly unrelated image data can provide valuable priors for
EEG regression tasks with an appropriate fine-tuning pipeline.
<br />The success of this approach suggests that the features extracted by ViT
models in the context of visual tasks can be readily transformed for the
purpose of EEG predictive modeling. We recommend utilizing this methodology not
only in neuroscience and related fields, but generally for any task where data
collection is limited by practical, financial, or ethical constraints. Our
results illuminate the potential of pretrained models on tasks that are clearly
distinct from their original purpose.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic grasping is a fundamental skill required for object manipulation in
robotics. Multi-fingered robotic hands, which mimic the structure of the human
hand, can potentially perform complex object manipulations. Nevertheless,
current techniques for multi-fingered robotic grasping frequently predict only
a single grasp for each inference time, limiting their versatility and
efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiable multi-fingered grasp
generation network (DMFC-GraspNet) with two main contributions to address this
challenge. Firstly, a novel neural grasp planner is proposed, which predicts a
new grasp representation to enable versatile and dense grasp predictions.
Secondly, a scene creation and label mapping method is developed for dense
labeling of multi-fingered robotic hands, which allows a dense association of
ground truth grasps. The proposed approach is evaluated through simulation
studies and compared to existing approaches. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting versatile and dense
grasps, and in advancing the field of robotic grasping.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive learning is a major studied topic in metric learning. However,
sampling effective contrastive pairs remains a challenge due to factors such as
limited batch size, imbalanced data distribution, and the risk of overfitting.
In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning function called Center
Contrastive Loss, which maintains a class-wise center bank and compares the
category centers with the query data points using a contrastive loss. The
center bank is updated in real-time to boost model convergence without the need
for well-designed sample mining. The category centers are well-optimized
classification proxies to re-balance the supervisory signal of each class.
Furthermore, the proposed loss combines the advantages of both contrastive and
classification methods by reducing intra-class variations and enhancing
inter-class differences to improve the discriminative power of embeddings. Our
experimental results, as shown in Figure 1, demonstrate that a standard network
(ResNet50) trained with our loss achieves state-of-the-art performance and
faster convergence.

<p class="mathjax">Talking-head video editing aims to efficiently insert, delete, and substitute
the word of a pre-recorded video through a text transcript editor. The key
challenge for this task is obtaining an editing model that generates new
talking-head video clips which simultaneously have accurate lip synchronization
and motion smoothness. Previous approaches, including 3DMM-based (3D Morphable
Model) methods and NeRF-based (Neural Radiance Field) methods, are sub-optimal
in that they either require minutes of source videos and days of training time
or lack the disentangled control of verbal (e.g., lip motion) and non-verbal
(e.g., head pose and expression) representations for video clip insertion. In
this work, we fully utilize the video context to design a novel framework for
talking-head video editing, which achieves efficiency, disentangled motion
control, and sequential smoothness. Specifically, we decompose this framework
to motion prediction and motion-conditioned rendering: (1) We first design an
animation prediction module that efficiently obtains smooth and lip-sync motion
sequences conditioned on the driven speech. This module adopts a
non-autoregressive network to obtain context prior and improve the prediction
efficiency, and it learns a speech-animation mapping prior with better
generalization to novel speech from a multi-identity video dataset. (2) We then
introduce a neural rendering module to synthesize the photo-realistic and
full-head video frames given the predicted motion sequence. This module adopts
a pre-trained head topology and uses only few frames for efficient fine-tuning
to obtain a person-specific rendering model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method efficiently achieves smoother editing results with higher image
quality and lip accuracy using less data than previous methods.

<p class="mathjax">With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the birth of various
new IoT devices, the capacity of massive IoT devices is facing challenges.
Fortunately, edge computing can optimize problems such as delay and
connectivity by offloading part of the computational tasks to edge nodes close
to the data source. Using this feature, IoT devices can save more resources
while still maintaining the quality of service. However, since computation
offloading decisions concern joint and complex resource management, we use
multiple Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents deployed on IoT devices to
guide their own decisions. Besides, Federated Learning (FL) is utilized to
train DRL agents in a distributed fashion, aiming to make the DRL-based
decision making practical and further decrease the transmission cost between
IoT devices and Edge Nodes. In this article, we first study the problem of
computation offloading optimization and prove the problem is an NP-hard
problem. Then, based on DRL and FL, we propose an offloading algorithm that is
different from the traditional method. Finally, we studied the effects of
various parameters on the performance of the algorithm and verified the
effectiveness of both the DRL and FL in the IoT system.

<p class="mathjax">Cities play an important role in achieving sustainable development goals
(SDGs) to promote economic growth and meet social needs. Especially satellite
imagery is a potential data source for studying sustainable urban development.
However, a comprehensive dataset in the United States (U.S.) covering multiple
cities, multiple years, multiple scales, and multiple indicators for SDG
monitoring is lacking. To support the research on SDGs in U.S. cities, we
develop a satellite imagery dataset using deep learning models for five SDGs
containing 25 sustainable development indicators. The proposed dataset covers
the 100 most populated U.S. cities and corresponding Census Block Groups from
2014 to 2023. Specifically, we collect satellite imagery and identify objects
with state-of-the-art object detection and semantic segmentation models to
observe cities' bird's-eye view. We further gather population, nighttime light,
survey, and built environment data to depict SDGs regarding poverty, health,
education, inequality, and living environment. We anticipate the dataset to
help urban policymakers and researchers to advance SDGs-related studies,
especially applying satellite imagery to monitor long-term and multi-scale SDGs
in cities.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the multi-step inertial randomized Kaczmarz (MIRK) method for
solving large-scale linear systems was proposed in [17]. In this paper, we
incorporate the greedy probability criterion into the MIRK method, along with
the introduction of a tighter threshold parameter for this criterion. We prove
that the proposed greedy MIRK (GMIRK) method enjoys an improved deterministic
linear convergence compared to both the MIRK method and the greedy randomized
Kaczmarz method. Furthermore, we exhibit that the multi-step inertial
extrapolation approach can be seen geometrically as an orthogonal projection
method, and establish its relationship with the sketch-and-project method [15]
and the oblique projection technique [22]. Numerical experiments are provided
to confirm our results.

<p class="mathjax">The zeroth-order optimization has been widely used in machine learning
applications. However, the theoretical study of the zeroth-order optimization
focus on the algorithms which approximate (first-order) gradients using
(zeroth-order) function value difference at a random direction. The theory of
algorithms which approximate the gradient and Hessian information by
zeroth-order queries is much less studied. In this paper, we focus on the
theory of zeroth-order optimization which utilizes both the first-order and
second-order information approximated by the zeroth-order queries. We first
propose a novel reparameterized objective function with parameters $(\mu,
\Sigma)$. This reparameterized objective function achieves its optimum at the
minimizer and the Hessian inverse of the original objective function
respectively, but with small perturbations. Accordingly, we propose a new
algorithm to minimize our proposed reparameterized objective, which we call
\texttt{MiNES} (mirror descent natural evolution strategy). We show that the
estimated covariance matrix of \texttt{MiNES} converges to the inverse of
Hessian matrix of the objective function with a convergence rate
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/k)$, where $k$ is the iteration number and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides the constant and $\log$ terms. We also
provide the explicit convergence rate of \texttt{MiNES} and how the covariance
matrix promotes the convergence rate.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an easy-to-control volume peeling method for multi-axis
machining based on the computation taken on vector fields. The current scalar
field based methods are not flexible and the vector-field based methods do not
guarantee the satisfaction of the constraints in the final results. We first
conduct an optimization formulation to compute an initial vector field that is
well aligned with those anchor vectors specified by users according to
different manufacturing requirements. The vector field is further optimized to
be an irrotational field so that it can be completely realized by a scalar
field's gradients. Iso-surfaces of the scalar field will be employed as the
layers of working surfaces for multi-axis volume peeling in the rough
machining. Algorithms are also developed to remove and process singularities of
the fields. Our method has been tested on a variety of models and verified by
physical experimental machining.

<p class="mathjax">Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are known to learn to
rely on spurious features, i.e., their prediction is based on undesired
auxiliary features which are strongly correlated with class labels but lack
causal reasoning. This behavior particularly degrades accuracy in groups of
samples of the correlated class that are missing the spurious feature or
samples of the opposite class but with the spurious feature present. The
recently proposed Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) method improves accuracy of
these worst groups. Based on the main argument that ERM mods can learn core
features sufficiently well, DFR only needs to retrain the last layer of the
classification model with a small group-balanced data set. In this work, we
examine the applicability of DFR to realistic data in the medical domain.
Furthermore, we investigate the reasoning behind the effectiveness of
last-layer retraining and show that even though DFR has the potential to
improve the accuracy of the worst group, it remains susceptible to spurious
correlations.

<p class="mathjax">Simulating marine sponge growth helps marine biologists analyze, measure, and
predict the effects that the marine environment has on marine sponges, and vice
versa. This paper describes a way to simulate and grow geometric models of the
marine sponge Crella incrustans while considering environmental factors
including fluid flow and nutrients. The simulation improves upon prior work by
changing the skeletal architecture of the sponge in the growth model to better
suit the structure of Crella incrustans. The change in skeletal architecture
and other simulation parameters are then evaluated qualitatively against photos
of a real-life Crella incrustans sponge. The results support the hypothesis
that changing the skeletal architecture from radiate accretive to Halichondrid
produces a sponge model which is closer in resemblance to Crella incrustans
than the prior work.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a many-sorted modal logic for reasoning about knowledge in
multi-agent systems. Our logic introduces a clear distinction between
participating agents and the environment. This allows to express local
properties of agents and global properties of worlds in a uniform way, as well
as to talk about the presence or absence of agents in a world. The logic
subsumes the standard epistemic logic and is a conservative extension of it.
The semantics is given in chromatic hypergraphs, a generalization of chromatic
simplicial complexes, which were recently used to model knowledge in
distributed systems. We show that the logic is sound and complete with respect
to the intended semantics. We also show a further connection of chromatic
hypergraphs with neighborhood frames.

<p class="mathjax">One advantage of neural ranking models is that they are meant to generalise
well in situations of synonymity i.e. where two words have similar or identical
meanings. In this paper, we investigate and quantify how well various ranking
models perform in a clear-cut case of synonymity: when words are simply
expressed in different surface forms due to regional differences in spelling
conventions (e.g., color vs colour). We first explore the prevalence of
American and British English spelling conventions in datasets used for the
pre-training, training and evaluation of neural retrieval methods, and find
that American spelling conventions are far more prevalent. Despite these biases
in the training data, we find that retrieval models often generalise well in
this case of synonymity. We explore the effect of document spelling
normalisation in retrieval and observe that all models are affected by
normalising the document's spelling. While they all experience a drop in
performance when normalised to a different spelling convention than that of the
query, we observe varied behaviour when the document is normalised to share the
query spelling convention: lexical models show improvements, dense retrievers
remain unaffected, and re-rankers exhibit contradictory behaviour.

<p class="mathjax">With the development of networking technology, the computing system has
evolved towards the multi-tier paradigm gradually. However, challenges, such as
multi-resource heterogeneity of devices, resource competition of services, and
networked system dynamics, make it difficult to guarantee service-level
agreement (SLA) for the applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier
edge-cloud computing framework, EdgeMatrix, to maximize the throughput of the
system while guaranteeing different SLA priorities. First, in order to reduce
the impact of physical resource heterogeneity, EdgeMatrix introduces the
Networked Multi-agent Actor-Critic (NMAC) algorithm to re-define physical
resources with the same quality of service as logically isolated resource units
and combinations, i.e., cells and channels. In addition, a multi-task mechanism
is designed in EdgeMatrix to solve the problem of Joint Service Orchestration
and Request Dispatch (JSORD) for matching the requests and services, which can
significantly reduce the optimization runtime. For integrating above two
algorithms, EdgeMatrix is designed with two time-scales, i.e., coordinating
services and resources at the larger time-scale, and dispatching requests at
the smaller time-scale. Realistic trace-based experiments proves that the
overall throughput of EdgeMatrix is 36.7% better than that of the closest
baseline, while the SLA priorities are guaranteed still.

network utilities, are known to contain erroneous or untrustworthy information.
This can compromise the effectiveness of physics-based engineering simulations

transition. The large-scale rollout of smart meters presents new opportunities
for data-driven system identification in distribution networks, enabling the
improvement of existing data sets. Despite the increasing academic attention to
system identification for distribution networks, researchers often make
troublesome assumptions on what data is available and/or trustworthy. In this

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the performance of network non-orthogonal multiple
access (N-NOMA) in a downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) system. In the
considered N-NOMA scheme, multiple base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve a
CoMP user, meanwhile, each BS serves additional NOMA users by occupying the
same resource block allocated to the CoMP user. The locations of the BSs and
users are modeled by stochastic geometric models and the interference from the
whole network is considered. Through rigorous derivations, the outage
probabilities achieved by the CoMP and NOMA users are obtained, respectively.
Numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of the analytical results
and also demonstrate the superior performance of N-NOMA compared to orthogonal
multiple access (OMA) based CoMP scheme.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we study the Biclique-Free Vertex Deletion problem: Given a
graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $i \le j$, find a set of at most $k$ vertices
that intersects every (not necessarily induced) biclique $K_{i, j}$ in $G$.
This is a natural generalization of the Bounded-Degree Deletion problem,
wherein one asks whether there is a set of at most $k$ vertices whose deletion
results in a graph of a given maximum degree $r$. The two problems coincide
when $i = 1$ and $j = r + 1$. We show that Biclique-Free Vertex Deletion is
fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k + d$ for the degeneracy $d$ by
developing a $2^{O(d k^2)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm. We also show that it
can be solved in $2^{O(f k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time for the feedback vertex
number $f$ when $i \ge 2$. In contrast, we find that it is W[1]-hard for the
treedepth for any integer $i \ge 1$. Finally, we show that Biclique-Free Vertex
Deletion has a polynomial kernel for every $i \ge 1$ when parameterized by the
feedback edge number. Previously, for this parameter, its fixed-parameter
tractability for $i = 1$ was known [Betzler et al., DAM '12] but the existence
of polynomial kernel was open.

<p class="mathjax">We study the classic Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem in the
Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. Given a set $X \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points, the goal is to produce a spanning tree for $X$
with weight within a small factor of optimal. Euclidean MST is one of the most
fundamental hierarchical geometric clustering algorithms, and with the
proliferation of enormous high-dimensional data sets, such as massive
transformer-based embeddings, there is now a critical demand for efficient
distributed algorithms to cluster such data sets.
<br />In low-dimensional space, where $d = O(1)$, Andoni, Nikolov, Onak, and
Yaroslavtsev [STOC '14] gave a constant round MPC algorithm that obtains a high
accuracy $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution. However, the situation is much
more challenging for high-dimensional spaces: the best-known algorithm to
obtain a constant approximation requires $O(\log n)$ rounds. Recently Chen,
Jayaram, Levi, and Waingarten [STOC '22] gave a $\tilde{O}(\log n)$
approximation algorithm in a constant number of rounds based on embeddings into
tree metrics. However, to date, no known algorithm achieves both a constant
number of rounds and approximation.
<br />In this paper, we make strong progress on this front by giving a constant
factor approximation in $\tilde{O}(\log \log n)$ rounds of the MPC model. In
contrast to tree-embedding-based approaches, which necessarily must pay
$\Omega(\log n)$-distortion, our algorithm is based on a new combination of
graph-based distributed MST algorithms and geometric space partitions.
Additionally, although the approximate MST we return can have a large depth, we
show that it can be modified to obtain a $\tilde{O}(\log \log n)$-round
constant factor approximation to the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
in the MPC model. Previously, only a $O(\log n)$ round was known for the
problem.

<p class="mathjax">Spectral clustering methods are known for their ability to represent clusters
of diverse shapes, densities etc. However, results of such algorithms, when
applied e.g. to text documents, are hard to explain to the user, especially due
to embedding in the spectral space which has no obvious relation to document
contents. Therefore there is an urgent need to elaborate methods for explaining
the outcome of the clustering. This paper presents a contribution towards this
goal. We present a proposal of explanation of results of combinatorial
Laplacian based graph spectral clustering. It is based on showing (approximate)
equivalence of combinatorial Laplacian embedding, $K$-embedding (proposed in
this paper) and term vector space embedding. Hence a bridge is constructed
between the textual contents and the clustering results. We provide theoretical
background for this approach. We performed experimental study showing that
$K$-embedding approximates well Laplacian embedding under favourable block
matrix conditions and show that approximation is good enough under other
conditions.

<p class="mathjax">In order to model criminal networks for law enforcement purposes, a limited
supply of data needs to be translated into validated agent-based models. What
is missing in current criminological modelling is a systematic and transparent
framework for modelers and domain experts that establishes a modelling
procedure for computational criminal modelling that includes translating
qualitative data into quantitative rules. For this, we propose FREIDA
(Framework for Expert-Informed Data-driven Agent-based models). Throughout the
paper, the criminal cocaine replacement model (CCRM) will be used as an example
case to demonstrate the FREIDA methodology. For the CCRM, a criminal cocaine
network in the Netherlands is being modelled where the kingpin node is being
removed, the goal being for the remaining agents to reorganize after the
disruption and return the network into a stable state. Qualitative data sources
such as case files, literature and interviews are translated into empirical
laws, and combined with the quantitative sources such as databases form the
three dimensions (environment, agents, behaviour) of a networked ABM. Four case
files are being modelled and scored both for training as well as for validation
scores to transition to the computational model and application phase
respectively. In the last phase, iterative sensitivity analysis, uncertainty
quantification and scenario testing eventually lead to a robust model that can
help law enforcement plan their intervention strategies. Results indicate the
need for flexible parameters as well as additional case file simulations to be
performed.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of parameter estimation, based on noisy chaotic
signals, from the viewpoint of twisted modulation for waveform communication.
In particular, we study communication systems where the parameter to be
estimated is conveyed as the initial condition of a chaotic dynamical system of
a certain class and we examine its estimation performance in terms of the
expectation of a given convex function of the estimation error at high SNR,
under the demand that the probability of anomaly is kept small. We derive a
lower bound on the weak-noise estimation error for this class of chaotic
modulators, and argue that it can be outperformed by using the itinerary signal
associated with the chaotic system instead of the main chaotic output signal.

<p class="mathjax">Context-aware methods achieved great success in supervised scene text
recognition via incorporating semantic priors from words. We argue that such
prior contextual information can be interpreted as the relations of textual
primitives due to the heterogeneous text and background, which can provide
effective self-supervised labels for representation learning. However, textual
relations are restricted to the finite size of dataset due to lexical
dependencies, which causes the problem of over-fitting and compromises
representation robustness. To this end, we propose to enrich the textual
relations via rearrangement, hierarchy and interaction, and design a unified
framework called RCLSTR: Relational Contrastive Learning for Scene Text
Recognition. Based on causality, we theoretically explain that three modules
suppress the bias caused by the contextual prior and thus guarantee
representation robustness. Experiments on representation quality show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised STR methods. Code is
available at https://github.com/ThunderVVV/RCLSTR.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces UVIO, a multi-sensor framework that leverages Ultra
Wide Band (UWB) technology and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) to provide robust
and low-drift localization. In order to include range measurements in state
estimation, the position of the UWB anchors must be known. This study proposes
a multi-step initialization procedure to map multiple unknown anchors by an
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), in a fully autonomous fashion. To address the
limitations of initializing UWB anchors via a random trajectory, this paper
uses the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) as a measure of optimality in
anchor position estimation, to compute a set of optimal waypoints and
synthesize a trajectory that minimizes the mapping uncertainty. After the
initialization is complete, the range measurements from multiple anchors,
including measurement biases, are tightly integrated into the VIO system. While
in range of the initialized anchors, the VIO drift in position and heading is
eliminated. The effectiveness of UVIO and our initialization procedure has been
validated through a series of simulations and real-world experiments.

<p class="mathjax">As the complexity of robot systems increases, it becomes more effective to
simulate them before deployment. To do this, a model of the robot's kinematics
or dynamics is required, and the most commonly used format is the Unified Robot
Description Format (URDF). This article presents, to our knowledge, the first
dataset of URDF files from various industrial and research organizations, with
metadata describing each robot, its type, manufacturer, and the source of the
model. The dataset contains 322 URDF files of which 195 are unique robot
models, meaning the excess URDFs are either of a robot that is multiply defined
across sources or URDF variants of the same robot. We analyze the files in the
dataset, where we, among other things, provide information on how they were
generated, which mesh file types are most commonly used, and compare models of
multiply defined robots. The intention of this article is to build a foundation
of knowledge on URDF and how it is used based on publicly available URDF files.
Publishing the dataset, analysis, and the scripts and tools used enables others
using, researching or developing URDFs to easily access this data and use it in
their own work.

<p class="mathjax">Markerless Human Pose Estimation (HPE) proved its potential to support
decision making and assessment in many fields of application. HPE is often
preferred to traditional marker-based Motion Capture systems due to the ease of
setup, portability, and affordable cost of the technology. However, the
exploitation of HPE in biomedical applications is still under investigation.
This review aims to provide an overview of current biomedical applications of
HPE. In this paper, we examine the main features of HPE approaches and discuss
whether or not those features are of interest to biomedical applications. We
also identify those areas where HPE is already in use and present peculiarities
and trends followed by researchers and practitioners. We include here 25
approaches to HPE and more than 40 studies of HPE applied to motor development
assessment, neuromuscolar rehabilitation, and gait &amp; posture analysis. We
conclude that markerless HPE offers great potential for extending diagnosis and
rehabilitation outside hospitals and clinics, toward the paradigm of remote
medical care.

<p class="mathjax">Logit based knowledge distillation gets less attention in recent years since
feature based methods perform better in most cases. Nevertheless, we find it
still has untapped potential when we re-investigate the temperature, which is a
crucial hyper-parameter to soften the logit outputs. For most of the previous
works, it was set as a fixed value for the entire distillation procedure.
However, as the logits from different samples are distributed quite variously,
it is not feasible to soften all of them to an equal degree by just a single
temperature, which may make the previous work transfer the knowledge of each
sample inadequately. In this paper, we restudy the hyper-parameter temperature
and figure out its incapability to distill the knowledge from each sample
sufficiently when it is a single value. To address this issue, we propose
Normalized Knowledge Distillation (NormKD), with the purpose of customizing the
temperature for each sample according to the characteristic of the sample's
logit distribution. Compared to the vanilla KD, NormKD barely has extra
computation or storage cost but performs significantly better on CIRAR-100 and
ImageNet for image classification. Furthermore, NormKD can be easily applied to
the other logit based methods and achieve better performance which can be
closer to or even better than the feature based method.

<p class="mathjax">This white paper presents our work on SurveyLM, a platform for analyzing
augmented language models' (ALMs) emergent alignment behaviors through their
dynamically evolving attitude and value perspectives in complex social
contexts. Social Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, like ALMs, often
function within nuanced social scenarios where there is no singular correct
response, or where an answer is heavily dependent on contextual factors, thus
necessitating an in-depth understanding of their alignment dynamics. To address
this, we apply survey and experimental methodologies, traditionally used in
studying social behaviors, to evaluate ALMs systematically, thus providing
unprecedented insights into their alignment and emergent behaviors. Moreover,
the SurveyLM platform leverages the ALMs' own feedback to enhance survey and
experiment designs, exploiting an underutilized aspect of ALMs, which
accelerates the development and testing of high-quality survey frameworks while
conserving resources. Through SurveyLM, we aim to shed light on factors
influencing ALMs' emergent behaviors, facilitate their alignment with human
intentions and expectations, and thereby contributed to the responsible
development and deployment of advanced social AI systems. This white paper
underscores the platform's potential to deliver robust results, highlighting
its significance to alignment research and its implications for future social
AI systems.

<p class="mathjax">Adaptive optimization has achieved notable success for distributed learning
while extending adaptive optimizer to federated Learning (FL) suffers from
severe inefficiency, including (i) rugged convergence due to inaccurate
gradient estimation in global adaptive optimizer; (ii) client drifts
exacerbated by local over-fitting with the local adaptive optimizer. In this
work, we propose a novel momentum-based algorithm via utilizing the global
gradient descent and locally adaptive amended optimizer to tackle these
difficulties. Specifically, we incorporate a locally amended technique to the
adaptive optimizer, named Federated Local ADaptive Amended optimizer
(\textit{FedLADA}), which estimates the global average offset in the previous
communication round and corrects the local offset through a momentum-like term
to further improve the empirical training speed and mitigate the heterogeneous
over-fitting. Theoretically, we establish the convergence rate of
\textit{FedLADA} with a linear speedup property on the non-convex case under
the partial participation settings. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments
on the real-world dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
\textit{FedLADA}, which could greatly reduce the communication rounds and
achieves higher accuracy than several baselines.

<p class="mathjax">This article aims to classify diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease into five
different classes using an ensemble approach based on two popular pre-trained
convolutional neural networks: VGG16 and Inception V3. The proposed model aims
to leverage the strengths of the two individual nets to enhance the
classification performance for diabetic retinopathy. The ensemble model
architecture involves freezing a portion of the layers in each pre-trained
model to utilize their learned representations effectively. Global average
pooling layers are added to transform the output feature maps into fixed-length
vectors. These vectors are then concatenated to form a consolidated
representation of the input image. The ensemble model is trained using a
dataset of diabetic retinopathy images (APTOS), divided into training and
validation sets. During the training process, the model learns to classify the
retinal images into the corresponding diabetic retinopathy classes.
Experimental results on the test set demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
ensemble model for DR classification achieving an accuracy of 96.4%.

<p class="mathjax">Internet Memes remain a challenging form of user-generated content for
automated sentiment classification. The availability of labelled memes is a
barrier to developing sentiment classifiers of multimodal memes. To address the
shortage of labelled memes, we propose to supplement the training of a
multimodal meme classifier with unimodal (image-only and text-only) data. In
this work, we present a novel variant of supervised intermediate training that
uses relatively abundant sentiment-labelled unimodal data. Our results show a
statistically significant performance improvement from the incorporation of
unimodal text data. Furthermore, we show that the training set of labelled
memes can be reduced by 40% without reducing the performance of the downstream
model.

<p class="mathjax">The physical design process of large-scale designs is a time-consuming task,
often requiring hours to days to complete, with routing being the most critical
and complex step. As the the complexity of Integrated Circuits (ICs) increases,
there is an increased demand for accurate routing quality prediction. Accurate
congestion prediction aids in identifying design flaws early on, thereby
accelerating circuit design and conserving resources. Despite the advancements
in current congestion prediction methodologies, an essential aspect that has
been largely overlooked is the spatial label-correlation between different
grids in congestion prediction. The spatial label-correlation is a fundamental
characteristic of circuit design, where the congestion status of a grid is not
isolated but inherently influenced by the conditions of its neighboring grids.
In order to fully exploit the inherent spatial label-correlation between
neighboring grids, we propose a novel approach, {\ours}, i.e., VAriational
Label-Correlation Enhancement for Congestion Prediction, which considers the
local label-correlation in the congestion map, associating the estimated
congestion value of each grid with a local label-correlation weight influenced
by its surrounding grids. {\ours} leverages variational inference techniques to
estimate this weight, thereby enhancing the regression model's performance by
incorporating spatial dependencies. Experiment results validate the superior
effectiveness of {\ours} on the public available \texttt{ISPD2011} and
\texttt{DAC2012} benchmarks using the superblue circuit line.

<p class="mathjax">Counting objects in crowded scenes remains a challenge to computer vision.
The current deep learning based approach often formulate it as a Gaussian
density regression problem. Such a brute-force regression, though effective,
may not consider the annotation noise properly which arises from the human
annotation process and may lead to different distributions. We conjecture that
it would be beneficial to consider the annotation noise in the dense object
counting task. To obtain strong robustness against annotation noise,
generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) function with a tunable bandwidth and
shape parameter is exploited to form the learning target point annotation
probability map, PAPM. Specifically, we first present a hand-designed PAPM
method (HD-PAPM), in which we design a function based on GGD to tolerate the
annotation noise. For end-to-end training, the hand-designed PAPM may not be
optimal for the particular network and dataset. An adaptively learned PAPM
method (AL-PAPM) is proposed. To improve the robustness to annotation noise, we
design an effective transport cost function based on GGD. With such transport
cost constraints, a better PAPM presentation could be adaptively learned with
an optimal transport framework from point annotation in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments show the superiority of our proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the adaptive bitrate (ABR) video semantic
communication over wireless networks. In the considered model, video sensing
devices must transmit video semantic information to an edge server, to
facilitate ubiquitous video sensing services such as road environment
monitoring at the edge server in autonomous driving scenario. However, due to
the varying wireless network conditions, it is challenging to guarantee both
low transmission delay and high semantic accuracy at the same time if devices
continuously transmit a fixed bitrate video semantic information. To address
this challenge, we develop an adaptive bitrate video semantic communication
(ABRVSC) system, in which devices adaptively adjust the bitrate of video
semantic information according to network conditions. Specifically, we first
define the quality of experience (QoE) for video semantic communication.
Subsequently, a swin transformer-based semantic codec is proposed to extract
semantic information with considering the influence of QoE. Then, we propose an
Actor-Critic based ABR algorithm for the semantic codec to enhance the
robustness of the proposed ABRVSC scheme against network variations. Simulation
results demonstrate that at low bitrates, the mean intersection over union
(MIoU) of the proposed ABRVSC scheme is nearly twice that of the traditional
scheme. Moreover, the proposed ABRVSC scheme, which increases the QoE in video
semantic communication by 36.57%, exhibits more robustness against network
variations compared to both the fixed bitrate schemes and traditional ABR
schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate Vehicle Trajectory Prediction is critical for automated vehicles and
advanced driver assistance systems. Vehicle trajectory prediction consists of
two essential tasks, i.e., longitudinal position prediction and lateral
position prediction. There is a significant correlation between driving
intentions and vehicle motion. In existing work, the three tasks are often
conducted separately without considering the relationships between the
longitudinal position, lateral position, and driving intention. In this paper,
we propose a novel Temporal Multi-Gate Mixture-of-Experts (TMMOE) model for
simultaneously predicting the vehicle trajectory and driving intention. The
proposed model consists of three layers: a shared layer, an expert layer, and a
fully connected layer. In the model, the shared layer utilizes Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCN) to extract temporal features. Then the expert
layer is built to identify different information according to the three tasks.
Moreover, the fully connected layer is used to integrate and export prediction
results. To achieve better performance, uncertainty algorithm is used to
construct the multi-task loss function. Finally, the publicly available CitySim
dataset validates the TMMOE model, demonstrating superior performance compared
to the LSTM model, achieving the highest classification and regression results.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising results on
exploiting node representations for many downstream tasks through supervised
end-to-end training. To deal with the widespread label scarcity issue in
real-world applications, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is leveraged to train
GNNs with limited or even no labels by maximizing the mutual information
between nodes in its augmented views generated from the original graph.
However, the distribution of graphs remains unconsidered in view generation,
resulting in the ignorance of unseen edges in most existing literature, which
is empirically shown to be able to improve GCL's performance in our
experiments. To this end, we propose to incorporate graph generative
adversarial networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of views for GCL, in
order to i) automatically capture the characteristic of graphs for
augmentations, and ii) jointly train the graph GAN model and the GCL model.
Specifically, we present GACN, a novel Generative Adversarial Contrastive
learning Network for graph representation learning. GACN develops a view
generator and a view discriminator to generate augmented views automatically in
an adversarial style. Then, GACN leverages these views to train a GNN encoder
with two carefully designed self-supervised learning losses, including the
graph contrastive loss and the Bayesian personalized ranking Loss. Furthermore,
we design an optimization framework to train all GACN modules jointly.
Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show that GACN is able to
generate high-quality augmented views for GCL and is superior to twelve
state-of-the-art baseline methods. Noticeably, our proposed GACN surprisingly
discovers that the generated views in data augmentation finally conform to the
well-known preferential attachment rule in online networks.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate online transient stability prediction is critical for ensuring power
system stability when facing disturbances. While traditional transient stablity
analysis replies on the time domain simulations can not be quickly adapted to
the power grid toplogy change. In order to vectorize high-dimensional power
grid topological structure information into low-dimensional node-based graph
embedding streaming data, graph embedding dynamic feature (GEDF) has been
proposed. The transient stability GEDF-based supervised contrastive learning
(GEDF-SCL) model uses supervised contrastive learning to predict transient
stability with GEDFs, considering power grid topology information. To evaluate
the performance of the proposed GEDF-SCL model, power grids of varying
topologies were generated based on the IEEE 39-bus system model. Transient
operational data was obtained by simulating N-1 and N-$\bm{m}$-1 contingencies
on these generated power system topologies. Test result demonstrated that the
GEDF-SCL model can achieve high accuracy in transient stability prediction and
adapt well to changing power grid topologies.

<p class="mathjax">We propose PressureTransferNet, a novel method for Human Activity Recognition
(HAR) using ground pressure information. Our approach generates body-specific
dynamic ground pressure profiles for specific activities by leveraging existing
pressure data from different individuals. PressureTransferNet is an
encoder-decoder model taking a source pressure map and a target human attribute
vector as inputs, producing a new pressure map reflecting the target attribute.
To train the model, we use a sensor simulation to create a diverse dataset with
various human attributes and pressure profiles. Evaluation on a real-world
dataset shows its effectiveness in accurately transferring human attributes to
ground pressure profiles across different scenarios. We visually confirm the
fidelity of the synthesized pressure shapes using a physics-based deep learning
model and achieve a binary R-square value of 0.79 on areas with ground contact.
Validation through classification with F1 score (0.911$\pm$0.015) on physical
pressure mat data demonstrates the correctness of the synthesized pressure
maps, making our method valuable for data augmentation, denoising, sensor
simulation, and anomaly detection. Applications span sports science,
rehabilitation, and bio-mechanics, contributing to the development of HAR
systems.

high-quality adherence predictions. Based on the results, the dynamic features
positively influence a model's classification performance. Due to the
imbalanced nature of the dataset, we employed oversampling methods such as
SMOTE and ADASYN to improve the classification performance. The oversampling
approaches led to a remarkable improvement of 10\%. Our methods won first place
in the IFMBE Scientific Challenge 2022.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that allows a central server
to train machine learning models using remote users' data. Despite its growing
popularity, FL faces challenges in preserving the privacy of local datasets,
its sensitivity to poisoning attacks by malicious users, and its communication
overhead. The latter is additionally considerably dominant in large-scale
networks. These limitations are often individually mitigated by local
differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, robust aggregation, compression, and
user selection techniques, which typically come at the cost of accuracy. In
this work, we present compressed private aggregation (CPA), that allows massive
deployments to simultaneously communicate at extremely low bit rates while
achieving privacy, anonymity, and resilience to malicious users. CPA randomizes
a codebook for compressing the data into a few bits using nested lattice
quantizers, while ensuring anonymity and robustness, with a subsequent
perturbation to hold LDP. The proposed CPA is proven to result in FL
convergence in the same asymptotic rate as FL without privacy, compression, and
robustness considerations, while satisfying both anonymity and LDP
requirements. These analytical properties are empirically confirmed in a
numerical study, where we demonstrate the performance gains of CPA compared
with separate mechanisms for compression and privacy for training different
image classification models, as well as its robustness in mitigating the
harmful effects of malicious users.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based fine-grained network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)
enable different attacks to be responded to in a fast and targeted manner with
the help of large-scale labels. However, the cost of labeling causes
insufficient labeled samples. Also, the real fine-grained traffic shows a
long-tailed distribution with great class imbalance. These two problems often
appear simultaneously, posing serious challenges to fine-grained NIDS. In this
work, we propose a novel semi-supervised fine-grained intrusion detection
framework, SF-IDS, to achieve attack classification in the label-limited and
highly class imbalanced case. We design a self-training backbone model called
RI-1DCNN to boost the feature extraction by reconstructing the input samples
into a multichannel image format. The uncertainty of the generated
pseudo-labels is evaluated and used as a reference for pseudo-label filtering
in combination with the prediction probability. To mitigate the effects of
fine-grained class imbalance, we propose a hybrid loss function combining
supervised contrastive loss and multi-weighted classification loss to obtain
more compact intra-class features and clearer inter-class intervals.
Experiments show that the proposed SF-IDS achieves 3.01% and 2.71% Marco-F1
improvement on two classical datasets with 1% labeled, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been proposed as a promising
paradigm in the future wireless networks, where the spectral and hardware
resources are shared to provide a considerable performance gain. It is
essential to understand how sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) influences each
other to guide the practical algorithm and system design in ISAC. In this
paper, we investigate the performance tradeoff between S\&amp;C in a single-input
single-output (SISO) ISAC system with finite blocklength. In particular, we
present the system model and the ISAC scheme, after which the rate-error
tradeoff is introduced as the performance metric. Then we derive the
achievability and converse bounds for the rate-error tradeoff, determining the
boundary of the joint S\&amp;C performance. Furthermore, we develop the asymptotic
analysis at large blocklength regime, where the performance tradeoff between
S\&amp;C is proved to vanish as the blocklength tends to infinity. Finally, our
theoretical analysis is consolidated by simulation results.

<p class="mathjax">Many neurodegenerative diseases are connected to the spreading of misfolded
prionic proteins. In this paper, we analyse the process of misfolding and
spreading of both $\alpha$-synuclein and Amyloid-$\beta$, related to
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, respectively. We introduce and analyze a
positivity-preserving numerical method for the discretization of the
Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, modelling accumulation and spreading of prionic
proteins. The proposed approximation method is based on the discontinuous
Galerkin method on polygonal and polyhedral grids for space discretization and
on $\vartheta-$method time integration scheme. We prove the existence of the
discrete solution and a convergence result where the Implicit Euler scheme is
employed for time integration. We show that the proposed approach is
structure-preserving, in the sense that it guaranteed that the discrete
solution is non-negative, a feature that is of paramount importance in
practical application. The numerical verification of our numerical model is
performed both using a manufactured solution and considering wavefront
propagation in two-dimensional polygonal grids. Next, we present a simulation
of $\alpha$-synuclein spreading in a two-dimensional brain slice in the
sagittal plane. The polygonal mesh for this simulation is agglomerated
maintaining the distinction of white and grey matter, taking advantage of the
flexibility of PolyDG methods in the mesh construction. Finally, we simulate
the spreading of Amyloid-$\beta$ in a patient-specific setting by using a
three-dimensional geometry reconstructed from magnetic resonance images and an
initial condition reconstructed from positron emission tomography. Our
numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method is able to capture the
evolution of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

<p class="mathjax">Instance-wise feature selection and ranking methods can achieve a good
selection of task-friendly features for each sample in the context of neural
networks. However, existing approaches that assume feature subsets to be
independent are imperfect when considering the dependency between features. To
address this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Gaussian copula, a
powerful mathematical technique for capturing correlations between variables,
into the current feature selection framework with no additional changes needed.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, in terms of
performance comparison and interpretability, demonstrate that our method is
capable of capturing meaningful correlations.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has become very popular since it enables clients to
train a joint model collaboratively without sharing their private data.
However, FL has been shown to be susceptible to backdoor and inference attacks.
While in the former, the adversary injects manipulated updates into the
aggregation process; the latter leverages clients' local models to deduce their
private data. Contemporary solutions to address the security concerns of FL are
either impractical for real-world deployment due to high-performance overheads
or are tailored towards addressing specific threats, for instance,
privacy-preserving aggregation or backdoor defenses. Given these limitations,
our research delves into the advantages of harnessing the FPGA-based computing
paradigm to overcome performance bottlenecks of software-only solutions while
mitigating backdoor and inference attacks. We utilize FPGA-based enclaves to
address inference attacks during the aggregation process of FL. We adopt an
advanced backdoor-aware aggregation algorithm on the FPGA to counter backdoor
attacks. We implemented and evaluated our method on Xilinx VMK-180, yielding a
significant speed-up of around 300 times on the IoT-Traffic dataset and more
than 506 times on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The notion of shortcut partition, introduced recently by Chang, Conroy, Le,
Milenkovi\'c, Solomon, and Than [CCLMST23], is a new type of graph partition
into low-diameter clusters. Roughly speaking, the shortcut partition guarantees
that for every two vertices $u$ and $v$ in the graph, there exists a path
between $u$ and $v$ that intersects only a few clusters. They proved that any
planar graph admits a shortcut partition and gave several applications,
including a construction of tree cover for arbitrary planar graphs with stretch
$1+\varepsilon$ and $O(1)$ many trees for any fixed $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$.
However, the construction heavily exploits planarity in multiple steps, and is
thus inherently limited to planar graphs.
<br />In this work, we breach the "planarity barrier" to construct a shortcut
partition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs for any $r$. To this end, we take a
completely different approach -- our key contribution is a novel deterministic
variant of the cop decomposition in minor-free graphs [And86, AGG14]. Our
shortcut partition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs yields several direct
applications. Most notably, we construct the first optimal distance oracle for
$K_r$-minor-free graphs, with $1+\varepsilon$ stretch, linear space, and
constant query time for any fixed $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. The previous best
distance oracle [AG06] uses $O(n\log n)$ space and $O(\log n)$ query time, and
its construction relies on Robertson-Seymour structural theorem and other
sophisticated tools. We also obtain the first tree cover of $O(1)$ size for
minor-free graphs with stretch $1+\varepsilon$, while the previous best
$(1+\varepsilon)$-tree cover has size $O(\log^2 n)$ [BFN19].

<p class="mathjax">Deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising neural networks for their
model capacity from deep neural network architecture and energy efficiency from
SNNs' operations. To train deep SNNs, recently, spatio-temporal backpropagation
(STBP) with surrogate gradient was proposed. Although deep SNNs have been
successfully trained with STBP, they cannot fully utilize spike information. In
this work, we proposed gradient scaling with local spike information, which is
the relation between pre- and post-synaptic spikes. Considering the causality
between spikes, we could enhance the training performance of deep SNNs.
According to our experiments, we could achieve higher accuracy with lower
spikes by adopting the gradient scaling on image classification tasks, such as
CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.

<p class="mathjax">Inverse obstacle scattering is the recovery of an obstacle boundary from the
scattering data produced by incident waves. This shape recovery can be done by
iteratively solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the obstacle
boundary. While it is well known that this problem is typically non-convex and
ill-posed, previous investigations have shown that in many settings these
issues can be alleviated by using a continuation-in-frequency method and
introducing a regularization that limits the frequency content of the obstacle
boundary. It has been recently observed that these techniques can fail for
obstacles with pronounced cavities, even in the case of penetrable obstacles
where similar optimization and regularization methods work for the equivalent
problem of recovering a piecewise constant wave speed.
<br />The present work investigates the recovery of obstacle boundaries for
impenetrable, sound-soft media with pronounced cavities, given multi-frequency
scattering data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the problem is sensitive
to the choice of iterative solver used at each frequency and the initial guess
at the lowest frequency. We propose a modified continuation-in-frequency method
which follows a random walk in frequency, as opposed to the standard
monotonically increasing path. This method shows some increased robustness in
recovering cavities, but can also fail for more extreme examples. An
interesting phenomenon is observed that while the obstacle reconstructions
obtained over several random trials can vary significantly near the cavity, the
results are consistent for non-cavity parts of the boundary.

<p class="mathjax">The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known problem in combinatorial
optimization with applications in various domains. However, existing TSP
solvers face challenges in producing high-quality solutions with low latency.
To address this issue, we propose NAR4TSP, which produces TSP solutions in a
Non-Autoregressive (NAR) manner using a specially designed Graph Neural Network
(GNN), achieving faster inference speed. Moreover, NAR4TSP is trained using an
enhanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy, eliminating the dependency on
costly labels used to train conventional supervised learning-based NAR models.
To the best of our knowledge, NAR4TSP is the first TSP solver that successfully
combines RL and NAR decoding. The experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world TSP instances demonstrate that NAR4TSP outperforms four
state-of-the-art models in terms of solution quality, inference latency, and
generalization ability. Lastly, we present visualizations of NAR4TSP's decoding
process and its overall path planning to showcase the feasibility of
implementing NAR4TSP in an end-to-end manner and its effectiveness,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) enabled edge
caching system is proposed for reducing backhaul traffic and ensuring the
quality of service. A novel Caching-at-STARS structure, where a dedicated smart
controller and cache memory are installed at the STARS, is proposed to satisfy
user demands with fewer hops and desired channel conditions. Then, a joint
caching replacement and information-centric hybrid beamforming optimization
problem is formulated for minimizing the network power consumption. As
long-term decision processes, the optimization problems based on independent
and coupled phase-shift models of Caching-at-STARS contain both continuous and
discrete decision variables, and are suitable for solving with deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. For the independent phase-shift
Caching-at-STARS model, we develop a frequency-aware based twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (FA-TD3) algorithm that leverages user historical
request information to serialize high-dimensional caching replacement decision
variables. For the coupled phase-shift Caching-at-STARS model, we conceive a
cooperative TD3 \&amp; deep-Q network (TD3-DQN) algorithm comprised of FA-TD3 and
DQN agents to decide on continuous and discrete variables respectively by
observing the network external and internal environment. The numerical results
demonstrate that: 1) The Caching-at-STARS-enabled edge caching system has
advantages over traditional edge caching, especially in scenarios where Zipf
skewness factors or cache capacity is large; 2) Caching-at-STARS outperforms
the RIS-assisted edge caching systems; 3) The proposed FA-TD3 and cooperative
TD3-DQN algorithms are superior in reducing network power consumption than
conventional TD3.

<p class="mathjax">Utilizing wind hovering techniques of soaring birds can save energy
expenditure and improve the flight endurance of micro air vehicles (MAVs).
Here, we present a novel method for fully autonomous orographic soaring without
a priori knowledge of the wind field. Specifically, we devise an Incremental
Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) controller with control allocation, adapting
it for autonomous soaring. This allows for both soaring and the use of the
throttle if necessary, without changing any gain or parameter during the
flight. Furthermore, we propose a simulated-annealing-based optimization method
to search for soaring positions. This enables for the first time an MAV to
autonomously find a feasible soaring position while minimizing throttle usage
and other control efforts. Autonomous orographic soaring was performed in the
wind tunnel. The wind speed and incline of a ramp were changed during the
soaring flight. The MAV was able to perform autonomous orographic soaring for
flight times of up to 30 minutes. The mean throttle usage was only 0.25% for
the entire soaring flight, whereas normal powered flight requires 38%. Also, it
was shown that the MAV can find a new soaring spot when the wind field changes
during the flight.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning is a promising paradigm in deep learning that
enables learning from unlabeled data by constructing pretext tasks that require
learning useful representations. In natural language processing, the dominant
pretext task has been masked language modeling (MLM), while in computer vision
there exists an equivalent called Masked Image Modeling (MIM). However, MIM is
challenging because it requires predicting semantic content in accurate
locations. E.g, given an incomplete picture of a dog, we can guess that there
is a tail, but we cannot determine its exact location. In this work, we propose
FlexPredict, a stochastic model that addresses this challenge by incorporating
location uncertainty into the model. Specifically, we condition the model on
stochastic masked token positions to guide the model toward learning features
that are more robust to location uncertainties. Our approach improves
downstream performance on a range of tasks, e.g, compared to MIM baselines,
FlexPredict boosts ImageNet linear probing by 1.6% with ViT-B and by 2.5% for
semi-supervised video segmentation using ViT-L.

<p class="mathjax">The recent increase in data availability and reliability has led to a surge
in the development of learning-based model predictive control (MPC) frameworks
for robot systems. Despite attaining substantial performance improvements over
their non-learning counterparts, many of these frameworks rely on an offline
learning procedure to synthesize a dynamics model. This implies that
uncertainties encountered by the robot during deployment are not accounted for
in the learning process. On the other hand, learning-based MPC methods that
learn dynamics models online are computationally expensive and often require a
significant amount of data. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose a novel
learning-enhanced MPC framework that incorporates components from
$\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control into learning-based MPC. This integration
enables the accurate compensation of both matched and unmatched uncertainties
in a sample-efficient way, enhancing the control performance during deployment.
In our proposed framework, we present two variants and apply them to the
control of a quadrotor system. Through simulations and physical experiments, we
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only allows the synthesis of an
accurate dynamics model on-the-fly, but also significantly improves the
closed-loop control performance under a wide range of spatio-temporal
uncertainties.

<p class="mathjax">Convolution-based and Transformer-based vision backbone networks process
images into the grid or sequence structures, respectively, which are inflexible
for capturing irregular objects. Though Vision GNN (ViG) adopts graph-level
features for complex images, it has some issues, such as inaccurate neighbor
node selection, expensive node information aggregation calculation, and
over-smoothing in the deep layers. To address the above problems, we propose a
Progressive Vision Graph (PVG) architecture for vision recognition task.
Compared with previous works, PVG contains three main components: 1)
Progressively Separated Graph Construction (PSGC) to introduce second-order
similarity by gradually increasing the channel of the global graph branch and
decreasing the channel of local branch as the layer deepens; 2) Neighbor nodes
information aggregation and update module by using Max pooling and mathematical
Expectation (MaxE) to aggregate rich neighbor information; 3) Graph error
Linear Unit (GraphLU) to enhance low-value information in a relaxed form to
reduce the compression of image detail information for alleviating the
over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of PVG over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., our PVG-S obtains 83.0%
Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K that surpasses GNN-based ViG-S by +0.9 with the
parameters reduced by 18.5%, while the largest PVG-B obtains 84.2% that has
+0.5 improvement than ViG-B. Furthermore, our PVG-S obtains +1.3 box AP and
+0.4 mask AP gains than ViG-S on COCO dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient and accurate 3D object shape reconstruction contributes
significantly to the success of a robot's physical interaction with its
environment. Acquiring accurate shape information about unknown objects is
challenging, especially in unstructured environments, e.g. the vision sensors
may only be able to provide a partial view. To address this issue, tactile
sensors could be employed to extract local surface information for more robust
unknown object shape estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
efficient unknown 3D object shape exploration and reconstruction using a
multi-fingered hand equipped with tactile sensors and a depth camera only
providing a partial view. We present a multi-finger sliding touch strategy for
efficient shape exploration using a Bayesian Optimization approach and a
single-leader-multi-follower strategy for multi-finger smooth local surface
perception. We evaluate our proposed method by estimating the 3D shape of
objects from the YCB and OCRTOC datasets based on simulation and real robot
experiments. The proposed approach yields successful reconstruction results
relying on only a few continuous sliding touches. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method is able to model unknown objects in an efficient
and accurate way.

<p class="mathjax">In applications such as search and rescue or disaster relief, heterogeneous
multi-robot systems (MRS) can provide significant advantages for complex
objectives that require a suite of capabilities. However, within these
application spaces, communication is often unreliable, causing inefficiencies
or outright failures to arise in most MRS algorithms. Many researchers tackle
this problem by requiring all robots to either maintain communication using
proximity constraints or assuming that all robots will execute a predetermined
plan over long periods of disconnection. The latter method allows for higher
levels of efficiency in a MRS, but failures and environmental uncertainties can
have cascading effects across the system, especially when a mission objective
is complex or time-sensitive. To solve this, we propose an epistemic planning
framework that allows robots to reason about the system state, leverage
heterogeneous system makeups, and optimize information dissemination to
disconnected neighbors. Dynamic epistemic logic formalizes the propagation of
belief states, and epistemic task allocation and gossip is accomplished via a
mixed integer program using the belief states for utility predictions and
planning. The proposed framework is validated using simulations and experiments
with heterogeneous vehicles.

<p class="mathjax">Person clustering with multi-modal clues, including faces, bodies, and
voices, is critical for various tasks, such as movie parsing and identity-based
movie editing. Related methods such as multi-view clustering mainly project
multi-modal features into a joint feature space. However, multi-modal clue
features are usually rather weakly correlated due to the semantic gap from the
modality-specific uniqueness. As a result, these methods are not suitable for
person clustering. In this paper, we propose a Relation-Aware Distribution
representation Network (RAD-Net) to generate a distribution representation for
multi-modal clues. The distribution representation of a clue is a vector
consisting of the relation between this clue and all other clues from all
modalities, thus being modality agnostic and good for person clustering.
Accordingly, we introduce a graph-based method to construct distribution
representation and employ a cyclic update policy to refine distribution
representation progressively. Our method achieves substantial improvements of
+6% and +8.2% in F-score on the Video Person-Clustering Dataset (VPCD) and
VoxCeleb2 multi-view clustering dataset, respectively. Codes will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Consensus algorithms facilitate agreement on and resolution of blockchain
functions, such as smart contracts and transactions. Ethereum uses a
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which depends on financial incentives
to ensure that validators perform certain duties and do not act maliciously.
Should a validator attempt to defraud the system, legitimate validators will
identify this and then staked cryptocurrency is `burned' through a process of
slashing.
<br />In this paper, we show that an attacker who has compromised a set of
validators could threaten to perform malicious actions that would result in
slashing and thus, hold those validators to ransom. We use game theory to study
how an attacker can coerce payment from a victim, for example by deploying a
smart contract to provide a root of trust shared between attacker and victim
during the extortion process. Our game theoretic model finds that it is in the
interests of the validators to fully pay the ransom due to a lack of systemic
protections for validators. Financial risk is solely placed on the victim
during such an attack, with no mitigations available to them aside from
capitulation (payment of ransom) in many scenarios. Such attacks could be
disruptive to Ethereum and, likely, to many other PoS networks, if public trust
in the validator system is eroded. We also discuss and evaluate potential
mitigation measures arising from our analysis of the game theoretic model.

<p class="mathjax">Low-light hazy scenes commonly appear at dusk and early morning. The visual
enhancement for low-light hazy images is an ill-posed problem. Even though
numerous methods have been proposed for image dehazing and low-light
enhancement respectively, simply integrating them cannot deliver pleasing
results for this particular task. In this paper, we present a novel method to
enhance visibility for low-light hazy scenarios. To handle this challenging
task, we propose two key techniques, namely cross-consistency
dehazing-enhancement framework and physically based simulation for low-light
hazy dataset. Specifically, the framework is designed for enhancing visibility
of the input image via fully utilizing the clues from different sub-tasks. The
simulation is designed for generating the dataset with ground-truths by the

that the proposed method outperforms the SOTA solutions on different metrics

<p class="mathjax">The imposition of inhomogeneous Dirichlet (essential) boundary conditions is
a fundamental challenge in the application of Galerkin-type methods based on
non-interpolatory functions, i.e., functions which do not possess the Kronecker
delta property. Such functions typically are used in various meshfree methods,
as well as methods based on the isogeometric paradigm. The present paper
analyses a model problem consisting of the Poisson equation subject to
non-standard boundary conditions. Namely, instead of classical boundary
conditions, the model problem involves Dirichlet- and Neumann-type nonlocal
boundary conditions. Variational formulations with strongly and weakly imposed
inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type nonlocal conditions are derived and compared
within an extensive numerical study in the isogeometric framework based on
non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The attention in the numerical study is
paid mainly to the influence of the nonlocal boundary conditions on the
properties of the considered discretisation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving perception tasks rely heavily on cameras as the primary
sensor for Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation, and
Object Tracking. However, RGB images captured by cameras lack depth
information, which poses a significant challenge in 3D detection tasks. To
supplement this missing data, mapping sensors such as LIDAR and RADAR are used
for accurate 3D Object Detection. Despite their significant accuracy, the
multi-sensor models are expensive and require a high computational demand. In
contrast, Monocular 3D Object Detection models are becoming increasingly
popular, offering a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-implement solution for 3D
detections. This paper introduces a different Multi-Tasking Learning approach
called MonoNext that utilizes a spatial grid to map objects in the scene.
MonoNext employs a straightforward approach based on the ConvNext network and
requires only 3D bounding box annotated data. In our experiments with the KITTI
dataset, MonoNext achieved high precision and competitive performance
comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by adding more
training data, MonoNext surpassed itself and achieved higher accuracies.

<p class="mathjax">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Mesh is widely recognized as a driver technology
for IoT applications. However, the lack of quality of service (QoS) in BLE
Mesh, represented by packet prioritization, significantly limits its potential.
This work implements a quality-of-service (QoS) method for BLE Mesh to
prioritize the data packets and provide them with different network
transmission settings according to their assigned priority. Unlike existing
works on QoS for BLE Mesh, our proposed approach does not require any
modifications to the BLE Mesh protocol and can be smoothly adopted in existing
BLE Mesh networks. We conducted an extensive measurement campaign to evaluate
our solution over a 15-node BLE Mesh network deployed to emulate a smart
healthcare scenario where 45 sensors with an assigned priority transmit
information over the network. The experiments provide performance results for
single and multi channel network scenarios. The obtained results validate our
solution, showing the difference between the established priorities and
providing insights and guidelines to conduct further research on QoS over BLE
Mesh and broadcast-based networks.

<p class="mathjax">In legislative redistricting, most states draw their House and Senate maps
separately. Ohio and Wisconsin require that their Senate districts be made with
a 3:1 nesting rule, i.e., out of triplets of adjacent House districts. We seek
to study the impact of this requirement on redistricting, specifically on the
number of seats won by a particular political party. We compare two Markov
Chain Monte Carlo simulations, one which uses the ReCom chain to generate
Senate maps without a nesting requirement, and the other which uses a novel
chain that generates Senate maps with a 3:1 nesting requirement. Moreover, we
implement Ohio's constitutional county splitting requirements in both chains.
We find that requiring a 3:1 nesting rule has minimal impact on the
distribution of seats won. On the other hand, enforcing Ohio's county splitting
requirements severely restricts this distribution.

<p class="mathjax">Images are loaded with semantic information that pertains to real-world
ontologies: dog breeds share mammalian similarities, food pictures are often
depicted in domestic environments, and so on. However, when training machine
learning models for image classification, the relative similarities amongst
object classes are commonly paired with one-hot-encoded labels. According to
this logic, if an image is labelled as 'spoon', then 'tea-spoon' and 'shark'
are equally wrong in terms of training loss. To overcome this limitation, we
explore the integration of additional goals that reflect ontological and
semantic knowledge, improving model interpretability and trustworthiness. We
suggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional loss term
starting from any kind of semantic information about the classification label.
First, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings, and
discuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process.
Second, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, and
analyse the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internal
representations. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploited
in terms of explainability and adversarial robustness. Code repository:

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a research study on the use of Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0 and NASNetMobile models to
efficiently detect brain tumors in order to reduce the time required for manual
review of the report and create an automated system for classifying brain
tumors. An automated pipeline is proposed, which encompasses five models: CNN,
ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0 and NASNetMobile. The performance of the
proposed architecture is evaluated on a balanced dataset and found to yield an
accuracy of 99.33% for fine-tuned InceptionV3 model. Furthermore, Explainable
AI approaches are incorporated to visualize the model's latent behavior in
order to understand its black box behavior. To further optimize the training
process, a cost-sensitive neural network approach has been proposed in order to
work with imbalanced datasets which has achieved almost 4% more accuracy than
the conventional models used in our experiments. The cost-sensitive InceptionV3
(CS-InceptionV3) and CNN (CS-CNN) show a promising accuracy of 92.31% and a
recall value of 1.00 respectively on an imbalanced dataset. The proposed models
have shown great potential in improving tumor detection accuracy and must be
further developed for application in practical solutions. We have provided the
datasets and made our implementations publicly available at -

x_k}]_{j=0,1,\dots,m-1, k=1,2,\dots,s}$ for some set
$\mathcal{X}=\{x_k\}_{k=1}^s$ and $m\geq s$. A main result provides an explicit
lower bound for the smallest singular value of $\Phi$ under the assumption
$m\geq 6s$ and without any restrictions on $\mathcal{X}$. It shows that for an
appropriate scale $\tau$ determined by a density criteria, interactions between
elements in $\mathcal{X}$ at scales smaller than $\tau$ are most significant
and depends on the multiscale structure of $\mathcal{X}$ at fine scales, while
distances larger than $\tau$ are less important and only depend on the local
sparsity of the far away points. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show
that the main result significantly improves upon classical bounds and achieves
the same rate that was previously discovered for more restrictive settings.

<p class="mathjax">The atmospheric and water turbulence mitigation problems have emerged as
challenging inverse problems in computer vision and optics communities over the
years. However, current methods either rely heavily on the quality of the
training dataset or fail to generalize over various scenarios, such as static
scenes, dynamic scenes, and text reconstructions. We propose a general implicit
neural representation for unsupervised atmospheric and water turbulence
mitigation (NeRT). NeRT leverages the implicit neural representations and the
physically correct tilt-then-blur turbulence model to reconstruct the clean,
undistorted image, given only dozens of distorted input images. Moreover, we
show that NeRT outperforms the state-of-the-art through various qualitative and
quantitative evaluations of atmospheric and water turbulence datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of NeRT to eliminate uncontrolled
turbulence from real-world environments. Lastly, we incorporate NeRT into
continuously captured video sequences and demonstrate $48 \times$ speedup.

This achievement has garnered significant interest from companies and

emerged during this period, the majority of them have been trained primarily on
English data. Although they exhibit decent performance in other languages, such
as Chinese, their potential remains limited due to factors like vocabulary
design and training corpus. Consequently, their ability to fully express their
capabilities in Chinese falls short. To address this issue, we introduce the

<p class="mathjax">3D human pose estimation in outdoor environments has garnered increasing
attention recently. However, prevalent 3D human pose datasets pertaining to
outdoor scenes lack diversity, as they predominantly utilize only one type of
modality (RGB image or pointcloud), and often feature only one individual
within each scene. This limited scope of dataset infrastructure considerably
hinders the variability of available data. In this article, we propose
Human-M3, an outdoor multi-modal multi-view multi-person human pose database
which includes not only multi-view RGB videos of outdoor scenes but also
corresponding pointclouds. In order to obtain accurate human poses, we propose
an algorithm based on multi-modal data input to generate ground truth
annotation. This benefits from robust pointcloud detection and tracking, which
solves the problem of inaccurate human localization and matching ambiguity that
may exist in previous multi-view RGB videos in outdoor multi-person scenes, and
generates reliable ground truth annotations. Evaluation of multiple different
modalities algorithms has shown that this database is challenging and suitable
for future research. Furthermore, we propose a 3D human pose estimation
algorithm based on multi-modal data input, which demonstrates the advantages of
multi-modal data input for 3D human pose estimation. Code and data will be
released on https://github.com/soullessrobot/Human-M3-Dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Many approaches for optimizing decision making systems rely on gradient based
methods requiring informative feedback from the environment. However, in the
case where such feedback is sparse or uninformative, such approaches may result
in poor performance. Derivative-free approaches such as Bayesian Optimization
mitigate the dependency on the quality of gradient feedback, but are known to
scale poorly in the high-dimension setting of complex decision making systems.
This problem is exacerbated if the system requires interactions between several
actors cooperating to accomplish a shared goal. To address the dimensionality
challenge, we propose a compact multi-layered architecture modeling the
dynamics of actor interactions through the concept of role. Additionally, we
introduce Hessian-aware Bayesian Optimization to efficiently optimize the
multi-layered architecture parameterized by a large number of parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method (HA-GP-UCB) works effectively
on several benchmarks under resource constraints and malformed feedback
settings.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the design and development of an Anderson Accelerated
Preconditioned Modified Hermitian and Skew-Hermitian Splitting (AA-PMHSS)
method for solving complex-symmetric linear systems with application to
electromagnetics problems, such as wave scattering and eddy currents. While it
has been shown that the Anderson Acceleration of real linear systems is
essentially equivalent to GMRES, we show here that the formulation using
Anderson acceleration leads to a more performant method. We show relatively
good robustness compared to existing preconditioned GMRES methods and
significantly better performance due to the faster evaluation of the
preconditioner. In particular, AA-PMHSS can be applied to solve problems and
equations arising from electromagnetics, such as time-harmonic eddy current
simulations discretized with the Finite Element Method. We also evaluate three
test systems present in previous literature. We show that the method is
competitive with two types of preconditioned GMRES. One of the significant
advantages of these methods is that the convergence rate is independent of the
discretization size.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic grasping faces new challenges in human-robot-interaction scenarios.
We consider the task that the robot grasps a target object designated by
human's language directives. The robot not only needs to locate a target based
on vision-and-language information, but also needs to predict the reasonable
grasp pose candidate at various views and postures. In this work, we propose a
novel interactive grasp policy, named Visual-Lingual-Grasp (VL-Grasp), to grasp
the target specified by human language. First, we build a new challenging
visual grounding dataset to provide functional training data for robotic
interactive perception in indoor environments. Second, we propose a 6-Dof
interactive grasp policy combined with visual grounding and 6-Dof grasp pose
detection to extend the universality of interactive grasping. Third, we design
a grasp pose filter module to enhance the performance of the policy.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and extendibility of the VL-Grasp in
real world. The VL-Grasp achieves a success rate of 72.5\% in different indoor
scenes. The code and dataset is available at
https://github.com/luyh20/VL-Grasp.

<p class="mathjax">Advanced driving assistance systems are available on many late-model
vehicles, and automated driving systems are testing on public roads. Regulators
and developers continue to assess the safety of these vehicles by comparing
automated vehicle crash rates to baseline, human-driven crash rates. While
there are several widely-cited automated vehicle and conventional vehicle crash
databases, these databases have different underlying assumptions and inclusion
criteria. Crash rates among databases may be directly comparable only with
significant filtering and normalization, if at all. This paper reviews current
automated vehicle and baseline human-driven crash databases and evaluates their
comparability. Recommendations are presented to improve their comparability,
both in terms of normalization and contextualization, as well as additional
data fields that can be incorporated into existing databases. These findings
may assist researchers, regulators, and automated vehicle developers attempting
to evaluate the safety of driving automation systems.

<p class="mathjax">Optical character recognition (OCR) methods have been applied to diverse
tasks, e.g., street view text recognition and document analysis. Recently,
zero-shot OCR has piqued the interest of the research community because it
considers a practical OCR scenario with unbalanced data distribution. However,
there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating such zero-shot methods that apply
a divide-and-conquer recognition strategy by decomposing characters into
radicals. Meanwhile, radical recognition, as another important OCR task, also
lacks radical-level annotation for model training. In this paper, we construct
an ancient Chinese character image dataset that contains both radical-level and
character-level annotations to satisfy the requirements of the above-mentioned
methods, namely, ACCID, where radical-level annotations include radical
categories, radical locations, and structural relations. To increase the
adaptability of ACCID, we propose a splicing-based synthetic character
algorithm to augment the training samples and apply an image denoising method
to improve the image quality. By introducing character decomposition and
recombination, we propose a baseline method for zero-shot OCR. The experimental
results demonstrate the validity of ACCID and the baseline model quantitatively
and qualitatively.

communication technologies introduce the use of space- and airborne networks in
their architectures under the scope of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). With
this integration of satellite and aerial platform networks, better coverage,
network flexibility and easier deployment can be achieved. Correspondingly,
satellite broadband internet providers have launched an increasing number of
small satellites operating in low earth orbit (LEO). These recent developments
imply an increased electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure to humans and the
environment. In this work, we provide a short overview of the state of
consumer-grade satellite networks including broadband satellites and future NTN
services. We also consider the regulatory state governing their operation
within the context of EMF exposure. Finally, we highlight the aspects that are
relevant to the assessment of EMF exposure in relation to NTNs.

<p class="mathjax">A myriad of applications ranging from engineering and scientific simulations,
image and signal processing as well as high-sensitive data retrieval demand
high processing power reaching up to teraflops for their efficient execution.
While a standard serial computer would require clock-cycles of less than one
per second in this instance, parallel computing is a viable alternative. In
adopting parallelism, multiple architectural models such as the PRAM, BSP and
DataFlow Models have been proposed and implemented with some limitations due to
a number of factors. Perhaps one of the predominant causes is the presence of
sequential execution at some extent in these models. This status has trigged
the need for improved alternatives. Hence, the Arithmetic Deduction Model has
been introduced and its peculiarity can be seen through its use of natural
arithmetic concepts to perform computation, and the remarkable substitution or
elimination of dependency on variables and states in distributed data
processing. Although some initial results about its performance have been
published, it is critical to contextualize its genesis. Hence, in this paper we
explore the importance of high performance computing and conduct a comparative
study of some models of computation in terms of their strengh and limitations
and accordingly highlight the need for a new model of computation.

<p class="mathjax">For a long time, the Von Neumann has been a successful model of computation
for sequential computing .Many models including the dataflow model have been
unsuccessfully developed to emulate the same results in parallel computing. It
is widely accepted that high performance computation is better-achieved using
parallel architectures and is seen as the basis for future computational
architectures with the ever-increasing need for high performance computation.
We describe a new model of parallel computation known as the Arithmetic
Deduction Model (AriDem) which has some similarities with the Von Neumann. A
theoretical evaluation conducted on this model in comparison with the
predominant von Neumann model indicated AriDeM to be more efficient in
resources utilization. In this paper, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the
model and the results reflect the output of the theoretical evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Today, there are a plethora of In-Memory Computing (IMC) devices- SRAMs, PCMs
&amp; FeFETs, that emulate convolutions on crossbar-arrays with high throughput.
Each IMC device offers its own pros &amp; cons during inference of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) on crossbars in terms of area overhead, programming energy and
non-idealities. A design-space exploration is, therefore, imperative to derive
a hybrid-device architecture optimized for accurate DNN inference under the
impact of non-idealities from multiple devices, while maintaining competitive
area &amp; energy-efficiencies. We propose a two-phase search framework (HyDe) that
exploits the best of all worlds offered by multiple devices to determine an
optimal hybrid-device architecture for a given DNN topology. Our hybrid models
achieve upto 2.30-2.74x higher TOPS/mm^2 at 22-26% higher energy-efficiencies
than baseline homogeneous models for a VGG16 DNN topology. We further propose a
feasible implementation of the HyDe-derived hybrid-device architectures in the
2.5D design space using chiplets to reduce design effort and cost in the
hardware fabrication involving multiple technology processes.

<p class="mathjax">Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing
bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems. Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a
biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of
inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs. If a bug
is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed
automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. Like fuzzing, many
existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than
inputs.
<br />In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.
The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather
than the input space. Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch
space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch
candidates and help in patch selection. To improve the throughput, we propose a
compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original
(unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific
patched statements and expressions. Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show
that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as
input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec). We show that patch-level
fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both
spaces in order to find better quality patches. Such a collaboration between
input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over
candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.

for active learning in genetic programming. We found that the model population
in genetic programming can be exploited to select informative training data
points by using a model ensemble combined with an uncertainty metric. We
explored several uncertainty metrics and found that differential entropy
performed the best. We also compared two data diversity metrics and found that
correlation as a diversity metric performs better than minimum Euclidean
distance, although there are some drawbacks that prevent correlation from being
used on all problems. Finally, we combined uncertainty and diversity using a
Pareto optimization approach to allow both to be considered in a balanced way
to guide the selection of informative and unique data points for training.

<p class="mathjax">Sixth-order boundary value problems (BVPs) arise in thin-film flows with a
surface that has elastic bending resistance. To solve such problems, we first
derive a complete set of odd and even orthonormal eigenfunctions -- resembling
trigonometric sines and cosines, as well as the so-called ``beam'' functions.
These functions intrinsically satisfy boundary conditions (BCs) of relevance to
thin-film flows, since they are the solutions of a self-adjoint sixth-order
Sturm--Liouville BVP with the same BCs. Next, we propose a Galerkin spectral
approach for sixth-order problems; namely the sought function as well as all
its derivatives and terms appearing in the differential equation are expanded
into an infinite series with respect to the derived complete orthonormal (CON)
set of eigenfunctions. The unknown coefficients in the series expansion are
determined by solving the algebraic system derived by taking successive inner
products with each member of the CON set of eigenfunctions. The proposed method
and its convergence are demonstrated by solving two model sixth-order BVPs.

<p class="mathjax">Today, large language models (LLMs) are taught to use new tools by providing
a few demonstrations of the tool's usage. Unfortunately, demonstrations are
hard to acquire, and can result in undesirable biased usage if the wrong
demonstration is chosen. Even in the rare scenario that demonstrations are
readily available, there is no principled selection protocol to determine how
many and which ones to provide. As tasks grow more complex, the selection
search grows combinatorially and invariably becomes intractable. Our work
provides an alternative to demonstrations: tool documentation. We advocate the
use of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, over
demonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findings
on 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existing
benchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient for
eliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shot
prompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundreds
of available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly more
valuable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantly
outperforming few-shot without documentation. Third, we highlight the benefits
of tool documentations by tackling image generation and video tracking using
just-released unseen state-of-the-art models as tools. Finally, we highlight
the possibility of using tool documentation to automatically enable new
applications: by using nothing more than the documentation of GroundingDino,
Stable Diffusion, XMem, and SAM, LLMs can re-invent the functionalities of the
just-released Grounded-SAM and Track Anything models.

<p class="mathjax">It is often useful to have polynomial upper or lower bounds on a
one-dimensional function that are valid over a finite interval, called a trust
region. A classical way to produce polynomial bounds of degree $k$ involves
bounding the range of the $k$th derivative over the trust region, but this
produces suboptimal bounds. We improve on this by deriving sharp polynomial
upper and lower bounds for a wide variety of one-dimensional functions. We
further show that sharp bounds of degree $k$ are at least $k+1$ times tighter
than those produced by the classical method, asymptotically as the width of the
trust region approaches zero. We discuss how these sharp bounds can be used in
majorization-minimization optimization, among other applications.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computing paradigm that
imitates the brain's structure to offer a powerful and efficient processing and
learning model. In HDC, the data are encoded with long vectors, called
hypervectors, typically with a length of 1K to 10K. The literature provides
several encoding techniques to generate orthogonal or correlated hypervectors,
depending on the intended application. The existing surveys in the literature
often focus on the overall aspects of HDC systems, including system inputs,
primary computations, and final outputs. However, this study takes a more
specific approach. It zeroes in on the HDC system input and the generation of
hypervectors, directly influencing the hypervector encoding process. This
survey brings together various methods for hypervector generation from
different studies and explores the limitations, challenges, and potential
benefits they entail. Through a comprehensive exploration of this survey,
readers will acquire a profound understanding of various encoding types in HDC
and gain insights into the intricate process of hypervector generation for
diverse applications.

<p class="mathjax">Audit trails are evidential indications of activities performers in any logs.
Modern reactive systems such as transaction processing systems, management
information systems, decision support systems and even executive management
systems log activities of users as they perform their daily tasks for a number
of reasons and perhaps one of the most important is security. In order to
efficiently monitor and manage privacy and access to information, the trails as
captured and recorded in these logs play a pivotal role in this regard. In Open
Source realm, however, this is not the case. Although the objective with free
software is to allow for access, free distribution and the rights to modify
coding, having such audit trails can help to trace and understand how active
members of these communities are and the type of activities they perform. In
this paper, we propose using process mining to construct logs using as much
data as can be found in open source repositories in order to produce a process
model, also called a workflow net that graphical depicts the sequential
occurrence of developers activities. Our method is exhibited through a simple
algorithm called Act-Trace.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is vital for robot localization. To date, the
most performant VPR approaches are environment- and task-specific: while they
exhibit strong performance in structured environments (predominantly urban
driving), their performance degrades severely in unstructured environments,
rendering most approaches brittle to robust real-world deployment. In this
work, we develop a universal solution to VPR -- a technique that works across a
broad range of structured and unstructured environments (urban, outdoors,
indoors, aerial, underwater, and subterranean environments) without any
re-training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that general-purpose feature
representations derived from off-the-shelf self-supervised models with no
VPR-specific training are the right substrate upon which to build such a
universal VPR solution. Combining these derived features with unsupervised
feature aggregation enables our suite of methods, AnyLoc, to achieve up to 4X
significantly higher performance than existing approaches. We further obtain a
6% improvement in performance by characterizing the semantic properties of
these features, uncovering unique domains which encapsulate datasets from
similar environments. Our detailed experiments and analysis lay a foundation
for building VPR solutions that may be deployed anywhere, anytime, and across
anyview. We encourage the readers to explore our project page and interactive
demos: https://anyloc.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">The Democratic Republic of Congo is a sleeping giant at the heart of Africa.
Though endowed with incredible natural resources spanning from significant
reserves of gold, diamond, coltan, copper to vast African forests and
impressive water resources, it is still considered as one of the poorest
countries on the planet. For a long time, its economy has had nothing to show
for all these resources as the Congolese people continue to live in extreme
poverty. To survive, the Congolese people engage in a range of activities to
generate income and most families rely on 'solidarity grants' from family
members and relatives that either work or conduct a personal business. Most of
these families remain unbanked. Due to the absence of reliable and private
financial institutions, almost 90% of all financial transactions are
cash-based. However, as the number of banks increases throughout the past few
years, there is a possibility to encourage and perform cashless transactions.
In this paper, we demonstrate an implementation of a Service-Oriented
Architecture approach in the design of a eWallet system. A typical scenario has
been presented to highlight the major components of the system to be
implemented as contextualized in the ecosystem. A series of models, from the
business processes to the technical architecture and service model for the
system, has been developed to represent every step of the solution.
<br />The paper is structured as follows: In section 1, we give a brief
introduction of the paper, section 2 gives a generic description and
contextualization of eWallet, section 3 gives a description of the scenario as
chosen for this case study, section 4 describes the ecosystem for the scenario,

<p class="mathjax">Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, they still rely on explicit human instruction to identify the target
objects or categories before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems
lack the ability to actively reason and comprehend implicit user intentions. In
this work, we propose a new segmentation task -- reasoning segmentation. The
task is designed to output a segmentation mask given a complex and implicit
query text. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark comprising over one thousand
image-instruction pairs, incorporating intricate reasoning and world knowledge
for evaluation purposes. Finally, we present LISA: large Language Instructed
Segmentation Assistant, which inherits the language generation capabilities of
the multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) while also possessing the ability to
produce segmentation masks. We expand the original vocabulary with a &lt;SEG&gt;
token and propose the embedding-as-mask paradigm to unlock the segmentation
capability. Remarkably, LISA can handle cases involving: 1) complex reasoning;
2) world knowledge; 3) explanatory answers; 4) multi-turn conversation. Also,
it demonstrates robust zero-shot capability when trained exclusively on
reasoning-free datasets. In addition, fine-tuning the model with merely 239
reasoning segmentation image-instruction pairs results in further performance
enhancement. Experiments show our method not only unlocks new reasoning
segmentation capabilities but also proves effective in both complex reasoning
segmentation and standard referring segmentation tasks. Code, models, and demo
are at https://github.com/dvlab-research/LISA.

<p class="mathjax">One-bit quantization with time-varying sampling thresholds (also known as
random dithering) has recently found significant utilization potential in
statistical signal processing applications due to its relatively low power
consumption and low implementation cost. In addition to such advantages, an
attractive feature of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is their
superior sampling rates as compared to their conventional multi-bit
counterparts. This characteristic endows one-bit signal processing frameworks
with what one may refer to as sample abundance. We show that sample abundance
plays a pivotal role in many signal recovery and optimization problems that are
formulated as (possibly non-convex) quadratic programs with linear feasibility
constraints. Of particular interest to our work are low-rank matrix recovery
and compressed sensing applications that take advantage of one-bit
quantization. We demonstrate that the sample abundance paradigm allows for the
transformation of such problems to merely linear feasibility problems by
forming large-scale overdetermined linear systems -- thus removing the need for
handling costly optimization constraints and objectives. To make the proposed
computational cost savings achievable, we offer enhanced randomized Kaczmarz
algorithms to solve these highly overdetermined feasibility problems and
provide theoretical guarantees in terms of their convergence, sample size
requirements, and overall performance. Several numerical results are presented
to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.

<p class="mathjax">The morphology and distribution of airway tree abnormalities enables
diagnosis and disease characterisation across a variety of chronic respiratory
conditions. In this regard, airway segmentation plays a critical role in the
production of the outline of the entire airway tree to enable estimation of
disease extent and severity. In this study, we propose a data-centric deep
learning technique to segment the airway tree. The proposed technique utilises
interpolation and image split to improve data usefulness and quality. Then, an
ensemble learning strategy is implemented to aggregate the segmented airway
trees at different scales. In terms of segmentation performance (dice
similarity coefficient), our method outperforms the baseline model by 2.5% on
average when a combined loss is used. Further, our proposed technique has a low
GPU usage and high flexibility enabling it to be deployed on any 2D deep
learning model.

<p class="mathjax">The ultra-secure quantum network leverages quantum mechanical concepts to
deliver unsurpassed data transfer security. In principle, the well-known
quantum key distribution (QKD) achieves unconditional security, which raises
concerns about the trustworthiness of 6G wireless systems. The long-distance
satellite-to-ground evolving quantum network distributes keys that are
ubiquitous to the node on the ground through low-orbit satellites. As the
secret key sequence is encoded into quantum states, it is sent through the
atmosphere via a quantum channel. However, achieving high-quality quantum
communication requires more effort in deployment ranges, physical layer
transmission, and security. In this paper, we first study the quantum states
and channel properties for satellite-based QKD networks and long-range quantum
state transfer (QST). Moreover, we highlight some challenges, such as
transmissivity statistics, estimation of channel parameters and attack
resilience, quantum state transfer for satellite-based QKD networks, and
wavepacket shaping techniques over atmospheric channels. Furthermore, we
underline two open challenges that consider the QST to the atmospheric
transmission and wavepacket shaping techniques via atmospheric channels in
order to encourage further research toward the next generation of
satellite-based QKD networks.

<p class="mathjax">Which technological linkages affect the sector's ability to innovate? How do
these effects transmit through the technology space? This paper answers these
two key questions using novel methods of text mining and network analysis. We
examine technological interdependence across sectors over a period of half a
century (from 1976 to 2021) by analyzing the text of 6.5 million patents
granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and applying
network analysis to uncover the full spectrum of linkages existing across
technology areas. We demonstrate that patent text contains a wealth of
information often not captured by traditional innovation metrics, such as
patent citations. By using network analysis, we document that indirect linkages
are as important as direct connections and that the former would remain mostly
hidden using more traditional measures of indirect linkages, such as the
Leontief inverse matrix. Finally, based on an impulse-response analysis, we
illustrate how technological shocks transmit through the technology
(network-based) space, affecting the innovation capacity of the sectors.

new alphas (effective trading signals or factors). Traditional alpha mining
methods, either hand-crafted factor synthesizing or algorithmic factor mining

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, deep neural networks are yielding better performance in
image classification tasks. However, the increasing complexity of datasets and
the demand for improved performance necessitate the exploration of innovative
techniques. The present work proposes a new deep neural network (called as,
T-Fusion Net) that augments multiple localizations based spatial attention.
This attention mechanism allows the network to focus on relevant image regions,
improving its discriminative power. A homogeneous ensemble of the said network
is further used to enhance image classification accuracy. For ensembling, the
proposed approach considers multiple instances of individual T-Fusion Net. The
model incorporates fuzzy max fusion to merge the outputs of individual nets.
The fusion process is optimized through a carefully chosen parameter to strike
a balance on the contributions of the individual models. Experimental
evaluations on benchmark Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 CT scan) dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed T-Fusion Net as well as its ensemble. The
proposed T-Fusion Net and the homogeneous ensemble model exhibit better
performance, as compared to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy
of 97.59% and 98.4%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Financial risk prediction plays a crucial role in the financial sector.
Machine learning methods have been widely applied for automatically detecting
potential risks and thus saving the cost of labor. However, the development in
this field is lagging behind in recent years by the following two facts: 1) the
algorithms used are somewhat outdated, especially in the context of the fast
advance of generative AI and large language models (LLMs); 2) the lack of a
unified and open-sourced financial benchmark has impeded the related research
for years. To tackle these issues, we propose FinPT and FinBench: the former is
a novel approach for financial risk prediction that conduct Profile Tuning on
large pretrained foundation models, and the latter is a set of high-quality
datasets on financial risks such as default, fraud, and churn. In FinPT, we
fill the financial tabular data into the pre-defined instruction template,
obtain natural-language customer profiles by prompting LLMs, and fine-tune
large foundation models with the profile text to make predictions. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FinPT by experimenting with a
range of representative strong baselines on FinBench. The analytical studies
further deepen the understanding of LLMs for financial risk prediction.

<p class="mathjax">To understand the structure of a network, it can be useful to break it down
into its constituent pieces. This is the approach taken in a multitude of
successful network analysis methods, such as motif analysis. These methods
require one to enumerate or sample small connected subgraphs of a network,
which can be computationally intractable if naive methods are used. Efficient
algorithms exists for both enumeration and uniform sampling of subgraphs, and
here we generalize the ESU algorithm for a very general notion of multilayer
networks. We show that multilayer network subnetwork enumeration introduces
nontrivial complications to the existing algorithm, and present two different
generalized algorithms that preserve the desired features of unbiased sampling
and trivial parallelization. We evaluate these algorithms in synthetic networks
and with real-world data, and show that neither of the algorithms is strictly
more efficient but rather the choice depends on the features of the data.
Having a general algorithm for finding subnetworks makes advanced multilayer
network analysis possible, and enables researchers to apply a variety of
methods to previously difficult-to-handle multilayer networks in a variety of
domains and across many different types of multilayer networks.

<p class="mathjax">There has been a resurgence of interest in optical computing over the past
decade, both in academia and in industry, with much of the excitement centered
around special-purpose optical computers for neural-network processing. Optical
computing has been a topic of periodic study for over 50 years, including for
neural networks three decades ago, and a wide variety of optical-computing
schemes and architectures have been proposed. In this paper we provide a
systematic explanation of why and how optics might be able to give speed or
energy-efficiency benefits over electronics for computing, enumerating 11
features of optics that can be harnessed when designing an optical computer.
One often-mentioned motivation for optical computing -- that the speed of light
$c$ is fast -- is not a key differentiating physical property of optics for
computing; understanding where an advantage could come from is more subtle. We
discuss how gaining an advantage over state-of-the-art electronic processors
will likely only be achievable by careful design that harnesses more than one
of the 11 features, while avoiding a number of pitfalls that we describe.

<p class="mathjax">Brain tumor segmentation is an active research area due to the difficulty in
delineating highly complex shaped and textured tumors as well as the failure of
the commonly used U-Net architectures. The combination of different neural
architectures is among the mainstream research recently, particularly the
combination of U-Net with Transformers because of their innate attention
mechanism and pixel-wise labeling. Different from previous efforts, this paper
proposes a novel network architecture that integrates Transformers into a
self-adaptive U-Net to draw out 3D volumetric contexts with reasonable
computational costs. We further add a residual connection to prevent
degradation in information flow and explore ensemble methods, as the evaluated
models have edges on different cases and sub-regions. On the BraTS 2021 dataset
(3D), our model achieves 87.6% mean Dice score and outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential for combining multiple
architectures to optimize brain tumor segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">This thesis focuses on representation learning for sequence data over time or
space, aiming to improve downstream sequence prediction tasks by using the
learned representations. Supervised learning has been the most dominant
approach for training deep neural networks for learning good sequential
representations. However, one limiting factor to scale supervised learning is
the lack of enough annotated data. Motivated by this challenge, it is natural
to explore representation learning methods that can utilize large amounts of
unlabeled and weakly labeled data, as well as an additional data modality. I
describe my broad study of representation learning for speech data. Unlike most
other works that focus on a single learning setting, this thesis studies
multiple settings: supervised learning with auxiliary losses, unsupervised
learning, semi-supervised learning, and multi-view learning. Besides different
learning problems, I also explore multiple approaches for representation
learning. Though I focus on speech data, the methods described in this thesis
can also be applied to other domains. Overall, the field of representation
learning is developing rapidly. State-of-the-art results on speech related
tasks are typically based on Transformers pre-trained with large-scale
self-supervised learning, which aims to learn generic representations that can
benefit multiple downstream tasks. Since 2020, large-scale pre-training has
been the de facto choice to achieve good performance. This delayed thesis does
not attempt to summarize and compare with the latest results on speech
representation learning; instead, it presents a unique study on speech
representation learning before the Transformer era, that covers multiple
learning settings. Some of the findings in this thesis can still be useful
today.

<p class="mathjax">The proper conflict-free chromatic number, $\chi_{pcf}(G)$, of a graph $G$ is
the least $k$ such that $G$ has a proper $k$-coloring in which for each
non-isolated vertex there is a color appearing exactly once among its
neighbors. The proper odd chromatic number, $\chi_{o}(G)$, of $G$ is the least
$k$ such that $G$ has a proper coloring in which for every non-isolated vertex
there is a color appearing an odd number of times among its neighbors. We say
that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded ($\chi_{o}$-bounded)
if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi_{pcf}(G) \leq f(\chi(G))$
($\chi_{o}(G) \leq f(\chi(G))$) for every $G \in \mathcal{G}$. Caro et al.
(2022) asked for classes that are linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded
($\chi_{pcf}$-bounded), and as a starting point, they showed that every
claw-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le 2\Delta(G)+1$, which implies
$\chi_{pcf}(G) \le 4\chi(G)+1$. They also conjectured that any graph $G$ with
$\Delta(G) \ge 3$ satisfies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le \Delta(G)+1$. In this paper, we
improve the bound for claw-free graphs to a nearly tight bound by showing that
such a graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le \Delta(G)+6$, and even
$\chi_{pcf}(G) \le \Delta(G)+4$ if it is a quasi-line graph. Moreover, we show
that convex-round graphs and permutation graphs are linearly
$\chi_{pcf}$-bounded. For these last two results, we prove a lemma that reduces
the problem of deciding if a hereditary class is linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded
to deciding if the bipartite graphs in the class are $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded by an
absolute constant. This lemma complements a theorem of Liu (2022) and motivates
us to further study boundedness in bipartite graphs. So among other results, we
show that convex bipartite graphs are not $\chi_{o}$-bounded, and a class of
bipartite circle graphs that is linearly $\chi_{o}$-bounded but not
$\chi_{pcf}$-bounded.

development of ultrafast artificial neural networks. Leveraging the benefits of
photonics such as high-bandwidth, low latencies, low-energy interconnect and
high speed they can overcome the existing limits of the electronic processing.
To satisfy all these requirements a new photonic platform is proposed that
combines low-loss nitride-rich silicon as a guide and low-loss transparent

<p class="mathjax">Majorization-minimization (MM) is a family of optimization methods that
iteratively reduce a loss by minimizing a locally-tight upper bound, called a
majorizer. Traditionally, majorizers were derived by hand, and MM was only
applicable to a small number of well-studied problems. We present optimizers
that instead derive majorizers automatically, using a recent generalization of
Taylor mode automatic differentiation. These universal MM optimizers can be
applied to arbitrary problems and converge from any starting point, with no

<p class="mathjax">Blood vessel segmentation in medical imaging is one of the essential steps
for vascular disease diagnosis and interventional planning in a broad spectrum
of clinical scenarios in image-based medicine and interventional medicine.
Unfortunately, manual annotation of the vessel masks is challenging and
resource-intensive due to subtle branches and complex structures. To overcome
this issue, this paper presents a self-supervised vessel segmentation method,
dubbed the contrastive diffusion adversarial representation learning (C-DARL)
model. Our model is composed of a diffusion module and a generation module that
learns the distribution of multi-domain blood vessel data by generating
synthetic vessel images from diffusion latent. Moreover, we employ contrastive
learning through a mask-based contrastive loss so that the model can learn more
realistic vessel representations. To validate the efficacy, C-DARL is trained
using various vessel datasets, including coronary angiograms, abdominal digital
subtraction angiograms, and retinal imaging. Experimental results confirm that
our model achieves performance improvement over baseline methods with noise
robustness, suggesting the effectiveness of C-DARL for vessel segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Near-term quantum computations are limited by high error rates, the scarcity
of qubits and low qubit connectivity. Increasing support for mid-circuit
measurements and qubit reset in near-term quantum computers enables qubit reuse
that may yield quantum computations with fewer qubits and lower errors. In this
work, we introduce a formal model for qubit reuse optimization that delivers
provably optimal solutions with respect to quantum circuit depth, number of
qubits, or number of swap gates for the first time. This is in contrast to
related work where qubit reuse is used heuristically or optimally but without
consideration of the mapping effort. We further investigate reset errors on
near-term quantum computers by performing reset error characterization
experiments. Using the hereby obtained reset error characterization and
calibration data of a near-term quantum computer, we then determine a qubit
assignment that is optimal with respect to a given cost function. We define
this cost function to include gate errors and decoherence as well as the
individual reset error of each qubit. We found the reset fidelity to be
state-dependent and to range, depending on the reset qubit, from 67.5% to 100%
in a near-term quantum computer. We demonstrate the applicability of the
developed method to a number of quantum circuits and show improvements in the
number of qubits and swap gate insertions, estimated success probability, and
Hellinger fidelity of the investigated quantum circuits.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning offers potential for various healthcare applications involving
the human skull but requires extensive datasets of curated medical images. To
overcome this challenge, we propose SkullGAN, a generative adversarial network
(GAN), to create large datasets of synthetic skull CT slices, reducing reliance
on real images and accelerating the integration of machine learning into
healthcare. In our method, CT slices of 38 subjects were fed to SkullGAN, a
neural network comprising over 200 million parameters. The synthetic skull
images generated were evaluated based on three quantitative radiological
features: skull density ratio (SDR), mean thickness, and mean intensity. They
were further analyzed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
and by applying the SkullGAN discriminator as a classifier. The results showed
that SkullGAN-generated images demonstrated similar key quantitative
radiological features to real skulls. Further definitive analysis was
undertaken by applying the discriminator of SkullGAN, where the SkullGAN
discriminator classified 56.5% of a test set of real skull images and 55.9% of
the SkullGAN-generated images as reals (the theoretical optimum being 50%),
demonstrating that the SkullGAN-generated skull set is indistinguishable from
the real skull set - within the limits of our nonlinear classifier. Therefore,
SkullGAN makes it possible to generate large numbers of synthetic skull CT
segments, necessary for training neural networks for medical applications
involving the human skull. This mitigates challenges associated with preparing
large, high-quality training datasets, such as access, capital, time, and the
need for domain expertise.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis. However,
current losses for medical image segmentation mainly focus on overall
segmentation results, with fewer losses proposed to guide boundary
segmentation. Those that do exist often need to be used in combination with
other losses and produce ineffective results. To address this issue, we have
developed a simple and effective loss called the Boundary Difference over Union
Loss (Boundary DoU Loss) to guide boundary region segmentation. It is obtained
by calculating the ratio of the difference set of prediction and ground truth
to the union of the difference set and the partial intersection set. Our loss
only relies on region calculation, making it easy to implement and training
stable without needing any additional losses. Additionally, we use the target
size to adaptively adjust attention applied to the boundary regions.
Experimental results using UNet, TransUNet, and Swin-UNet on two datasets (ACDC
and Synapse) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss function. Code
is available at https://github.com/sunfan-bvb/BoundaryDoULoss.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of deep learning has brought a revolutionary transformation to
image denoising techniques. However, the persistent challenge of acquiring
noise-clean pairs for supervised methods in real-world scenarios remains
formidable, necessitating the exploration of more practical self-supervised
image denoising. This paper focuses on self-supervised image denoising methods
that offer effective solutions to address this challenge. Our comprehensive
review thoroughly analyzes the latest advancements in self-supervised image
denoising approaches, categorizing them into three distinct classes: General
methods, Blind Spot Network (BSN)-based methods, and Transformer-based methods.
For each class, we provide a concise theoretical analysis along with their
practical applications. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we
present both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on various
datasets, utilizing classical algorithms as benchmarks. Additionally, we
critically discuss the current limitations of these methods and propose
promising directions for future research. By offering a detailed overview of
recent developments in self-supervised image denoising, this review serves as
an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field,
facilitating a deeper understanding of this emerging domain and inspiring
further advancements.

<p class="mathjax">In high-dimensional generalized linear models, it is crucial to identify a
sparse model that adequately accounts for response variation. Although the best
subset section has been widely regarded as the Holy Grail of problems of this
type, achieving either computational efficiency or statistical guarantees is
challenging. In this article, we intend to surmount this obstacle by utilizing
a fast algorithm to select the best subset with high certainty. We proposed and
illustrated an algorithm for best subset recovery in regularity conditions.
Under mild conditions, the computational complexity of our algorithm scales
polynomially with sample size and dimension. In addition to demonstrating the
statistical properties of our method, extensive numerical experiments reveal
that it outperforms existing methods for variable selection and coefficient
estimation. The runtime analysis shows that our implementation achieves
approximately a fourfold speedup compared to popular variable selection
toolkits like glmnet and ncvreg.

<p class="mathjax">Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a novel and effective screening tool
for ophthalmic examination. Since collecting OCT images is relatively more
expensive than fundus photographs, existing methods use multi-modal learning to
complement limited OCT data with additional context from fundus images.
However, the multi-modal framework requires eye-paired datasets of both
modalities, which is impractical for clinical use. To address this problem, we
propose a novel fundus-enhanced disease-aware distillation model (FDDM), for
retinal disease classification from OCT images. Our framework enhances the OCT
model during training by utilizing unpaired fundus images and does not require
the use of fundus images during testing, which greatly improves the
practicality and efficiency of our method for clinical use. Specifically, we
propose a novel class prototype matching to distill disease-related information
from the fundus model to the OCT model and a novel class similarity alignment
to enforce consistency between disease distribution of both modalities.
Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms single-modal,
multi-modal, and state-of-the-art distillation methods for retinal disease
classification. Code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/FDDM.

<p class="mathjax">The extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) is a very popular method to
obtain data-driven surrogate models for nonlinear (control) systems governed by
ordinary and stochastic differential equations. Its theoretical foundation is
the Koopman framework, in which one propagates observable functions of the
state to obtain a linear representation in an infinite-dimensional space. In
this work, we prove practical asymptotic stability of a (controlled)
equilibrium for eDMD-based model predictive control, in which the optimization
step is conducted using the data-based surrogate model. To this end, we derive
error bounds that converge to zero if the state approaches the desired
equilibrium. Further, we show that, if the underlying system is cost
controllable, then this stabilizablility property is preserved. We conduct
numerical simulations, which illustrate the proven practical asymptotic

<p class="mathjax">Finding a high-quality feasible solution to a combinatorial optimization (CO)
problem in a limited time is challenging due to its discrete nature. Recently,
there has been an increasing number of machine learning (ML) methods for
addressing CO problems. Neural diving (ND) is one of the learning-based
approaches to generating partial discrete variable assignments in Mixed Integer
Programs (MIP), a framework for modeling CO problems. However, a major drawback
of ND is a large discrepancy between the ML and MIP objectives, i.e., variable
value classification accuracy over primal bound. Our study investigates that a
specific range of variable assignment rates (coverage) yields high-quality
feasible solutions, where we suggest optimizing the coverage bridges the gap
between the learning and MIP objectives. Consequently, we introduce a post-hoc
method and a learning-based approach for optimizing the coverage. A key idea of
our approach is to jointly learn to restrict the coverage search space and to
predict the coverage in the learned search space. Experimental results
demonstrate that learning a deep neural network to estimate the coverage for
finding high-quality feasible solutions achieves state-of-the-art performance
in NeurIPS ML4CO datasets. In particular, our method shows outstanding
performance in the workload apportionment dataset, achieving the optimality gap
of 0.45%, a ten-fold improvement over SCIP within the one-minute time limit.

<p class="mathjax">We are interested in numerically solving a transitional model derived from
the Bloch model. The Bloch equation describes the time evolution of the density
matrix of a quantum system forced by an electromagnetic wave. In a high
frequency and low amplitude regime, it asymptotically reduces to a non-stiff
rate equation. As a middle ground, the transitional model governs the diagonal
part of the density matrix. It fits in a general setting of linear problems
with a high-frequency quasi-periodic forcing and an exponentially decaying
forcing. The numerical resolution of such problems is challenging. Adapting
high-order averaging techniques to this setting, we separate the slow (rate)
dynamics from the fast (oscillatory and decay) dynamics to derive a new
micro-macro problem. We derive estimates for the size of the micro part of the
decomposition, and of its time derivatives, showing that this new problem is
non-stiff. As such, we may solve this micro-macro problem with uniform accuracy
using standard numerical schemes. To validate this approach, we present
numerical results first on a toy problem and then on the transitional Bloch
model.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a new radiometric fingerprint that is revealed by
micro-signals in the channel state information (CSI) curves extracted from
commodity Wi-Fi devices. We refer to this new fingerprint as "micro-CSI". Our
experiments show that micro-CSI is likely to be caused by imperfections in the
radio-frequency circuitry and is present in Wi-Fi 4/5/6 network interface cards
(NICs). We conducted further experiments to determine the most effective CSI
collection configuration to stabilize micro-CSI. To extract micro-CSI from
varying CSI curves, we developed a signal space-based extraction algorithm that
effectively separates distortions caused by wireless channels and hardware
imperfections under line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios. Finally, we implemented a
micro-CSI-based device authentication algorithm that uses the k-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) method to identify 11 COTS Wi-Fi NICs from the same
manufacturer in typical indoor environments. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the micro-CSI-based authentication algorithm can achieve an
average attack detection rate of over 99% with a false alarm rate of 0%.

<p class="mathjax">Image synthesis is increasingly being adopted in medical image processing,
for example for data augmentation or inter-modality image translation. In these
critical applications, the generated images must fulfill a high standard of
biological correctness. A particular requirement for these images is global
consistency, i.e an image being overall coherent and structured so that all
parts of the image fit together in a realistic and meaningful way. Yet,
established image quality metrics do not explicitly quantify this property of
synthetic images. In this work, we introduce two metrics that can measure the
global consistency of synthetic images on a per-image basis. To measure the
global consistency, we presume that a realistic image exhibits consistent
properties, e.g., a person's body fat in a whole-body MRI, throughout the
depicted object or scene. Hence, we quantify global consistency by predicting
and comparing explicit attributes of images on patches using supervised trained
neural networks. Next, we adapt this strategy to an unlabeled setting by
measuring the similarity of implicit image features predicted by a
self-supervised trained network. Our results demonstrate that predicting
explicit attributes of synthetic images on patches can distinguish globally
consistent from inconsistent images. Implicit representations of images are
less sensitive to assess global consistency but are still serviceable when
labeled data is unavailable. Compared to established metrics, such as the FID,
our method can explicitly measure global consistency on a per-image basis,
enabling a dedicated analysis of the biological plausibility of single
synthetic images.

unsustainable level at an accelerated pace. The detection, tracking,
identification, and differentiation between orbit-defined, registered
spacecraft, and rogue/inactive space ``objects'', is critical to asset
protection. The primary objective of this work is to investigate the validity
of Deep Neural Network (DNN) solutions to overcome the limitations and image
artefacts most prevalent when captured with monocular cameras in the visible
light spectrum. In this work, a hybrid UNet-ResNet34 Deep Learning (DL)
architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is developed. Image
degradations addressed include blurring, exposure issues, poor contrast, and
noise. The shortage of space-generated data suitable for supervised DL is also
addressed. A visual comparison between the URes34P model developed in this work
and the existing state of the art in deep learning image enhancement methods,
relevant to images captured in space, is presented. Based upon visual
inspection, it is determined that our UNet model is capable of correcting for
space-related image degradations and merits further investigation to reduce its
computational complexity.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for the spatio-temporal
reconstruction of sound fields using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
The method utilises a plane wave basis and learns the underlying statistical
distributions of pressure in rooms to accurately reconstruct sound fields from
a limited number of measurements. The performance of the method is evaluated
using two established datasets and compared to state-of-the-art methods. The
results show that the model is able to achieve an improved reconstruction
performance in terms of accuracy and energy retention, particularly in the
high-frequency range and when extrapolating beyond the measurement region.
Furthermore, the proposed method can handle a varying number of measurement
positions and configurations without sacrificing performance. The results
suggest that this approach provides a promising approach to sound field
reconstruction using generative models that allow for a physically informed
prior to acoustics problems.

<p class="mathjax">Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic
imaging technique that first needs intravenously administration of an iodinated
contrast medium; then, it collects bot a low-energy image, comparable to
standard mammography, and a high-energy image. The two scans are then combined
to get a recombined image showing contrast enhancement. Despite CESM diagnostic
advantages for breast cancer diagnosis, the use of contrast medium can cause
side effects, and CESM also beams patients with a higher radiation dose
compared to standard mammography. To address these limitations this work
proposes to use deep generative models for virtual contrast enhancement on
CESM, aiming to make the CESM contrast-free as well as to reduce the radiation
dose. Our deep networks, consisting of an autoencoder and two Generative
Adversarial Networks, the Pix2Pix, and the CycleGAN, generate synthetic
recombined images solely from low-energy images. We perform an extensive
quantitative and qualitative analysis of the model's performance, also
exploiting radiologists' assessments, on a novel CESM dataset that includes
1138 images that, as a further contribution of this work, we make publicly
available. The results show that CycleGAN is the most promising deep network to
generate synthetic recombined images, highlighting the potential of artificial
intelligence techniques for virtual contrast enhancement in this field.

<p class="mathjax">The limited availability of labeled chest X-ray datasets is a significant
bottleneck in the development of medical imaging methods. Self-supervised
learning (SSL) can mitigate this problem by training models on unlabeled data.
Furthermore, self-supervised pretraining has yielded promising results in
visual recognition of natural images but has not been given much consideration
in medical image analysis. In this work, we propose a self-supervised method,
DINO-CXR, which is a novel adaptation of a self-supervised method, DINO, based
on a vision transformer for chest X-ray classification. A comparative analysis
is performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for both
pneumonia and COVID-19 detection. Through a quantitative analysis, it is also
shown that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy and achieves comparable results in terms of AUC and F-1 score while
requiring significantly less labeled data.

<p class="mathjax">Hybrid peroskite solar cells are newly emergent high-performance photovoltaic
devices, which suffer from disadvantages such as toxic elements, short-term
stabilities, and so on. Searching for alternative perovskites with high
photovoltaic performances and thermally stabilities is urgent in this field. In
this work, stimulated by the recently proposed materials-genome initiative
project, firstly we build classical machine-learning algorithms for the models
of formation energies, bangdaps and Deybe temperatures for hybrid
organic-inorganic double perovskites, then we choose the high-precision models
to screen a large scale of double-perovskite chemical space, to filter out good
pervoskite candidates for solar cells. We also analyze features of importances
for the the three target properties to reveal the underlying mechanisms and
discover the typical characteristics of high-performances double perovskites.
Secondly we adopt the Crystal graph convolution neural network (CGCNN), to
build precise model for bandgaps of perovskites for further filtering. Finally
we use the ab-initio method to verify the results predicted by the CGCNN
method, and find that, six out of twenty randomly chosen (CH3)2NH2-based HOIDP
candidates possess finite bandgaps, and especially, (CH3)2NH2AuSbCl6 and
(CH3)2NH2CsPdF6 possess the bandgaps of 0.633 eV and 0.504 eV, which are
appropriate for photovoltaic applications. Our work not only provides a large
scale of potential high-performance double-perovskite candidates for futural
experimental or theoretical verification, but also showcases the effective and
powerful prediction of the combined ML and CGCNN method proposed for the first
time here.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an accurate and fast classification network for classification of
brain tumors in MRI images that outperforms all lightweight methods
investigated in terms of accuracy. We test our model on a challenging 2D
T1-weighted CE-MRI dataset containing three types of brain tumors: Meningioma,
Glioma and Pituitary. We introduce an l2-normalized spatial attention mechanism
that acts as a regularizer against overfitting during training. We compare our
results against the state-of-the-art on this dataset and show that by
integrating l2-normalized spatial attention into a baseline network we achieve
a performance gain of 1.79 percentage points. Even better accuracy can be
attained by combining our model in an ensemble with the pretrained VGG16 at the
expense of execution speed. Our code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer in which
the tumor-vascular involvement greatly affects the resectability and, thus,
overall survival of patients. However, current prognostic prediction methods
fail to explicitly and accurately investigate relationships between the tumor
and nearby important vessels. This paper proposes a novel learnable neural
distance that describes the precise relationship between the tumor and vessels
in CT images of different patients, adopting it as a major feature for
prognosis prediction. Besides, different from existing models that used CNNs or
LSTMs to exploit tumor enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT
imaging, we improved the extraction of dynamic tumor-related texture features
in multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT by fusing local and global features using
CNN and transformer modules, further enhancing the features extracted across
multi-phase CT images. We extensively evaluated and compared the proposed
method with existing methods in the multi-center (n=4) dataset with 1,070
patients with PDAC, and statistical analysis confirmed its clinical
effectiveness in the external test set consisting of three centers. The
developed risk marker was the strongest predictor of overall survival among
preoperative factors and it has the potential to be combined with established
clinical factors to select patients at higher risk who might benefit from
neoadjuvant therapy.

<p class="mathjax">Visual attention forms the basis of understanding the visual world. In this
work we follow a computational approach to investigate the biological basis of
visual attention. We analyze retinal and cortical electrophysiological data
from mouse. Visual Stimuli are Natural Images depicting real world scenes. Our
results show that in primary visual cortex (V1), a subset of around $10\%$ of
the neurons responds differently to salient versus non-salient visual regions.
Visual attention information was not traced in retinal response. It appears
that the retina remains naive concerning visual attention; cortical response
gets modulated to interpret visual attention information. Experimental animal
studies may be designed to further explore the biological basis of visual
attention we traced in this study. In applied and translational science, our
study contributes to the design of improved visual prostheses systems --
systems that create artificial visual percepts to visually impaired individuals
by electronic implants placed on either the retina or the cortex.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate the impact of test-time adversarial attacks on
linear regression models and determine the optimal level of robustness that any
model can reach while maintaining a given level of standard predictive
performance (accuracy). Through quantitative estimates, we uncover fundamental
tradeoffs between adversarial robustness and accuracy in different regimes. We
obtain a precise characterization which distinguishes between regimes where
robustness is achievable without hurting standard accuracy and regimes where a
tradeoff might be unavoidable. Our findings are empirically confirmed with
simple experiments that represent a variety of settings. This work applies to
feature covariance matrices and attack norms of any nature, and extends beyond
previous works in this area.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection (AD) involves identifying observations or events that
deviate in some way from the rest of the data. Machine learning techniques have
shown success in automating this process by detecting hidden patterns and
deviations in large-scale data. The potential of quantum computing for machine
learning has been widely recognized, leading to extensive research efforts to
develop suitable quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. In particular, the
search for QML algorithms for near-term NISQ devices is in full swing. However,
NISQ devices pose additional challenges due to their limited qubit coherence
times, low number of qubits, and high error rates. Kernel methods based on
quantum kernel estimation have emerged as a promising approach to QML on NISQ
devices, offering theoretical guarantees, versatility, and compatibility with
NISQ constraints. Especially support vector machines (SVM) utilizing quantum
kernel estimation have shown success in various supervised learning tasks.
However, in the context of AD, semisupervised learning is of great relevance,
and yet there is limited research published in this area. This paper introduces
an approach to semisupervised AD based on the reconstruction loss of a support
vector regression (SVR) with quantum kernel. This novel model is an alternative
to the variational quantum and quantum kernel one-class classifiers, and is
compared to a quantum autoencoder as quantum baseline and a SVR with
radial-basis-function (RBF) kernel as well as a classical autoencoder as
classical baselines. The models are benchmarked extensively on 10 real-world AD
data sets and one toy data set, and it is shown that our SVR model with quantum
kernel performs better than the SVR with RBF kernel as well as all other
models, achieving highest mean AUC over all data sets. In addition, our QSVR
outperforms the quantum autoencoder on 9 out of 11 data sets.

traffic management and passenger flows. In this work, we hope to shed light on
the complex factors that influence transportation mode decisions within
developing countries, using Colombia as a case study. We model an ecosystem of
human agents that decide at each time step on the mode of transportation they
would take to work. Their decision is based on a combination of their personal
satisfaction with the journey they had just taken, which is evaluated across a
personal vector of needs, the information they crowdsource from their
prevailing social network, and their personal uncertainty about the experience
of trying a new transport solution. We simulate different network structures to
analyze the social influence for different decision-makers. We find that in
low/medium connected groups inquisitive people actively change modes cyclically
over the years while imitators cluster rapidly and change less frequently.

effectiveness of medical image processing tasks. Deep learning-based methods
have proven highly advantageous in orientation recognition and prediction
tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of imaging orientation in
cardiac MRI and present a method that employs deep neural networks to
categorize and standardize the orientation. To cater to multiple sequences and
modalities of MRI, we propose a transfer learning strategy, enabling adaptation
of our model from a single modality to diverse modalities. We conducted
comprehensive experiments on CMR images from various modalities, including
bSSFP, T2, and LGE. The validation accuracies achieved were 100.0\%, 100.0\%,
and 99.4\%, confirming the robustness and effectiveness of our model. Our

<p class="mathjax">High-energy physics is facing increasingly computational challenges in
real-time event reconstruction for the near-future high-luminosity era. Using
the LHCb vertex detector as a use-case, we explore a new algorithm for particle
track reconstruction based on the minimisation of an Ising-like Hamiltonian
with a linear algebra approach. The use of a classical matrix inversion
technique results in tracking performance similar to the current
state-of-the-art but with worse scaling complexity in time. To solve this
problem, we also present an implementation as quantum algorithm, using the
Harrow-Hassadim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm: this approach can potentially provide an
exponential speedup as a function of the number of input hits over its
classical counterpart, in spite of limitations due to the well-known HHL
Hamiltonian simulation and readout problems. The findings presented in this
paper shed light on the potential of leveraging quantum computing for real-time
particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics.

<p class="mathjax">Interior point methods are widely used for different types of mathematical
optimization problems. Many implementations of interior point methods in use
today rely on direct linear solvers to solve systems of equations in each
iteration. The need to solve ever larger optimization problems more efficiently
and the rise of hardware accelerators for general purpose computing has led to
a large interest in using iterative linear solvers instead, with the major
issue being inevitable ill-conditioning of the linear systems arising as the
optimization progresses. We investigate the use of Krylov solvers for interior
point methods in solving optimization problems from radiation therapy. We
implement a prototype interior point method using a so called doubly augmented
formulation of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) linear system of equations,
originally proposed by Forsgren and Gill, and evaluate its performance on real
optimization problems from radiation therapy. Crucially, our implementation
uses a preconditioned conjugate gradient method with Jacobi preconditioning
internally. Our measurements of the conditioning of the linear systems indicate
that the Jacobi preconditioner improves the conditioning of the systems to a
degree that they can be solved iteratively, but there is room for further
improvement in that regard. Furthermore, profiling of our prototype code shows
that it is suitable for GPU acceleration, which may further improve its
performance in practice. Overall, our results indicate that our method can find
solutions of acceptable accuracy in reasonable time, even with a simple Jacobi
preconditioner.

<p class="mathjax">Markov categories have recently turned out to be a powerful high-level
framework for probability and statistics. They accomodate purely categorical
definitions of notions like conditional probability and almost sure equality,
as well as proofs of fundamental resutlts such as the Hewitt-Savage 0/1 Law,
the De Finetti Theorem and the Ergodic Decomposition Theorem. In this work, we
develop additional relevant notions from probability theory in the setting of
Markov categories. This comprises improved versions of previously introduced
definitions of absolute continuity and supports, as well as a detailed study of
idempotents and idempotent splitting in Markov categories. Our main result on
idempotent splitting is that every idempotent measurable Markov kernel between
standard Borel spaces splits through another standard Borel space, and we
derive this as an instance of a general categorical criterion for idempotent
splitting in Markov categories.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigated how to build a high-performance vision
encoding model to predict brain activity as part of our participation in the
Algonauts Project 2023 Challenge. The challenge provided brain activity
recorded by functional MRI (fMRI) while participants viewed images. Several
vision models with parameter sizes ranging from 86M to 4.3B were used to build
predictive models. To build highly accurate models, we focused our analysis on
two main aspects: (1) How does the sample size of the fMRI training set change
the prediction accuracy? (2) How does the prediction accuracy across the visual
cortex vary with the parameter size of the vision models? The results show that
as the sample size used during training increases, the prediction accuracy
improves according to the scaling law. Similarly, we found that as the
parameter size of the vision models increases, the prediction accuracy improves
according to the scaling law. These results suggest that increasing the sample
size of the fMRI training set and the parameter size of visual models may
contribute to more accurate visual models of the brain and lead to a better
understanding of visual neuroscience.
