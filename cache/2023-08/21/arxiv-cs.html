<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of consumer health devices such as smart watches, sleep
monitors, smart scales, etc, in many countries, has not only led to growing
interest in health monitoring, but also to the development of a countless
number of ``smart'' applications to support the exploration of such data by
members of the general public, sometimes with integration into professional
health services. While a variety of health data streams has been made available
by such devices to users, these streams are often presented as separate
time-series visualizations, in which the potential relationships between health
variables are not explicitly made visible. Furthermore, despite the fact that
other aspects of life, such as work and social connectivity, have become
increasingly digitised, health and well-being applications make little use of
the potentially useful contextual information provided by widely used personal
information management tools, such as shared calendar and email systems. This
paper presents a framework for the integration of these diverse data sources,
analytic and visualization tools, with inference methods and graphical user
interfaces to help users by highlighting causal connections among such
time-series.

<p class="mathjax">Progress in sensor technologies has made three-dimensional (3D)
representations of the physical world available at a large scale. Leveraging
such 3D representations with analytics has the potential to advance Information
Systems (IS) research in several areas. However, this novel data type has
rarely been incorporated. To address this shortcoming, this article first
presents two showcases of 3D analytics applications together with general
modeling guidelines for 3D analytics, in order to support IS researchers in
implementing research designs with 3D components. Second, the article presents
several promising opportunities for 3D analytics to advance behavioral and
design-oriented IS research in several contextual areas, such as healthcare IS,
human-computer interaction, mobile commerce, energy informatics and others.
Third, we investigate the nature of the benefits resulting from the application
of 3D analytics, resulting in a list of common tasks of research projects that
3D analytics can support, regardless of the contextual application area. Based
on the given showcases, modeling guidelines, research opportunities and
task-related benefits, we encourage IS researchers to start their journey into
this largely unexplored third spatial dimension.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Zero-Shot Node Classification (ZNC) has been an emerging and
crucial task in graph data analysis. This task aims to predict nodes from
unseen classes which are unobserved in the training process. Existing work
mainly utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to associate features' prototypes
and labels' semantics thus enabling knowledge transfer from seen to unseen
classes. However, the multi-faceted semantic orientation in the
feature-semantic alignment has been neglected by previous work, i.e. the
content of a node usually covers diverse topics that are relevant to the
semantics of multiple labels. It's necessary to separate and judge the semantic
factors that tremendously affect the cognitive ability to improve the
generality of models. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted
framework (KMF) that enhances the richness of label semantics via the extracted
KG (Knowledge Graph)-based topics. And then the content of each node is
reconstructed to a topic-level representation that offers multi-faceted and
fine-grained semantic relevancy to different labels. Due to the particularity
of the graph's instance (i.e., node) representation, a novel geometric
constraint is developed to alleviate the problem of prototype drift caused by
node information aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
several public graph datasets and design an application of zero-shot
cross-domain recommendation. The quantitative results demonstrate both the
effectiveness and generalization of KMF with the comparison of state-of-the-art
baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Long-span bridges are subjected to a multitude of dynamic excitations during
their lifespan. To account for their effects on the structural system, several
load models are used during design to simulate the conditions the structure is
likely to experience. These models are based on different simplifying
assumptions and are generally guided by parameters that are stochastically
identified from measurement data, making their outputs inherently uncertain.
This paper presents a probabilistic physics-informed machine-learning framework
based on Gaussian process regression for reconstructing dynamic forces based on
measured deflections, velocities, or accelerations. The model can work with
incomplete and contaminated data and offers a natural regularization approach
to account for noise in the measurement system. An application of the developed
framework is given by an aerodynamic analysis of the Great Belt East Bridge.
The aerodynamic response is calculated numerically based on the quasi-steady
model, and the underlying forces are reconstructed using sparse and noisy
measurements. Results indicate a good agreement between the applied and the
predicted dynamic load and can be extended to calculate global responses and
the resulting internal forces. Uses of the developed framework include
validation of design models and assumptions, as well as prognosis of responses
to assist in damage detection and structural health monitoring.

ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in solving introductory programming tasks. Based on the
performance, implications for didactic scenarios and assessment formats
utilizing LLMs are derived. For the analysis, 72 Python tasks for novice
programmers were selected from the free site CodingBat. Full task descriptions
were used as input to the LLMs, while the generated replies were evaluated
using CodingBat's unit tests. In addition, the general availability of textual
explanations and program code was analyzed. The results show high scores of

<p class="mathjax">Predicting student performance is key in leveraging effective pre-failure
interventions for at-risk students. In this paper, I have analyzed the relative
performance of a suite of 12 nature-inspired algorithms when used to predict
student performance across 3 datasets consisting of instance-based clickstream
data, intra-course single-course performance, and performance when taking
multiple courses simultaneously. I found that, for all datasets, leveraging an
ensemble approach using NIAs for feature selection and traditional ML
algorithms for classification increased predictive accuracy while also reducing
feature set size by 2/3.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) models are prevalent today and provide a
valuable tool for artists. However, a lesser-known artifact that comes with AI
models that is not always discussed is the glitch. Glitches occur for various
reasons; sometimes, they are known, and sometimes they are a mystery. Artists
who use AI models to generate art might not understand the reason for the
glitch but often want to experiment and explore novel ways of augmenting the
output of the glitch. This paper discusses some of the questions artists have
when leveraging the glitch in AI art production. It explores the unexpected
positive outcomes produced by glitches in the specific context of motion
capture and performance art.

<p class="mathjax">Affect is an emotional characteristic encompassing valence, arousal, and
intensity, and is a crucial attribute for enabling authentic conversations.
While existing text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-speech systems rely on
strength embedding vectors and global style tokens to capture emotions, these
models represent emotions as a component of style or represent them in discrete
categories. We propose AffectEcho, an emotion translation model, that uses a
Vector Quantized codebook to model emotions within a quantized space featuring
five levels of affect intensity to capture complex nuances and subtle
differences in the same emotion. The quantized emotional embeddings are
implicitly derived from spoken speech samples, eliminating the need for one-hot
vectors or explicit strength embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in controlling the emotions of generated speech
while preserving identity, style, and emotional cadence unique to each speaker.
We showcase the language-independent emotion modeling capability of the
quantized emotional embeddings learned from a bilingual (English and Chinese)
speech corpus with an emotion transfer task from a reference speech to a target
speech. We achieve state-of-art results on both qualitative and quantitative
metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Whenever humans use tools human performance is enhanced. Cognitive systems
are a new kind of tool continually increasing in cognitive capability and are
now performing high level cognitive tasks previously thought to be explicitly
human. Usage of such tools, known as cogs, are expected to result in ever
increasing levels of human cognitive augmentation. In a human cog ensemble, a
cooperative, peer to peer, and collaborative dialog between a human and a
cognitive system, human cognitive capability is augmented as a result of the
interaction. The human cog ensemble is therefore able to achieve more than just
the human or the cog working alone. This article presents results from two
studies designed to measure the effect information supplied by a cog has on
cognitive accuracy, the ability to produce the correct result, and cognitive
precision, the propensity to produce only the correct result. Both cognitive
accuracy and cognitive precision are shown to be increased by information of
different types (policies and rules, examples, and suggestions) and with
different kinds of problems (inventive problem solving and puzzles). Similar
effects shown in other studies are compared.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid growth of technology and computer science, which has led to a surge
in demand for skilled professionals in this field. The skill set required for
computer science jobs has evolved rapidly, creating challenges for those
already in the workforce who need to adapt their skills quickly to meet
industry demands. To stay ahead of the curve, it is essential to understand the
hottest skills needed in the field. The article introduces a new method for
analyzing job advertisements using social network analysis to identify the most
critical skills required by employers in the market. In this research, to form
the communication network of skills, first 5763 skills were collected from the
LinkedIn social network, then the relationship between skills was collected and
searched in 7777 computer science job advertisements, and finally, the balanced
communication network of skills was formed. The study analyzes the formed
communication network of skills in the computer science job market and
identifies four distinct communities of skills: Generalists, Infrastructure and
Security, Software Development, and Embedded Systems. The findings reveal that
employers value both hard and soft skills, such as programming languages and
teamwork. Communication skills were found to be the most important skill in the
labor market. Additionally, certain skills were highlighted based on their
centrality indices, including communication, English, SQL, Git, and business
skills, among others. The study provides valuable insights into the current
state of the computer science job market and can help guide individuals and
organizations in making informed decisions about skills acquisition and hiring
practices.

<p class="mathjax">With recent empirical observations, it has been argued that the most
significant aspect of developing accurate language models may be the proper
dataset content and training strategy compared to the number of neural
parameters, training duration or dataset size. Following this argument, we
opted to fine tune a one billion parameter size trained general purpose causal
language model with a dataset curated on team statistics of the Italian
football league first ten game weeks, using low rank adaptation. The limited
training dataset was compiled based on a framework where a powerful commercial

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in large-scale models, such as GPT-4, have showcased
remarkable capabilities in addressing standard queries. However, when facing
complex problems that require multi-step logical reasoning, their accuracy
dramatically decreases. Current research has explored the realm of
\textit{prompting engineering} to bolster the inferential capacities of these
models. Our paper unveils a pioneering prompting technique, dubbed
\textit{Graph of Thoughts (GoT)}. Through testing on a trio of escalating
challenges: the 24-point game, resolution of high-degree polynomial equations,
and derivation of formulas for recursive sequences, our method outperformed
GPT-4, achieving accuracy improvements of $89.7\%$, $86\%$, and $56\%$ for each
respective task. Moreover, when juxtaposed with the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
prompting method, \textit{Tree of Thought (ToT)}, our approach registered an
average accuracy boost of $23\%$, $24\%$, and $15\%$.

<p class="mathjax">With the proliferation of social media, a growing number of users search for
and join group activities in their daily life. This develops a need for the
study on the group identification (GI) task, i.e., recommending groups to
users. The major challenge in this task is how to predict users' preferences
for groups based on not only previous group participation of users but also
users' interests in items. Although recent developments in Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) accomplish embedding multiple types of objects in graph-based
recommender systems, they, however, fail to address this GI problem
comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Group
Identification via Transitional Hypergraph Convolution with Graph
Self-supervised Learning (GTGS). We devise a novel transitional hypergraph
convolution layer to leverage users' preferences for items as prior knowledge
when seeking their group preferences. To construct comprehensive user/group
representations for GI task, we design the cross-view self-supervised learning
to encourage the intrinsic consistency between item and group preferences for
each user, and the group-based regularization to enhance the distinction among
group embeddings. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the
superiority of GTGS. Additional detailed investigations are conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

continuing data collection efforts. The monthly Earth gravity field, derived

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to train a model capable of predicting
accelerometer data for all three axes.
<br />In this study, we describe the methodology used to preprocess the
accelerometer data, prepare it for LSTM training, and evaluate the model's
performance. Through experimentation and validation, we assess the model's
accuracy and its ability to predict accelerometer data for the three axes. Our

<p class="mathjax">Using language models (LMs) pre-trained in a self-supervised setting on large
corpora and then fine-tuning for a downstream task has helped to deal with the
problem of limited label data for supervised learning tasks such as Named
Entity Recognition (NER). Recent research in biomedical language processing has
offered a number of biomedical LMs pre-trained using different methods and
techniques that advance results on many BioNLP tasks, including NER. However,
there is still a lack of a comprehensive comparison of pre-training approaches
that would work more optimally in the biomedical domain. This paper aims to
investigate different pre-training methods, such as pre-training the biomedical
LM from scratch and pre-training it in a continued fashion. We compare existing
methods with our proposed pre-training method of initializing weights for new
tokens by distilling existing weights from the BERT model inside the context
where the tokens were found. The method helps to speed up the pre-training
stage and improve performance on NER. In addition, we compare how masking rate,
corruption strategy, and masking strategies impact the performance of the
biomedical LM. Finally, using the insights from our experiments, we introduce a
new biomedical LM (BIOptimus), which is pre-trained using Curriculum Learning
(CL) and contextualized weight distillation method. Our model sets new states
of the art on several biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We
release our code and all pre-trained models

<p class="mathjax">Interpreting a seemingly-simple function word like "or", "behind", or "more"
can require logical, numerical, and relational reasoning. How are such words
learned by children? Prior acquisition theories have often relied on positing a
foundation of innate knowledge. Yet recent neural-network based visual question
answering models apparently can learn to use function words as part of
answering questions about complex visual scenes. In this paper, we study what
these models learn about function words, in the hope of better understanding
how the meanings of these words can be learnt by both models and children. We
show that recurrent models trained on visually grounded language learn gradient
semantics for function words requiring spacial and numerical reasoning.
Furthermore, we find that these models can learn the meanings of logical
connectives "and" and "or" without any prior knowledge of logical reasoning, as
well as early evidence that they can develop the ability to reason about
alternative expressions when interpreting language. Finally, we show that word
learning difficulty is dependent on frequency in models' input. Our findings
offer evidence that it is possible to learn the meanings of function words in
visually grounded context by using non-symbolic general statistical learning
algorithms, without any prior knowledge of linguistic meaning.

<p class="mathjax">Diamond Light Source produces synchrotron radiation by accelerating electrons
to relativistic speeds. In order to maximise the intensity of the radiation,
vibrations of the electron beam are attenuated by a multi-input multi-output
(MIMO) control system actuating hundreds of magnets at kilohertz rates. For
future accelerator configurations, in which two separate arrays of magnets with
different bandwidths are used in combination, standard accelerator control
design methods based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the system
gain matrix are not suitable. We therefore propose to use the generalised
singular value decomposition (GSVD) to decouple a two-array cross-directional
(CD) system into sets of two-input single-output (TISO) and single-input
single-output (SISO) systems. We demonstrate that the two-array decomposition
is linked to a single-array system, which is used to accommodate
ill-conditioned systems and compensate for the non-orthogonality of the GSVD.
The GSVD-based design is implemented and validated through real-world
experiments at Diamond. Our approach provides a natural extension of
single-array methods and has potential application in other CD systems,
including paper making, steel rolling or battery manufacturing processes.

<p class="mathjax">Repetitive counting (RepCount) is critical in various applications, such as
fitness tracking and rehabilitation. Previous methods have relied on the
estimation of red-green-and-blue (RGB) frames and body pose landmarks to
identify the number of action repetitions, but these methods suffer from a
number of issues, including the inability to stably handle changes in camera
viewpoints, over-counting, under-counting, difficulty in distinguishing between
sub-actions, inaccuracy in recognizing salient poses, etc. In this paper, based
on the work done by [1], we integrate joint angles with body pose landmarks to
address these challenges and achieve better results than the state-of-the-art
RepCount methods, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.211 and an Off-By-One
(OBO) counting accuracy of 0.599 on the RepCount data set [2]. Comprehensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
method.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm, in
which multiple clients collaboratively train ML models without centralizing
their local data. Similar to conventional ML pipelines, the client local
optimization and server aggregation procedure in FL are sensitive to the
hyperparameter (HP) selection. Despite extensive research on tuning HPs for
centralized ML, these methods yield suboptimal results when employed in FL.
This is mainly because their "training-after-tuning" framework is unsuitable
for FL with limited client computation power. While some approaches have been
proposed for HP-Tuning in FL, they are limited to the HPs for client local
updates. In this work, we propose a novel HP-tuning algorithm, called Federated
Population-based Hyperparameter Tuning (FedPop), to address this vital yet
challenging problem. FedPop employs population-based evolutionary algorithms to
optimize the HPs, which accommodates various HP types at both client and server
sides. Compared with prior tuning methods, FedPop employs an online
"tuning-while-training" framework, offering computational efficiency and
enabling the exploration of a broader HP search space. Our empirical validation
on the common FL benchmarks and complex real-world FL datasets demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms the
concurrent state-of-the-art HP tuning methods for FL.

<p class="mathjax">Deep generative models require large amounts of training data. This often
poses a problem as the collection of datasets can be expensive and difficult,
in particular datasets that are representative of the appropriate underlying
distribution (e.g. demographic). This introduces biases in datasets which are
further propagated in the models. We present an approach to mitigate biases in
an existing generative adversarial network by rebalancing the model
distribution. We do so by generating balanced data from an existing unbalanced
deep generative model using latent space exploration and using this data to
train a balanced generative model. Further, we propose a bias mitigation loss
function that shows improvements in the fairness metric even when trained with
unbalanced datasets. We show results for the Stylegan2 models while training on
the FFHQ dataset for racial fairness and see that the proposed approach
improves on the fairness metric by almost 5 times, whilst maintaining image
quality. We further validate our approach by applying it to an imbalanced
Cifar-10 dataset. Lastly, we argue that the traditionally used image quality
metrics such as Frechet inception distance (FID) are unsuitable for bias
mitigation problems.

<p class="mathjax">Definite descriptions, such as 'the smallest planet in the Solar System',
have been recently recognised as semantically transparent devices for object
identification in knowledge representation formalisms. Along with individual
names, they have been introduced also in the context of description logic
languages, enriching the expressivity of standard nominal constructors.
Moreover, in the first-order modal logic literature, definite descriptions have
been widely investigated for their non-rigid behaviour, which allows them to
denote different objects at different states. In this direction, we introduce
epistemic and temporal extensions of standard description logics, with nominals
and the universal role, additionally equipped with definite descriptions
constructors. Regarding names and descriptions, in these languages we allow
for: possible lack of denotation, ensured by partial models, coming from free
logic semantics as a generalisation of the classical ones; and non-rigid
designation features, obtained by assigning to terms distinct values across
states, as opposed to the standard rigidity condition on individual
expressions. In the absence of the rigid designator assumption, we show that
the satisfiability problem for epistemic free description logics is
NExpTime-complete, while satisfiability for temporal free description logics
over linear time structures is undecidable.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study a fundamental problem in submodular optimization,
which is called sequential submodular maximization. Specifically, we aim to
select and rank a group of $k$ items from a ground set $V$ such that the
weighted summation of $k$ (possibly non-monotone) submodular functions $f_1,
\cdots ,f_k: 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is maximized, here each function
$f_j$ takes the first $j$ items from this sequence as input. The existing
research on sequential submodular maximization has predominantly concentrated
on the monotone setting, assuming that the submodular functions are
non-decreasing. However, in various real-world scenarios, like diversity-aware
recommendation systems, adding items to an existing set might negatively impact
the overall utility. In response, this paper pioneers the examination of the
aforementioned problem with non-monotone submodular functions and offers
effective solutions for both flexible and fixed length constraints, as well as
a special case with identical utility functions. The empirical evaluations

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on addressing the practical yet challenging problem of
model heterogeneity in federated learning, where clients possess models with
different network structures. To track this problem, we propose a novel
framework called pFedHR, which leverages heterogeneous model reassembly to
achieve personalized federated learning. In particular, we approach the problem
of heterogeneous model personalization as a model-matching optimization task on
the server side. Moreover, pFedHR automatically and dynamically generates
informative and diverse personalized candidates with minimal human
intervention. Furthermore, our proposed heterogeneous model reassembly
technique mitigates the adverse impact introduced by using public data with
different distributions from the client data to a certain extent. Experimental
results demonstrate that pFedHR outperforms baselines on three datasets under
both IID and Non-IID settings. Additionally, pFedHR effectively reduces the
adverse impact of using different public data and dynamically generates diverse
personalized models in an automated manner.

<p class="mathjax">Biologically-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), processing information
using discrete-time events known as spikes rather than continuous values, have
garnered significant attention due to their hardware-friendly and
energy-efficient characteristics. However, the training of SNNs necessitates a
considerably large memory footprint, given the additional storage requirements
for spikes or events, leading to a complex structure and dynamic setup. In this
paper, to address memory constraint in SNN training, we introduce an innovative
framework, characterized by a remarkably low memory footprint. We \textbf{(i)}
design a reversible SNN node that retains a high level of accuracy. Our design
is able to achieve a $\mathbf{58.65\times}$ reduction in memory usage compared
to the current SNN node. We \textbf{(ii)} propose a unique algorithm to
streamline the backpropagation process of our reversible SNN node. This
significantly trims the backward Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPs),
thereby accelerating the training process in comparison to current reversible
layer backpropagation method. By using our algorithm, the training time is able
to be curtailed by $\mathbf{23.8\%}$ relative to existing reversible layer
architectures.

reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
networks. The limited battery life of UAVs is a major concern for their
sustainable operation, and RIS has emerged as a promising solution to reducing
the energy consumption of communication systems. The paper formulates the
problem of maximizing the energy efficiency of the network as a mixed integer
non-linear program, in which UAV placement, UAV beamforming, On-Off strategy of
RIS elements, and phase shift of RIS elements are optimized. The proposed
solution utilizes the block coordinate descent approach and a combination of
continuous and binary genetic algorithms. Moreover, for optimizing the UAV
placement, Adam optimizer is used. The simulation results show that the
proposed solution outperforms the existing literature. Specifically, we
compared the proposed method with the successive convex approximation (SCA)
approach for optimizing the phase shift of RIS elements.

picture of the items, materials, and chemicals in a scene but analysis can be
difficult, slow, and expensive due to high spatial and spectral resolutions of
state-of-the-art sensors. As such, sparsity is important to enable the future
of spectral compression and analytics. It has been observed that environmental
and atmospheric effects, including scattering, can produce nonlinear effects
posing challenges for existing source separation and compression methods. We
present a novel transformation into Hilbert spaces for pruning and constructing
sparse representations via non-negative least squares minimization. Then we
introduce max likelihood compression vectors to decrease information loss. Our
approach is benchmarked against standard pruning and least squares as well as
deep learning methods. Our methods are evaluated in terms of overall spectral
reconstruction error and compression rate using real and synthetic data. We
find that pruning least squares methods converge quickly unlike matching
pursuit methods. We find that Hilbert space pruning can reduce error by as much
as 40% of the error of standard pruning and also outperform neural network
autoencoders.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic response evaluation in structural engineering is the process of
determining the response of a structure, such as member forces, node
displacements, etc when subjected to dynamic loads such as earthquakes, wind,
or impact. This is an important aspect of structural analysis, as it enables
engineers to assess structural performance under extreme loading conditions and
make informed decisions about the design and safety of the structure.
Conventional methods for dynamic response evaluation involve numerical
simulations using finite element analysis (FEA), where the structure is modeled
using finite elements, and the equations of motion are solved numerically.
Although effective, this approach can be computationally intensive and may not
be suitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, recent
advancements in machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks, have
been applied to dynamic response evaluation in structural engineering. These
techniques leverage large data sets and sophisticated algorithms to learn the
complex relationship between inputs and outputs, making them ideal for such
problems. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for evaluating the
dynamic response of multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems using
physics-informed recurrent neural networks. The focus of this paper is to
evaluate the seismic (earthquake) response of nonlinear structures. The
predicted response will be compared to state-of-the-art methods such as FEA to
assess the efficacy of the physics-informed RNN model.

the limitations of standard Internet data collection methods in low- and

Africa. We report the quantity and content of available data with comparisons

according to fine-grained intra-national wealth estimates. Temporal analyses
are performed at two-year intervals to expose emerging data trends.
Furthermore, we present findings for an ``othering'' phenomenon as evidenced by
a substantial number of images from Africa being taken by non-local
photographers. The results of our study suggest that further work is required
to capture image data representative of African people and their environments
and, ultimately, to improve the applicability of computer vision models in a

<p class="mathjax">Human Facial Expressions plays an important role in identifying human actions
or intention. Facial expressions can represent any specific action of any
person and the pattern of violent behavior of any person strongly depends on
the geographic region. Here we have designed an automated system by using a
Convolutional Neural Network which can detect whether a person has any
intention to commit any crime or not. Here we proposed a new method that can
identify criminal intentions or violent behavior of any person before executing
crimes more efficiently by using very little data on facial expressions before
executing a crime or any violent tasks. Instead of using image features which
is a time-consuming and faulty method we used an automated feature selector
Convolutional Neural Network model which can capture exact facial expressions
for training and then can predict that target facial expressions more
accurately. Here we used only the facial data of a specific geographic region
which can represent the violent and before-crime before-crime facial patterns
of the people of the whole region.

<p class="mathjax">Researchers constantly strive to explore larger and more complex search
spaces in various scientific studies and physical experiments. However, such
investigations often involve sophisticated simulators or time-consuming
experiments that make exploring and observing new design samples challenging.
Previous works that target such applications are typically sample-inefficient
and restricted to vector search spaces. To address these limitations, this work
proposes a constrained multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework, called
BREATHE, that searches not only traditional vector-based design spaces but also
graph-based design spaces to obtain best-performing graphs. It leverages
second-order gradients and actively trains a heteroscedastic surrogate model
for sample-efficient optimization. In a single-objective vector optimization
application, it leads to 64.1% higher performance than the next-best baseline,
random forest regression. In graph-based search, BREATHE outperforms the
next-best baseline, i.e., a graphical version of Gaussian-process-based
Bayesian optimization, with up to 64.9% higher performance. In a MOO task, it
achieves up to 21.9$\times$ higher hypervolume than the state-of-the-art
method, multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBOpt). BREATHE also
outperforms the baseline methods on most standard MOO benchmark applications.

<p class="mathjax">Software ecosystems (e.g., npm, PyPI) are the backbone of modern software
developments. Developers add new packages to ecosystems every day to solve new
problems or provide alternative solutions, causing obsolete packages to decline
in their importance to the community. Packages in decline are reused less
overtime and may become less frequently maintained. Thus, developers usually
migrate their dependencies to better alternatives. Replacing packages in
decline with better alternatives requires time and effort by developers to
identify packages that need to be replaced, find the alternatives, asset
migration benefits, and finally, perform the migration.
<br />This paper proposes an approach that automatically identifies packages that
need to be replaced and finds their alternatives supported with real-world
examples of open source projects performing the suggested migrations. At its
core, our approach relies on the dependency migration patterns performed in the
ecosystem to suggest migrations to other developers. We evaluated our approach
on the npm ecosystem and found that 96% of the suggested alternatives are
accurate. Furthermore, by surveying expert JavaScript developers, 67% of them
indicate that they will use our suggested alternative packages in their future
projects.

<p class="mathjax">Skin cancer is a treatable disease if discovered early. We provide a
production-specific solution to the skin cancer classification problem that
matches human performance in melanoma identification by training a vision
transformer on melanoma medical images annotated by experts. Since inference
cost, both time and memory wise is important in practice, we employ knowledge
distillation to obtain a model that retains 98.33% of the teacher's balanced
multi-class accuracy, at a fraction of the cost. Memory-wise, our model is
49.60% smaller than the teacher. Time-wise, our solution is 69.25% faster on
GPU and 97.96% faster on CPU. By adding classification heads at each level of
the transformer and employing a cascading distillation process, we improve the
balanced multi-class accuracy of the base model by 2.1%, while creating a range
of models of various sizes but comparable performance. We provide the code at

<p class="mathjax">Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC) is the problem of finding a simple cycle of
minimum weight in a graph $G=(V,E)$. This is a fundamental graph problem with
classical sequential algorithms that run in $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ and
$\tilde{O}(mn)$ time where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$. In recent years this problem
has received significant attention in the context of hardness through fine
grained sequential complexity as well as in design of faster sequential
approximation algorithms.
<br />For computing minimum weight cycle in the distributed CONGEST model,
near-linear in $n$ lower and upper bounds on round complexity are known for
directed graphs (weighted and unweighted), and for undirected weighted graphs;
these lower bounds also apply to any $(2-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
This paper focuses on round complexity bounds for approximating MWC in the
CONGEST model: For coarse approximations we show that for any constant $\alpha
&gt;1$, computing an $\alpha$-approximation of MWC requires $\Omega (\frac{\sqrt
n}{\log n})$ rounds on weighted undirected graphs and on directed graphs, even
if unweighted. We complement these lower bounds with sublinear
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3}+D)$-round algorithms for approximating MWC close to a factor
of 2 in these classes of graphs.
<br />A key ingredient of our approximation algorithms is an efficient algorithm
for computing $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths from $k$ sources in
directed and weighted graphs, which may be of independent interest for other
CONGEST problems. We present an algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nk} +
D)$ rounds if $k \ge n^{1/3}$ and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nk} +
k^{2/5}n^{2/5+o(1)}D^{2/5} + D)$ rounds if $k&lt;n^{1/3}$, and this round
complexity smoothly interpolates between the best known upper bounds for
approximate (or exact) SSSP when $k=1$ and APSP when $k=n$.

<p class="mathjax">The min-diameter of a directed graph $G$ is a measure of the largest distance
between nodes. It is equal to the maximum min-distance $d_{min}(u,v)$ across
all pairs $u,v \in V(G)$, where $d_{min}(u,v) = \min(d(u,v), d(v,u))$. Our work
provides a $O(m^{1.426}n^{0.288})$-time $3/2$-approximation algorithm for
min-diameter in DAGs, and a faster $O(m^{0.713}n)$-time
almost-$3/2$-approximation variant. (An almost-$\alpha$-approximation algorithm
determines the min-diameter to within a multiplicative factor of $\alpha$ plus
constant additive error.) By a conditional lower bound result of [Abboud et al,
SODA 2016], a better than $3/2$-approximation can't be achieved in truly
subquadratic time under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), so our
result is conditionally tight. We additionally obtain a new conditional lower
bound for min-diameter approximation in general directed graphs, showing that
under SETH, one cannot achieve an approximation factor below 2 in truly
subquadratic time. We also present the first study of approximating bichromatic
min-diameter, which is the maximum min-distance between oppositely colored
vertices in a 2-colored graph.

<p class="mathjax">In the rapidly evolving domain of machine learning, ensuring model
generalizability remains a quintessential challenge. Overfitting, where a model
exhibits superior performance on training data but falters on unseen data, is a
recurrent concern. This paper introduces the Overfitting Index (OI), a novel
metric devised to quantitatively assess a model's tendency to overfit. Through
extensive experiments on the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUS) and the
MNIST dataset using architectures such as MobileNet, U-Net, ResNet, Darknet,
and ViT-32, we illustrate the utility and discernment of the OI. Our results
underscore the variable overfitting behaviors across architectures and
highlight the mitigative impact of data augmentation, especially on smaller and
more specialized datasets. The ViT-32's performance on MNIST further emphasizes
the robustness of certain models and the dataset's comprehensive nature. By
providing an objective lens to gauge overfitting, the OI offers a promising
avenue to advance model optimization and ensure real-world efficacy.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional neural word embeddings are usually dependent on a richer
diversity of vocabulary. However, the language models recline to cover major
vocabularies via the word embedding parameters, in particular, for multilingual
language models that generally cover a significant part of their overall
learning parameters. In this work, we present a new compact embedding structure
to reduce the memory footprint of the pre-trained language models with a
sacrifice of up to 4% absolute accuracy. The embeddings vectors reconstruction
follows a set of subspace embeddings and an assignment procedure via the
contextual relationship among tokens from pre-trained language models. The
subspace embedding structure calibrates to masked language models, to evaluate
our compact embedding structure on similarity and textual entailment tasks,
sentence and paraphrase tasks. Our experimental evaluation shows that the
subspace embeddings achieve compression rates beyond 99.8% in comparison with
the original embeddings for the language models on XNLI and GLUE benchmark
suites.

<p class="mathjax">The Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem is the problem of augmenting
the edge-connectivity of a given graph by adding links of minimum total cost.
This work focuses on connectivity augmentation problems in the Steiner setting,
where we are not interested in the connectivity between all nodes of the graph,
but only the connectivity between a specified subset of terminals.
<br />We consider two related settings. In the Steiner Augmentation of a Graph
problem ($k$-SAG), we are given a $k$-edge-connected subgraph $H$ of a graph
$G$. The goal is to augment $H$ by including links and nodes from $G$ of
minimum cost so that the edge-connectivity between nodes of $H$ increases by 1.
In the Steiner Connectivity Augmentation Problem ($k$-SCAP), we are given a
Steiner $k$-edge-connected graph connecting terminals $R$, and we seek to add
links of minimum cost to create a Steiner $(k+1)$-edge-connected graph for $R$.
Note that $k$-SAG is a special case of $k$-SCAP.
<br />All of the above problems can be approximated to within a factor of 2 using
e.g. Jain's iterative rounding algorithm for Survivable Network Design. In this
work, we leverage the framework of Traub and Zenklusen to give a $(1 + \ln{2}
+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the Steiner Ring Augmentation Problem (SRAP):
given a cycle $H = (V(H),E)$ embedded in a larger graph $G = (V, E \cup L)$ and
a subset of terminals $R \subseteq V(H)$, choose a subset of links $S \subseteq
L$ of minimum cost so that $(V, E \cup S)$ has 3 pairwise edge-disjoint paths
between every pair of terminals.
<br />We show this yields a polynomial time algorithm with approximation ratio $(1
+ \ln{2} + \varepsilon)$ for $2$-SCAP. We obtain an improved approximation
guarantee of $(1.5+\varepsilon)$ for SRAP in the case that $R = V(H)$, which
yields a $(1.5+\varepsilon)$-approximation for $k$-SAG for any $k$.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the development of communication technology and the rise of user
network demand, a reasonable resource allocation for wireless networks is the
key to guaranteeing regular operation and improving system performance. Various
frequency bands exist in the natural network environment, and heterogeneous
cellular network (HCN) has become a hot topic for current research. Meanwhile,
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has become a key technology for
developing next-generation wireless networks. By modifying the phase of the
incident signal arriving at the RIS surface, RIS can improve the signal quality
at the receiver and reduce co-channel interference. In this paper, we develop a
RIS-assisted HCN model for a multi-base station (BS) multi-frequency network,
which includes 4G, 5G, millimeter wave (mmwave), and terahertz networks, and
considers the case of multiple network coverage users, which is more in line
with the realistic network characteristics and the concept of 6G networks. We
propose the optimization objective of maximizing the system sum rate, which is
decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., the user resource allocation and the
phase shift optimization problem of RIS components. Due to the NP-hard and
coupling relationship, we use the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to
alternately optimize the local solutions of the coalition game and the local
discrete phase search algorithm to obtain the global solution. In contrast,
most previous studies have used the coalition game algorithm to solve the
resource allocation problem alone. Simulation results show that the algorithm
performs better than the rest of the algorithms, effectively improves the
system sum rate, and achieves performance close to the optimal solution of the
traversal algorithm with low complexity.

plan in an abstract search space of its own creation that is completely
decoupled from the real environment. Unlike prior approaches, this enables the
agent to perform high-level planning at arbitrary timescales and reason in
terms of compound or temporally-extended actions, which can be useful in
environments where large numbers of base-level micro-actions are needed to
perform relevant macro-actions. In addition, our method is more general than
comparable prior methods because it handles settings with continuous action

comparable prior methods without assuming access to an environment simulator.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying anomalous objects
within images, which facilitates the detection of road anomalies for autonomous
driving. Although existing methods have shown impressive results in anomaly
segmentation using synthetic training data, the domain discrepancies between
synthetic training data and real test data are often neglected. To address this
issue, the Multi-Granularity Cross-Domain Alignment (MGCDA) framework is
proposed for anomaly segmentation in complex driving environments. It uniquely
combines a new Multi-source Domain Adversarial Training (MDAT) module and a
novel Cross-domain Anomaly-aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) method to boost
the generality of the model, seamlessly integrating multi-domain data at both
scene and sample levels. Multi-source domain adversarial loss and a dynamic
label smoothing strategy are integrated into the MDAT module to facilitate the
acquisition of domain-invariant features at the scene level, through
adversarial training across multiple stages. CACL aligns sample-level
representations with contrastive loss on cross-domain data, which utilizes an
anomaly-aware sampling strategy to efficiently sample hard samples and anchors.
The proposed framework has decent properties of parameter-free during the
inference stage and is compatible with other anomaly segmentation networks.
Experimental conducted on Fishyscapes and RoadAnomaly datasets demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">Handwriting is an art form that most people learn at an early age. Each
person's writing style is unique with small changes as we grow older and as our
mood changes. Here we analyse handwritten text in a culturally significant
personal diary. We compare changes in handwriting and relate this to the
sentiment of the written material and to the topic of diary entries. We
identify handwritten text from digitised images and generate a canonical form
for words using shape matching to compare how the same handwritten word appears
over a period of time. For determining the sentiment of diary entries, we use
the Hedonometer, a dictionary-based approach to scoring sentiment. We apply
these techniques to the historical diary entries of Rosamond Jacob (1888-1960),
an Irish writer and political activist whose daily diary entries report on the
major events in Ireland during the first half of the last century.

<p class="mathjax">Recursive queries and recursive derived tables constitute an important part
of the SQL standard. Their efficient processing is important for many real-life
applications that rely on graph or hierarchy traversal. Position-enabled
column-stores offer a novel opportunity to improve run times for this type of
queries. Such systems allow the engine to explicitly use data positions (row
ids) inside its core and thus, enable novel efficient implementations of query
plan operators.
<br />In this paper, we present an approach that significantly speeds up recursive
query processing inside RDBMSes. Its core idea is to employ a particular aspect
of column-store technology (late materialization) which enables the query
engine to manipulate data positions during query execution. Based on it, we
propose two sets of Volcano-style operators intended to process different query
cases.
<br />In order validate our ideas, we have implemented the proposed approach in
PosDB, an RDBMS column-store with SQL support. We experimentally demonstrate
the viability of our approach by providing a comparison with PostgreSQL.
Experiments show that for breadth-first search: 1) our position-based approach
yields up to 6x better results than PostgreSQL, 2) our tuple-based one results
in only 3x improvement when using a special rewriting technique, but it can
work in a larger number of cases, and 3) both approaches can't be emulated in
row-stores efficiently.

<p class="mathjax">We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the general
framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the
known hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we
advocate leveraging the potential \emph{information-sharing} among agents, a
common practice in empirical MARL, and a standard model for multi-agent control
systems with communications. We first establish several computation complexity
results to justify the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the
observability assumption that has enabled quasi-efficient single-agent RL with
partial observations, for computational efficiency in solving POSGs. We then
propose to further \emph{approximate} the shared common information to
construct an {approximate model} of the POSG, in which planning an approximate
equilibrium (in terms of solving the original POSG) can be quasi-efficient,
i.e., of quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions.
Furthermore, we develop a partially observable MARL algorithm that is both
statistically and computationally quasi-efficient. We hope our study may open
up the possibilities of leveraging and even designing different
\emph{information structures}, for developing both sample- and
computation-efficient partially observable MARL.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic, the shortage of radio spectrum
resource has become increasingly prominent. Millimeter wave (mmWave) small
cells can be densely deployed in macro cells to improve network capacity and
spectrum utilization. Such a network architecture is referred to as mmWave
heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). Compared with the traditional wired
backhaul, The integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architecture with wireless
backhaul is more flexible and cost-effective for mmWave HetNets. However, the
imbalance of throughput between the access and backhaul links will constrain
the total system throughput. Consequently, it is necessary to jointly design of
radio access and backhaul link. In this paper, we study the joint optimization
of user association and backhaul resource allocation in mmWave HetNets, where
different mmWave bands are adopted by the access and backhaul links.
Considering the non-convex and combinatorial characteristics of the
optimization problem and the dynamic nature of the mmWave link, we propose a
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based scheme to maximize the
long-term total link throughput of the network. The simulation results show
that the scheme can not only adjust user association and backhaul resource
allocation strategy according to the dynamics in the access link state, but
also effectively improve the link throughput under different system
configurations.

<p class="mathjax">Whether current or near-term AI systems could be conscious is a topic of
scientific interest and increasing public concern. This report argues for, and
exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically grounded approach to AI consciousness:
assessing existing AI systems in detail, in light of our best-supported
neuroscientific theories of consciousness. We survey several prominent
scientific theories of consciousness, including recurrent processing theory,
global workspace theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and
attention schema theory. From these theories we derive "indicator properties"
of consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to assess AI
systems for these properties. We use these indicator properties to assess
several recent AI systems, and we discuss how future systems might implement
them. Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also
shows that there are no obvious barriers to building conscious AI systems.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been used to solve different day-to-day
problems. Recently, DNNs have been deployed in real-time systems, and lowering
the energy consumption and response time has become the need of the hour. To
address this scenario, researchers have proposed incorporating dynamic
mechanism to static DNNs (SDNN) to create Dynamic Neural Networks (DyNNs)
performing dynamic amounts of computation based on the input complexity.
Although incorporating dynamic mechanism into SDNNs would be preferable in
real-time systems, it also becomes important to evaluate how the introduction
of dynamic mechanism impacts the robustness of the models. However, there has
not been a significant number of works focusing on the robustness trade-off
between SDNNs and DyNNs. To address this issue, we propose to investigate the
robustness of dynamic mechanism in DyNNs and how dynamic mechanism design
impacts the robustness of DyNNs. For that purpose, we evaluate three research
questions. These evaluations are performed on three models and two datasets.
Through the studies, we find that attack transferability from DyNNs to SDNNs is
higher than attack transferability from SDNNs to DyNNs. Also, we find that
DyNNs can be used to generate adversarial samples more efficiently than SDNNs.
Then, through research studies, we provide insight into the design choices that
can increase robustness of DyNNs against the attack generated using static
model. Finally, we propose a novel attack to understand the additional attack
surface introduced by the dynamic mechanism and provide design choices to
improve robustness against the attack.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past few decades, ubiquitous sensors and systems have been an
integral part of humans' everyday life. They augment human capabilities and
provide personalized experiences across diverse contexts such as healthcare,
education, and transportation. However, the widespread adoption of ubiquitous
computing has also brought forth concerns regarding fairness and equitable
treatment. As these systems can make automated decisions that impact
individuals, it is essential to ensure that they do not perpetuate biases or
discriminate against specific groups. While fairness in ubiquitous computing
has been an acknowledged concern since the 1990s, it remains understudied
within the field. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that incorporates
fairness considerations into system design, including prioritizing stakeholder
perspectives, inclusive data collection, fairness-aware algorithms, appropriate
evaluation criteria, enhancing human engagement while addressing privacy
concerns, and interactive improvement and regular monitoring. Our framework
aims to guide the development of fair and unbiased ubiquitous computing
systems, ensuring equal treatment and positive societal impact.

greatly transformed speech processing. However, there has been limited research
conducted on evaluating these models for speech emotion recognition (SER)
across multiple languages and examining their internal representations. This
article addresses these gaps by presenting a comprehensive benchmark for SER
with eight speech representation models and six different languages. We
conducted probing experiments to gain insights into inner workings of these
models for SER. We find that using features from a single optimal layer of a
speech model reduces the error rate by 32\% on average across seven datasets
when compared to systems where features from all layers of speech models are
used. We also achieve state-of-the-art results for German and Persian
languages. Our probing results indicate that the middle layers of speech models
capture the most important emotional information for speech emotion
recognition.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a learning-based depth map fusion framework that accepts a set
of depth and confidence maps generated by a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithm
as input and improves them. This is accomplished by integrating volumetric
visibility constraints that encode long-range surface relationships across
different views into an end-to-end trainable architecture. We also introduce a
depth search window estimation sub-network trained jointly with the larger
fusion sub-network to reduce the depth hypothesis search space along each ray.
Our method learns to model depth consensus and violations of visibility
constraints directly from the data; effectively removing the necessity of
fine-tuning fusion parameters. Extensive experiments on MVS datasets show
substantial improvements in the accuracy of the output fused depth and
confidence maps.

<p class="mathjax">Real-time video analytics on edge devices for changing scenes remains a
difficult task. As edge devices are usually resource-constrained, edge deep
neural networks (DNNs) have fewer weights and shallower architectures than
general DNNs. As a result, they only perform well in limited scenarios and are
sensitive to data drift. In this paper, we introduce EdgeMA, a practical and
efficient video analytics system designed to adapt models to shifts in
real-world video streams over time, addressing the data drift problem. EdgeMA
extracts the gray level co-occurrence matrix based statistical texture feature
and uses the Random Forest classifier to detect the domain shift. Moreover, we
have incorporated a method of model adaptation based on importance weighting,
specifically designed to update models to cope with the label distribution
shift. Through rigorous evaluation of EdgeMA on a real-world dataset, our
results illustrate that EdgeMA significantly improves inference accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Thriving underwater applications demand efficient extreme compression
technology to realize the transmission of underwater images (UWIs) in very
narrow underwater bandwidth. However, existing image compression methods
achieve inferior performance on UWIs because they do not consider the
characteristics of UWIs: (1) Multifarious underwater styles of color shift and
distance-dependent clarity, caused by the unique underwater physical imaging;
(2) Massive redundancy between different UWIs, caused by the fact that
different UWIs contain several common ocean objects, which have plenty of
similarities in structures and semantics. To remove redundancy among UWIs, we
first construct an exhaustive underwater multi-scale feature dictionary to
provide coarse-to-fine reference features for UWI compression. Subsequently, an
extreme UWI compression network with reference to the feature dictionary
(RFD-ECNet) is creatively proposed, which utilizes feature match and reference
feature variant to significantly remove redundancy among UWIs. To align the
multifarious underwater styles and improve the accuracy of feature match, an
underwater style normalized block (USNB) is proposed, which utilizes underwater
physical priors extracted from the underwater physical imaging model to
normalize the underwater styles of dictionary features toward the input.
Moreover, a reference feature variant module (RFVM) is designed to adaptively
morph the reference features, improving the similarity between the reference
and input features. Experimental results on four UWI datasets show that our
RFD-ECNet is the first work that achieves a significant BD-rate saving of 31%
over the most advanced VVC.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, transformer networks have demonstrated superior performance in many
computer vision tasks. In a multi-view 3D reconstruction algorithm following
this paradigm, self-attention processing has to deal with intricate image
tokens including massive information when facing heavy amounts of view input.
The curse of information content leads to the extreme difficulty of model
learning. To alleviate this problem, recent methods compress the token number
representing each view or discard the attention operations between the tokens
from different views. Obviously, they give a negative impact on performance.
Therefore, we propose long-range grouping attention (LGA) based on the
divide-and-conquer principle. Tokens from all views are grouped for separate
attention operations. The tokens in each group are sampled from all views and
can provide macro representation for the resided view. The richness of feature
learning is guaranteed by the diversity among different groups. An effective
and efficient encoder can be established which connects inter-view features
using LGA and extract intra-view features using the standard self-attention
layer. Moreover, a novel progressive upsampling decoder is also designed for
voxel generation with relatively high resolution. Hinging on the above, we
construct a powerful transformer-based network, called LRGT. Experimental
results on ShapeNet verify our method achieves SOTA accuracy in multi-view
reconstruction. Code will be available at
https://github.com/LiyingCV/Long-Range-Grouping-Transformer.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models have been trained to predict semantic information
about user interfaces (UIs) to make apps more accessible, easier to test, and
to automate. Currently, most models rely on datasets that are collected and
labeled by human crowd-workers, a process that is costly and surprisingly
error-prone for certain tasks. For example, it is possible to guess if a UI
element is "tappable" from a screenshot (i.e., based on visual signifiers) or
from potentially unreliable metadata (e.g., a view hierarchy), but one way to
know for certain is to programmatically tap the UI element and observe the
effects. We built the Never-ending UI Learner, an app crawler that
automatically installs real apps from a mobile app store and crawls them to
discover new and challenging training examples to learn from. The Never-ending
UI Learner has crawled for more than 5,000 device-hours, performing over half a
million actions on 6,000 apps to train three computer vision models for i)
tappability prediction, ii) draggability prediction, and iii) screen
similarity.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, a robust ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) called MC-EnKF is
proposed for nonlinear state-space model to deal with filtering problems with
non-Gaussian observation noises. Our MC-EnKF is derived based on maximum
correntropy criterion (MCC) with some technical approximations. Moreover, we
propose an effective adaptive strategy for kernel bandwidth selection.Besides,
the relations between the common EnKF and MC-EnKF are given, i.e., MC-EnKF will
converge to the common EnKF when the kernel bandwidth tends to infinity. This
justification provides a complementary understanding of the kernel bandwidth
selection for MC-EnKF. In experiments, non-Gaussian observation noises
significantly reduce the performance of the common EnKF for both linear and
nonlinear systems, whereas our proposed MC-EnKF with a suitable kernel
bandwidth maintains its good performance at only a marginal increase in
computing cost, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency to non-Gaussian
observation noises.

<p class="mathjax">As a vital stage of automated rule checking (ARC), rule interpretation of
regulatory texts requires considerable effort. However, interpreting regulatory
clauses with implicit properties or complex computational logic is still
challenging due to the lack of domain knowledge and limited expressibility of
conventional logic representations. Thus, LLM-FuncMapper, an approach to
identifying predefined functions needed to interpret various regulatory clauses
based on the large language model (LLM), is proposed. First, by systematically
analysis of building codes, a series of atomic functions are defined to capture
shared computational logics of implicit properties and complex constraints,
creating a database of common blocks for interpreting regulatory clauses. Then,
a prompt template with the chain of thought is developed and further enhanced
with a classification-based tuning strategy, to enable common LLMs for
effective function identification. Finally, the proposed approach is validated
with statistical analysis, experiments, and proof of concept. Statistical
analysis reveals a long-tail distribution and high expressibility of the
developed function database, with which almost 100% of computer-processible
clauses can be interpreted and represented as computer-executable codes.
Experiments show that LLM-FuncMapper achieve promising results in identifying
relevant predefined functions for rule interpretation. Further proof of concept
in automated rule interpretation also demonstrates the possibility of
LLM-FuncMapper in interpreting complex regulatory clauses. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is the first attempt to introduce LLM for understanding
and interpreting complex regulatory clauses, which may shed light on further
adoption of LLM in the construction domain.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed the remarkable performance of diffusion models in
various vision tasks. However, for image restoration that aims to recover clear
images with sharper details from given degraded observations, diffusion-based
methods may fail to recover promising results due to inaccurate noise
estimation. Moreover, simple constraining noises cannot effectively learn
complex degradation information, which subsequently hinders the model capacity.
To solve the above problems, we propose a coarse-to-fine diffusion Transformer
(C2F-DFT) for image restoration. Specifically, our C2F-DFT contains diffusion
self-attention (DFSA) and diffusion feed-forward network (DFN) within a new
coarse-to-fine training scheme. The DFSA and DFN respectively capture the
long-range diffusion dependencies and learn hierarchy diffusion representation
to facilitate better restoration. In the coarse training stage, our C2F-DFT
estimates noises and then generates the final clean image by a sampling
algorithm. To further improve the restoration quality, we propose a simple yet
effective fine training scheme. It first exploits the coarse-trained diffusion
model with fixed steps to generate restoration results, which then would be
constrained with corresponding ground-truth ones to optimize the models to
remedy the unsatisfactory results affected by inaccurate noise estimation.
Extensive experiments show that C2F-DFT significantly outperforms
diffusion-based restoration method IR-SDE and achieves competitive performance
compared with Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods on $3$ tasks,
including deraining, deblurring, and real denoising.

<p class="mathjax">Endoscopy plays a major role in identifying any underlying abnormalities
within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are multiple GI tract diseases
that are life-threatening, such as precancerous lesions and other intestinal
cancers. In the usual process, a diagnosis is made by a medical expert which
can be prone to human errors and the accuracy of the test is also entirely
dependent on the expert's level of experience. Deep learning, specifically
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) which are designed to perform automatic
feature learning without any prior feature engineering, has recently reported
great benefits for GI endoscopy image analysis. Previous research has developed
models that focus only on improving performance, as such, the majority of
introduced models contain complex deep network architectures with a large
number of parameters that require longer training times. However, there is a
lack of focus on developing lightweight models which can run in low-resource
environments, which are typically encountered in medical clinics. We
investigate three KD-based learning frameworks, response-based, feature-based,
and relation-based mechanisms, and introduce a novel multi-head attention-based
feature fusion mechanism to support relation-based learning. Compared to the
existing relation-based methods that follow simplistic aggregation techniques
of multi-teacher response/feature-based knowledge, we adopt the multi-head
attention technique to provide flexibility towards localising and transferring
important details from each teacher to better guide the student. We perform
extensive evaluations on two widely used public datasets, KVASIR-V2 and
Hyper-KVASIR, and our experimental results signify the merits of our proposed
relation-based framework in achieving an improved lightweight model (only 51.8k
trainable parameters) that can run in a resource-limited environment.

<p class="mathjax">Logs are an essential source of information for people to understand the
running status of a software system. Due to the evolving modern software
architecture and maintenance methods, more research efforts have been devoted
to automated log analysis. In particular, machine learning (ML) has been widely
used in log analysis tasks. In ML-based log analysis tasks, converting textual
log data into numerical feature vectors is a critical and indispensable step.
However, the impact of using different log representation techniques on the
performance of the downstream models is not clear, which limits researchers and
practitioners' opportunities of choosing the optimal log representation
techniques in their automated log analysis workflows. Therefore, this work
investigates and compares the commonly adopted log representation techniques
from previous log analysis research. Particularly, we select six log
representation techniques and evaluate them with seven ML models and four
public log datasets (i.e., HDFS, BGL, Spirit and Thunderbird) in the context of
log-based anomaly detection. We also examine the impacts of the log parsing
process and the different feature aggregation approaches when they are employed
with log representation techniques. From the experiments, we provide some
heuristic guidelines for future researchers and developers to follow when
designing an automated log analysis workflow. We believe our comprehensive
comparison of log representation techniques can help researchers and
practitioners better understand the characteristics of different log
representation techniques and provide them with guidance for selecting the most
suitable ones for their ML-based log analysis workflow.

<p class="mathjax">Robots have been successfully used to perform tasks with high precision. In
real-world environments with sparse rewards and multiple goals, learning is
still a major challenge and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms fail to
learn good policies. Training in simulation environments and then fine-tuning
in the real world is a common approach. However, adapting to the real-world
setting is a challenge. In this paper, we present a method named Ready for
Production Hierarchical RL (ReProHRL) that divides tasks with hierarchical
multi-goal navigation guided by reinforcement learning. We also use object
detectors as a pre-processing step to learn multi-goal navigation and transfer
it to the real world. Empirical results show that the proposed ReProHRL method
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in simulation and real-world
environments in terms of both training time and performance. Although both
methods achieve a 100% success rate in a simple environment for single
goal-based navigation, in a more complex environment and multi-goal setting,
the proposed method outperforms the baseline by 18% and 5%, respectively. For
the real-world implementation and proof of concept demonstration, we deploy the
proposed method on a nano-drone named Crazyflie with a front camera to perform
multi-goal navigation experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Keyphrase extraction (KPE) is an important task in Natural Language
Processing for many scenarios, which aims to extract keyphrases that are
present in a given document. Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as
sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However,
these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may
result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages
the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text
diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE
first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire
document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase
representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank
loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us
to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases
and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE
methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a
scientific domain dataset, KP20K.

tackling both difficulties with a divide-and-conquer design. In our method,
neural submaps are incrementally allocated alongside the scanning trajectory

be refined individually in a back-end optimization and optimized jointly to
realize submap-level loop closure. Meanwhile, we propose a hybrid tracking
approach combining randomized and gradient-based pose optimizations. For the
first time, randomized optimization is made possible in neural tracking with
several key designs to the learning process, enabling efficient and robust

that our method attains higher reconstruction quality than the state of the

<p class="mathjax">Model editing techniques modify a minor proportion of knowledge in Large
Language Models (LLMs) at a relatively low cost, which have demonstrated
notable success. Existing methods assume Transformer Layer (TL) hidden states
are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). They
usually optimize the TL hidden states to memorize target knowledge and use it
to update the weights of the FFN in LLMs. However, the information flow of TL
hidden states comes from three parts: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), FFN,
and residual connections. Existing methods neglect the fact that the TL hidden
states contains information not specifically required for FFN. Consequently,
the performance of model editing decreases. To achieve more precise model
editing, we analyze hidden states of MHSA and FFN, finding that MHSA encodes
certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This implies that MHSA weights
do not require updating when new knowledge is introduced. Based on above
findings, we introduce PMET, which simultaneously optimizes Transformer
Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN) hidden states, while only using the
optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights. Our
experiments demonstrate that PMET exhibits state-of-the-art performance on both
the \textsc{counterfact} and zsRE datasets. Our ablation experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our enhancements, further reinforcing the
finding that the MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and
indicating its storage of a small amount of factual knowledge. Our code is

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model that has
revolutionised image segmentation. To apply SAM to surgical instrument
segmentation, a common approach is to locate precise points or boxes of
instruments and then use them as prompts for SAM in a zero-shot manner.
However, we observe two problems with this naive pipeline: (1) the domain gap
between natural objects and surgical instruments leads to poor generalisation
of SAM; and (2) SAM relies on precise point or box locations for accurate
segmentation, requiring either extensive manual guidance or a well-performing
specialist detector for prompt preparation, which leads to a complex
multi-stage pipeline. To address these problems, we introduce SurgicalSAM, a
novel end-to-end efficient-tuning approach for SAM to effectively integrate
surgical-specific information with SAM's pre-trained knowledge for improved
generalisation. Specifically, we propose a lightweight prototype-based class
prompt encoder for tuning, which directly generates prompt embeddings from
class prototypes and eliminates the use of explicit prompts for improved
robustness and a simpler pipeline. In addition, to address the low inter-class
variance among surgical instrument categories, we propose contrastive prototype
learning, further enhancing the discrimination of the class prototypes for more

<p class="mathjax">Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a phenomenon that occurs in machine learning
when a model forgets previously learned information as it learns new
information. As large language models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance,
it is interesting to uncover whether CF exists in the continual fine-tuning of
LLMs. In this study, we empirically evaluate the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs'
knowledge, from the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading
comprehension. The experiments demonstrate that catastrophic forgetting is
generally observed in LLMs ranging from 1b to 7b. Furthermore, as the scale
increases, the severity of forgetting also intensifies. Comparing the
decoder-only model BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ suffers
less forgetting and maintains more knowledge. We also observe that LLMs can
mitigate language bias (e.g. gender bias) during continual fine-tuning.
Moreover, we find that ALPACA can maintain more knowledge and capacity compared
with LLAMA during the continual fine-tuning, which implies that general
instruction tuning can help mitigate the forgetting phenomenon of LLMs in the
further fine-tuning process.

<p class="mathjax">Filtering is concerned with online estimation of the state of a dynamical
system from partial and noisy observations. In applications where the state of
the system is high dimensional, ensemble Kalman filters are often the method of
choice. These algorithms rely on an ensemble of interacting particles to
sequentially estimate the state as new observations become available. Despite
the practical success of ensemble Kalman filters, theoretical understanding is
hindered by the intricate dependence structure of the interacting particles.
This paper investigates ensemble Kalman filters that incorporate an additional
resampling step to break the dependency between particles. The new algorithm is
amenable to a theoretical analysis that extends and improves upon those
available for filters without resampling, while also performing well in
numerical examples.

<p class="mathjax">Tracking 3D objects is an important task in autonomous driving. Classical
Kalman Filtering based methods are still the most popular solutions. However,
these methods require handcrafted designs in motion modeling and can not
benefit from the growing data amounts. In this paper, Box Only Transformer
Tracker (BOTT) is proposed to learn to link 3D boxes of the same object from
the different frames, by taking all the 3D boxes in a time window as input.
Specifically, transformer self-attention is applied to exchange information
between all the boxes to learn global-informative box embeddings. The
similarity between these learned embeddings can be used to link the boxes of
the same object. BOTT can be used for both online and offline tracking modes
seamlessly. Its simplicity enables us to significantly reduce engineering
efforts required by traditional Kalman Filtering based methods. Experiments
show BOTT achieves competitive performance on two largest 3D MOT benchmarks:
69.9 and 66.7 AMOTA on nuScenes validation and test splits, respectively, 56.45
and 59.57 MOTA L2 on Waymo Open Dataset validation and test splits,
respectively. This work suggests that tracking 3D objects by learning features
directly from 3D boxes using transformers is a simple yet effective way.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on the recently popular task of point cloud completion
guided by multimodal information. Although existing methods have achieved
excellent performance by fusing auxiliary images, there are still some
deficiencies, including the poor generalization ability of the model and
insufficient fine-grained semantic information for extracted features. In this
work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion network for point cloud completion,
which can simultaneously fuse visual and textual information to predict the
semantic and geometric characteristics of incomplete shapes effectively.
Specifically, to overcome the lack of prior information caused by the
small-scale dataset, we employ a pre-trained vision-language model that is
trained with a large amount of image-text pairs. Therefore, the textual and
visual encoders of this large-scale model have stronger generalization ability.
Then, we propose a multi-stage feature fusion strategy to fuse the textual and
visual features into the backbone network progressively. Meanwhile, to further
explore the effectiveness of fine-grained text descriptions for point cloud
completion, we also build a text corpus with fine-grained descriptions, which
can provide richer geometric details for 3D shapes. The rich text descriptions
can be used for training and evaluating our network. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared to state-of-the-art point cloud completion networks.

<p class="mathjax">Co-occurrence networks are an important method in the field of natural
language processing and text mining for discovering semantic relationships
within texts. However, the traditional traversal algorithm for constructing
co-occurrence networks has high time complexity and space complexity when
dealing with large-scale text data. In this paper, we propose an optimized
algorithm based on inverted indexing and breadth-first search to improve the
efficiency of co-occurrence network construction and reduce memory consumption.
Firstly, the traditional traversal algorithm is analyzed, and its performance
issues in constructing co-occurrence networks are identified. Then, the
detailed implementation process of the optimized algorithm is presented.
Subsequently, the CSL large-scale Chinese scientific literature dataset is used
for experimental validation, comparing the performance of the traditional
traversal algorithm and the optimized algorithm in terms of running time and
memory usage. Finally, using non-parametric test methods, the optimized
algorithm is proven to have significantly better performance than the
traditional traversal algorithm. The research in this paper provides an
effective method for the rapid construction of co-occurrence networks,
contributing to the further development of the Information Organization fields.

<p class="mathjax">Instruction-tuned Language Models (LMs) are widely used by users to address
various problems with task-specific prompts. Constraints associated with the
context window length and computational costs encourage the development of
compressed prompts. Existing methods rely heavily on training embeddings, which
are designed to accommodate multiple token meanings. This presents challenges
in terms of interpretability, a fixed number of embedding tokens, reusability
across different LMs, and inapplicability when interacting with black-box APIs.
This study proposes prompt compression with reinforcement learning (PCRL), a
novel discrete prompt compression method that addresses these issues. PCRL
employs a computationally efficient policy network that directly edits prompts.
The PCRL training approach can be flexibly applied to various types of LMs, as
well as decoder-only and encoder-decoder architecture, and can be trained
without gradient access to LMs or labeled data. PCRL achieves an average
reduction of 24.6% in token count across various instruction prompts while
preserving performance. Further, we demonstrate that the learned policy can be
transferred to larger LMs, and through various analyses, we aid the
understanding of token importance within prompts.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used for edge collaborative
computing in current transmission line object detection, where computationally
intensive tasks generated by user nodes are offloaded to more powerful edge
servers for processing. However, performing edge collaborative processing on
transmission line image data may result in serious privacy breaches. To address
this issue, we propose a secure single-stage detection model called SecYOLOv7
that preserves the privacy of object detecting. Based on secure multi-party
computation (MPC), a series of secure computing protocols are designed for the
collaborative execution of Secure Feature Contraction, Secure Bounding-Box
Prediction and Secure Object Classification by two non-edge servers.
Performance evaluation shows that both computational and communication overhead
in this framework as well as calculation error significantly outperform
existing works.

autonomous driving. Nowadays, we can easily access sensor data represented in
multiple views. However, cross-view consistency has not been evaluated by the
existing models, which might lead to divergences between the multimodal
predictions from different views. It is not practical and effective when the
network does not comprehend the 3D scene, which could cause the downstream
module in a dilemma. Instead, we predicts multimodal trajectories while
maintaining cross-view consistency. We presented a cross-view trajectory
prediction method using shared 3D Queries (XVTP3D). We employ a set of 3D
queries shared across views to generate multi-goals that are cross-view
consistent. We also proposed a random mask method and coarse-to-fine
cross-attention to capture robust cross-view features. As far as we know, this
is the first work that introduces the outstanding top-down paradigm in BEV

acceleration, acoustics, temperature, and spindle speed during the orthogonal
tube turning process as input features. The ML classifier was used to predict
the condition of the tool after the cutting process, which was determined in a
binary class form indicating if the cutting tool was available or failed. After
the training process, the Shapley criterion was used to explain the predictions
of the trained ML classifier. Specifically, the significance of each input

reasoning of the ML classifier predictions. After implementing the Shapley
criterion on all testing datasets, the tool temperature was identified as the
most significant feature in determining the classification of available versus

limited to specific downstream tasks, which hinders their practicality in
real-world applications. This paper presents Chat-3D, which combines the 3D
visual perceptual ability of pre-trained 3D representations and the impressive
reasoning and conversation capabilities of advanced LLMs to achieve the first
universal dialogue systems for 3D scenes. Specifically, we align 3D
representations into the feature space of LLMs, thus enabling LLMs to perceive

three-stage training strategy to efficiently utilize the available data for
better alignment. To enhance the reasoning ability and develop a user-friendly
interaction scheme, we further construct a high-quality object-centric 3D
instruction dataset and design an associated object-centric prompt. Our
experiments show that Chat-3D achieves an impressive ability to comprehend
diverse instructions for 3D scenes, engage in intricate spatial reasoning, and
incorporate external knowledge into its responses. Chat-3D achieves a 75.6%

<p class="mathjax">Due to the complexity of annotation and inter-annotator variability, most
lung nodule malignancy grading datasets contain label noise, which inevitably
degrades the performance and generalizability of models. Although researchers
adopt the label-noise-robust methods to handle label noise for lung nodule
malignancy grading, they do not consider the inherent ordinal relation among
classes of this task. To model the ordinal relation among classes to facilitate
tackling label noise in this task, we propose a Unimodal-Regularized
Label-noise-tolerant (URL) framework. Our URL contains two stages, the
Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) stage and the Memory pseudo-labels
generation and Unimodal regularization (MU) stage. In the SCL stage, we select
reliable samples and adopt supervised contrastive learning to learn better
representations. In the MU stage, we split samples with multiple annotations
into multiple samples with a single annotation and shuffle them into different
batches. To handle label noise, pseudo-labels are generated using the
similarity between each sample and the central feature of each class, and
temporal ensembling is used to obtain memory pseudo-labels that supervise the
model training. To model the ordinal relation, we introduce unimodal
regularization to keep the ordinal relation among classes in the predictions.
Moreover, each lung nodule is characterized by three orthographic views.
Experiments conducted on the LIDC-IDRI dataset indicate the superiority of our
URL over other competing methods. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Language models such as mBERT, XLM-R, and BLOOM aim to achieve multilingual
generalization or compression to facilitate transfer to a large number of
(potentially unseen) languages. However, these models should ideally also be
private, linguistically fair, and transparent, by relating their predictions to
training data. Can these requirements be simultaneously satisfied? We show that
multilingual compression and linguistic fairness are compatible with
differential privacy, but that differential privacy is at odds with training
data influence sparsity, an objective for transparency. We further present a
series of experiments on two common NLP tasks and evaluate multilingual
compression and training data influence sparsity under different privacy
guarantees, exploring these trade-offs in more detail. Our results suggest that
we need to develop ways to jointly optimize for these objectives in order to
find practical trade-offs.

<p class="mathjax">We aim at incorporating explicit shape information into current 3D organ
segmentation models. Different from previous works, we formulate shape learning
as an in-painting task, which is named Masked Label Mask Modeling (MLM).
Through MLM, learnable mask tokens are fed into transformer blocks to complete
the label mask of organ. To transfer MLM shape knowledge to target, we further
propose a novel shape-aware self-distillation with both in-painting
reconstruction loss and pseudo loss. Extensive experiments on five public organ
segmentation datasets show consistent improvements over prior arts with at
least 1.2 points gain in the Dice score, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
method in challenging unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios including: (1)
In-domain organ segmentation; (2) Unseen domain segmentation and (3) Unseen
organ segmentation. We hope this work will advance shape analysis and geometric
learning in medical imaging.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks are often trained with empirical risk minimization; however,
it has been shown that a shift between training and testing distributions can
cause unpredictable performance degradation. On this issue, a research
direction, invariant learning, has been proposed to extract invariant features
insensitive to the distributional changes. This work proposes EDNIL, an
invariant learning framework containing a multi-head neural network to absorb
data biases. We show that this framework does not require prior knowledge about
environments or strong assumptions about the pre-trained model. We also reveal
that the proposed algorithm has theoretical connections to recent studies
discussing properties of variant and invariant features. Finally, we
demonstrate that models trained with EDNIL are empirically more robust against
distributional shifts.

<p class="mathjax">In-context learning (ICL) operates by showing language models (LMs) examples
of input-output pairs for a given task, i.e., demonstrations. The standard
approach for ICL is to prompt the LM with concatenated demonstrations followed
by the test input. This approach suffers from some issues. First, concatenation
offers almost no control over the contribution of each demo to the model
prediction. This can be sub-optimal when some demonstrations are irrelevant to
the test example. Second, due to the input length limit of some transformer
models, it might be infeasible to fit many examples into the context,
especially when dealing with long-input tasks. In this work, we explore
Demonstration Ensembling (DENSE) as an alternative to simple concatenation.
\model predicts outputs using subsets (i.e., buckets) of the demonstrations and
then combines the output probabilities resulting from each subset to produce
the final prediction. We study different ensembling methods using GPT-j and
experiment on 12 language tasks. Our experiments show weighted max ensembling
to outperform vanilla concatenation by as large as 2.4 average points. Code

<p class="mathjax">In natural language processing, transformer-based large language models
(LLMs) like GPT-x models developed by OpenAI have revolutionized the landscape.
Despite their impressive capabilities, these models often encounter challenges
when handling tasks that differ from their training data, resulting in
compromised performance. To address this, few-shot learning has emerged as a
valuable technique, allowing LLMs to adapt with minimal task-specific data. One
innovative strategy, known as Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT), has been
introduced to guide LLMs in revealing cognitive processes during multi-step
reasoning. In this paper, we propose Code Chain-of-Thought~(CodeCoT), which
consists of two components: the Vanilla CodeCoT and the Self-exam CodeCoT. The
latter incorporates self-examination, empowering the model to iteratively
generate code, formulate test cases, and refine its outputs. Specifically, the
process entails the generation of test examples by the model corresponding to
the code it is tasked to implement. If it fails on the test examples, then it
regenerates the code based on the erroneous code and associated error types.
Through comprehensive experiments, we observed that both techniques
significantly enhance code generation accuracy across various LLM variants. Our
evaluation results reveal that CodeCoT improves the code generation
effectiveness, including an unprecedented pass@1 accuracy of 79.27\% using the
Self-exam CodeCoT approach on the gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 model in the HumanEval
dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Conventional beamforming with fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays has a
fundamental trade-off between maximizing the signal power (array gain) over a
desired direction and simultaneously minimizing the interference power over
undesired directions. To overcome this limitation, this letter investigates the
movable antenna (MA) array enhanced beamforming by exploiting the new degree of
freedom (DoF) via antenna position optimization, in addition to the design of
antenna weights. We show that by jointly optimizing the antenna positions
vector (APV) and antenna weights vector (AWV) of a linear MA array, the full
array gain can be achieved over the desired direction while null steering can
be realized over all undesired directions, under certain numbers of MAs and
null-steering directions. The optimal solutions for AWV and APV are derived in
closed form, which reveal that the optimal AWV for MA arrays requires only the
signal phase adjustment with a fixed amplitude. Numerical results validate our
analytical solutions for MA array beamforming and show their superior
performance to the conventional beamforming techniques with FPA arrays.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers a cyber-physical system under an active eavesdropping
attack. A remote legitimate user estimates the state of a linear plant from the
state information received from a sensor. Transmissions from the sensor occur
via an insecure and unreliable network. An active eavesdropper may perform an
attack during system operation. The eavesdropper intercepts transmissions from
the sensor, whilst simultaneously sabotaging the data transfer from the sensor
to the remote legitimate user to harm its estimation performance. To maintain
state confidentiality, we propose an encoding scheme that is activated on the
detection of an eavesdropper. Our scheme transmits noise based on a
pseudo-random indicator, pre-arranged at the legitimate user and sensor. The
transmission of noise harms the eavesdropper's performance, more than that of
the legitimate user. Using the proposed encoding scheme, we impair the
eavesdropper's expected estimation performance, whilst minimising expected
performance degradation at the legitimate user. We explore the trade-off
between state confidentiality and legitimate user performance degradation
through selecting the probability that the sensor transmits noise. Under
certain design choices, the trace of the expected estimation error covariance
of the eavesdropper is greater than that of the legitimate user. Numerical
examples are provided to illustrate the proposed encoding scheme.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional problems in computational geometry involve aspects that are both
discrete and continuous. One such example is nearest-neighbor searching, where
the input is discrete, but the result depends on distances, which vary
continuously. In many real-world applications of geometric data structures, it
is assumed that query results are continuous, free of jump discontinuities.
This is at odds with many modern data structures in computational geometry,
which employ approximations to achieve efficiency, but these approximations
often suffer from discontinuities.
<br />In this paper, we present a general method for transforming an approximate
but discontinuous data structure into one that produces a smooth approximation,
while matching the asymptotic space efficiencies of the original. We achieve
this by adapting an approach called the partition-of-unity method, which
smoothly blends multiple local approximations into a single smooth global
approximation.
<br />We illustrate the use of this technique in a specific application of
approximating the distance to the boundary of a convex polytope in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ from any point in its interior. We begin by developing a novel
data structure that efficiently computes an absolute
$\varepsilon$-approximation to this query in time $O(\log (1/\varepsilon))$
using $O(1/\varepsilon^{d/2})$ storage space. Then, we proceed to apply the
proposed partition-of-unity blending to guarantee the smoothness of the
approximate distance field, establishing optimal asymptotic bounds on the norms
of its gradient and Hessian.

<p class="mathjax">With the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), maintaining power
grid stability has become a significant challenge. To address this issue, EV
charging control strategies have been developed to manage the switch between
vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes for EVs. In this context,
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has proven its effectiveness in
EV charging control. However, existing MADRL-based approaches fail to consider
the natural power flow of EV charging/discharging in the distribution network
and ignore driver privacy. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a
novel approach that combines multi-EV charging/discharging with a radial
distribution network (RDN) operating under optimal power flow (OPF) to
distribute power flow in real time. A mathematical model is developed to
describe the RDN load. The EV charging control problem is formulated as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find an optimal charging control strategy that
balances V2G profits, RDN load, and driver anxiety. To effectively learn the
optimal EV charging control strategy, a federated deep reinforcement learning
algorithm named FedSAC is further proposed. Comprehensive simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm in
terms of the diversity of the charging control strategy, the power fluctuations
on RDN, the convergence efficiency, and the generalization ability.

<p class="mathjax">Incremental Named Entity Recognition (INER) involves the sequential learning
of new entity types without accessing the training data of previously learned
types. However, INER faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting specific
for incremental learning, further aggravated by background shift (i.e., old and
future entity types are labeled as the non-entity type in the current task). To
address these challenges, we propose a method called task Relation Distillation
and Prototypical pseudo label (RDP) for INER. Specifically, to tackle
catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a task relation distillation scheme that
serves two purposes: 1) ensuring inter-task semantic consistency across
different incremental learning tasks by minimizing inter-task relation
distillation loss, and 2) enhancing the model's prediction confidence by
minimizing intra-task self-entropy loss. Simultaneously, to mitigate background
shift, we develop a prototypical pseudo label strategy that distinguishes old
entity types from the current non-entity type using the old model. This
strategy generates high-quality pseudo labels by measuring the distances
between token embeddings and type-wise prototypes. We conducted extensive
experiments on ten INER settings of three benchmark datasets (i.e., CoNLL2003,
I2B2, and OntoNotes5). The results demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods, with an
average increase of 6.08% in Micro F1 score and 7.71% in Macro F1 score.

<p class="mathjax">Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the
evolution of non-stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance,
increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic
decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In
this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems
using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between
function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ
it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In
particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping
points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conserved
quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these
abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our
proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential
equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also
apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud
cover. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate
physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC), which aims to detect
and correct potential spelling errors in a given sentence. Current
state-of-the-art methods regard CSC as a sequence tagging task and fine-tune
BERT-based models on sentence pairs. However, we note a critical flaw in the
process of tagging one character to another, that the correction is excessively
conditioned on the error. This is opposite from human mindset, where
individuals rephrase the complete sentence based on its semantics, rather than
solely on the error patterns memorized before. Such a counter-intuitive
learning process results in the bottleneck of generalizability and
transferability of machine spelling correction. To address this, we propose
$Rephrasing Language Modeling$ (ReLM), where the model is trained to rephrase
the entire sentence by infilling additional slots, instead of
character-to-character tagging. This novel training paradigm achieves the new
state-of-the-art results across fine-tuned and zero-shot CSC benchmarks,
outperforming previous counterparts by a large margin. Our method also learns
transferable language representation when CSC is jointly trained with other
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Human gender classification based on biometric features is a major concern
for computer vision due to its vast variety of applications. The human ear is
popular among researchers as a soft biometric trait, because it is less
affected by age or changing circumstances, and is non-intrusive. In this study,
we have developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automatic
gender classification using the samples of ear images. The performance is
evaluated using four cutting-edge pre-trained CNN models. In terms of trainable
parameters, the proposed technique requires significantly less computational
complexity. The proposed model has achieved 93% accuracy on the EarVN1.0 ear

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems have been gaining increasing research attention over the
years. Most existing recommendation methods focus on capturing users'
personalized preferences through historical user-item interactions, which may
potentially violate user privacy. Additionally, these approaches often overlook
the significance of the temporal fluctuation in item popularity that can sway
users' decision-making. To bridge this gap, we propose Popularity-Aware
Recommender (PARE), which makes non-personalized recommendations by predicting
the items that will attain the highest popularity. PARE consists of four
modules, each focusing on a different aspect: popularity history, temporal
impact, periodic impact, and side information. Finally, an attention layer is
leveraged to fuse the outputs of four modules. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to explicitly model item popularity in recommendation systems.
Extensive experiments show that PARE performs on par or even better than
sophisticated state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Since PARE prioritizes
item popularity over personalized user preferences, it can enhance existing
recommendation methods as a complementary component. Our experiments
demonstrate that integrating PARE with existing recommendation methods
significantly surpasses the performance of standalone models, highlighting
PARE's potential as a complement to existing recommendation methods.
Furthermore, the simplicity of PARE makes it immensely practical for industrial
applications and a valuable baseline for future research.

<p class="mathjax">The security of confidential information associated with devices in the
industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network is a serious concern. This article
focuses on achieving a nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled secure IIoT
network in the presence of untrusted devices by jointly optimizing the
resources, such as decoding order and power allocated to devices. Assuming that
the devices are resource-constrained for performing perfect successive
interference cancellation (SIC), we characterize the residual interference at
receivers with the linear model. Firstly, considering all possible decoding
orders in an untrusted scenario, we obtain secure decoding orders that are
feasible to obtain a positive secrecy rate for each device. Then, under the
secrecy fairness criterion, we formulate a joint optimization problem of
maximizing the minimum secrecy rate among devices. Since the formulated problem
is non-convex and combinatorial, we first obtain the optimal secure decoding
order and then solve it for power allocation by analyzing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
points. Thus, we provide the closed-form global-optimal solution of the
formulated optimization problem. Numerical results validate the analytical
claims and demonstrate an interesting observation that the conventional
decoding order and assigning more power allocation to the weak device, as
presumed in many works on NOMA, is not an optimal strategy from the secrecy
fairness viewpoint. Also, the average percentage gain of about 22.75%, 50.58%,
94.59%, and 98.16%, respectively, is achieved by jointly optimized solution
over benchmarks ODEP (optimal decoding order, equal power allocation), ODFP
(optimal decoding order, fixed power allocation), FDEP (fixed decoding order,
equal power allocation), and FDFP (fixed decoding order, fixed power
allocation).

<p class="mathjax">In the past few years, cybersecurity is becoming very important due to the
rise in internet users. The internet attacks such as Denial of service (DoS)
and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks severely harm a website or
server and make them unavailable to other users. Network Monitoring and control
systems have found it challenging to identify the many classes of DoS and DDoS
attacks since each operates uniquely. Hence a powerful technique is required
for attack detection. Traditional machine learning techniques are inefficient
in handling extensive network data and cannot extract high-level features for
attack detection. Therefore, an effective deep learning-based intrusion
detection system is developed in this paper for DoS and DDoS attack
classification. This model includes various phases and starts with the Deep
Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) based technique to
address the class imbalance issue in the dataset. Then a deep learning
algorithm based on ResNet-50 extracts the critical features for each class in
the dataset. After that, an optimized AlexNet-based classifier is implemented
for detecting the attacks separately, and the essential parameters of the
classifier are optimized using the Atom search optimization algorithm. The
proposed approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets, CCIDS2019 and UNSW-NB15,
using key classification metrics and achieved 99.37% accuracy for the UNSW-NB15
dataset and 99.33% for the CICIDS2019 dataset. The investigational results
demonstrate that the suggested approach performs superior to other competitive
techniques in identifying DoS and DDoS attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) serves multiple users simultaneously
via the same resource block by exploiting superposition coding at the
transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers.
Under practical considerations, perfect SIC may not be achieved. Thus, residual
interference (RI) occurs inevitably due to imperfect SIC. In this work, we
first propose a novel model for characterizing RI to provide a more realistic
secrecy performance analysis of a downlink NOMA system under imperfect SIC at
receivers. In the presence of untrusted users, NOMA has an inherent security
flaw. Therefore, for this untrusted users' scenario, we derive new analytical
expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) for each user in a two-user
untrusted NOMA system by using the proposed RI model. To further shed light on
the obtained results and obtain a deeper understanding, a high signal-to-noise
ratio approximation of the SOPs is also obtained. Lastly, numerical
investigations are provided to validate the accuracy of the desired analytical
results and present valuable insights into the impact of various system
parameters on the secrecy rate performance of the secure NOMA communication
system.

<p class="mathjax">Text recognition methods are gaining rapid development. Some advanced
techniques, e.g., powerful modules, language models, and un- and
semi-supervised learning schemes, consecutively push the performance on public
benchmarks forward. However, the problem of how to better optimize a text
recognition model from the perspective of loss functions is largely overlooked.
CTC-based methods, widely used in practice due to their good balance between
performance and inference speed, still grapple with accuracy degradation. This
is because CTC loss emphasizes the optimization of the entire sequence target
while neglecting to learn individual characters. We propose a self-distillation
scheme for CTC-based model to address this issue. It incorporates a framewise
regularization term in CTC loss to emphasize individual supervision, and
leverages the maximizing-a-posteriori of latent alignment to solve the
inconsistency problem that arises in distillation between CTC-based models. We
refer to the regularized CTC loss as Distillation Connectionist Temporal
Classification (DCTC) loss. DCTC loss is module-free, requiring no extra
parameters, longer inference lag, or additional training data or phases.
Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DCTC can boost text
recognition model accuracy by up to 2.6%, without any of these drawbacks.

<p class="mathjax">The primary focus of this thesis is to make Sanskrit manuscripts more
accessible to the end-users through natural language technologies. The
morphological richness, compounding, free word orderliness, and low-resource
nature of Sanskrit pose significant challenges for developing deep learning
solutions. We identify four fundamental tasks, which are crucial for developing
a robust NLP technology for Sanskrit: word segmentation, dependency parsing,
compound type identification, and poetry analysis. The first task, Sanskrit
Word Segmentation (SWS), is a fundamental text processing task for any other
downstream applications. However, it is challenging due to the sandhi
phenomenon that modifies characters at word boundaries. Similarly, the existing
dependency parsing approaches struggle with morphologically rich and
low-resource languages like Sanskrit. Compound type identification is also
challenging for Sanskrit due to the context-sensitive semantic relation between
components. All these challenges result in sub-optimal performance in NLP
applications like question answering and machine translation. Finally, Sanskrit
poetry has not been extensively studied in computational linguistics.
<br />While addressing these challenges, this thesis makes various contributions:
(1) The thesis proposes linguistically-informed neural architectures for these
tasks. (2) We showcase the interpretability and multilingual extension of the
proposed systems. (3) Our proposed systems report state-of-the-art performance.
(4) Finally, we present a neural toolkit named SanskritShala, a web-based
application that provides real-time analysis of input for various NLP tasks.
Overall, this thesis contributes to making Sanskrit manuscripts more accessible
by developing robust NLP technology and releasing various resources, datasets,
and web-based toolkit.

<p class="mathjax">Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model to the target
domain in a batch-by-batch manner during inference. While label distributions
often exhibit imbalances in real-world scenarios, most previous TTA approaches
typically assume that both source and target domain datasets have balanced
label distribution. Due to the fact that certain classes appear more frequently
in certain domains (e.g., buildings in cities, trees in forests), it is natural
that the label distribution shifts as the domain changes. However, we discover
that the majority of existing TTA methods fail to address the coexistence of
covariate and label shifts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel label
shift adapter that can be incorporated into existing TTA approaches to deal
with label shifts during the TTA process effectively. Specifically, we estimate
the label distribution of the target domain to feed it into the label shift
adapter. Subsequently, the label shift adapter produces optimal parameters for
the target label distribution. By predicting only the parameters for a part of
the pre-trained source model, our approach is computationally efficient and can
be easily applied, regardless of the model architectures. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that integrating our strategy with TTA approaches
leads to substantial performance improvements under the joint presence of label
and covariate shifts.

<p class="mathjax">Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has come to the fore as a spectrally
efficient technique for fifth-generation networks and beyond. At the same time,
NOMA faces severe security issues in the presence of untrusted users due to
successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based decoding at receivers. In this
paper, to make the system model more realistic, we consider the impact of
imperfect SIC during the decoding process. Assuming the downlink mode, we focus
on designing a secure NOMA communication protocol for the considered system
model with two untrusted users. In this regard, we obtain the power allocation
bounds to achieve a positive secrecy rate for both near and far users.
Analytical expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both users are
derived to analyze secrecy performance. Closed-form approximations of SOPs are
also provided to gain analytical insights. Lastly, numerical results have been
presented, which validate the exactness of the analysis and reveal the effect

<p class="mathjax">Single-image 3D reconstruction is a research challenge focused on predicting
3D object shapes from single-view images. This task requires significant data
acquisition to predict both visible and occluded portions of the shape.
Furthermore, learning-based methods face the difficulty of creating a
comprehensive training dataset for all possible classes. To this end, we
propose a continual learning-based 3D reconstruction method where our goal is
to design a model using Variational Priors that can still reconstruct the
previously seen classes reasonably even after training on new classes.
Variational Priors represent abstract shapes and combat forgetting, whereas
saliency maps preserve object attributes with less memory usage. This is vital
due to resource constraints in storing extensive training data. Additionally,
we introduce saliency map-based experience replay to capture global and
distinct object features. Thorough experiments show competitive results
compared to established methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has come to the fore as a
spectral-efficient technique for fifth-generation and beyond communication
networks. We consider the downlink of a NOMA system with untrusted users. In
order to consider a more realistic scenario, imperfect successive interference
cancellation is assumed at the receivers during the decoding process. Since
pair outage probability (POP) ensures a minimum rate guarantee to each user, it
behaves as a measure of the quality of service for the pair of users. With the
objective of designing a reliable communication protocol, we derive the
closed-form expression of POP. Further, we find the optimal power allocation
that minimizes the POP. Lastly, numerical results have been presented which
validate the exactness of the analysis, and reveal the effect of various key
parameters on achieved pair outage performance. In addition, we benchmark
optimal power allocation against equal and fixed power allocations with respect
to POP. The results indicate that optimal power allocation results in improved
communication reliability.

<p class="mathjax">Blind Super-Resolution (SR) usually involves two sub-problems: 1) estimating
the degradation of the given low-resolution (LR) image; 2) super-resolving the
LR image to its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. Both problems are ill-posed
due to the information loss in the degrading process. Most previous methods try
to solve the two problems independently, but often fall into a dilemma: a good
super-resolved HR result requires an accurate degradation estimation, which
however, is difficult to be obtained without the help of original HR
information. To address this issue, instead of considering these two problems
independently, we adopt an alternating optimization algorithm, which can
estimate the degradation and restore the SR image in a single model.
Specifically, we design two convolutional neural modules, namely
\textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator}. \textit{Restorer} restores the SR
image based on the estimated degradation, and \textit{Estimator} estimates the
degradation with the help of the restored SR image. We alternate these two
modules repeatedly and unfold this process to form an end-to-end trainable
network. In this way, both \textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator} could get
benefited from the intermediate results of each other, and make each
sub-problem easier. Moreover, \textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator} are
optimized in an end-to-end manner, thus they could get more tolerant of the
estimation deviations of each other and cooperate better to achieve more robust
and accurate final results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets
and real-world images show that the proposed method can largely outperform
state-of-the-art methods and produce more visually favorable results. The codes
are rleased at \url{https://github.com/greatlog/RealDAN.git}.

<p class="mathjax">Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been recognized as one of the key
enabling technologies for future generation wireless networks. Sharing the same
time-frequency resource among users imposes secrecy challenges in NOMA in the
presence of untrusted users. This paper characterizes the impact of user-pair
selection on the secrecy performance of an untrusted NOMA system. In this
regard, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the secrecy rate of
the strong user while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) demands of the
user with poorer channel conditions. To solve this problem, we first obtain
optimal power allocation in a two-user NOMA system, and then investigate the
user-pair selection problem in a more generalized four user NOMA system.
Extensive performance evaluations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the
proposed results and present valuable insights on the impact of various system
parameters on the secrecy performance of the NOMA communication system.

<p class="mathjax">Learning from label proportions (LLP) is a promising weakly supervised
learning problem. In LLP, a set of instances (bag) has label proportions, but
no instance-level labels are given. LLP aims to train an instance-level
classifier by using the label proportions of the bag. In this paper, we propose
a bag-level data augmentation method for LLP called MixBag, based on the key
observation from our preliminary experiments; that the instance-level
classification accuracy improves as the number of labeled bags increases even
though the total number of instances is fixed. We also propose a confidence
interval loss designed based on statistical theory to use the augmented bags
effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose
bag-level data augmentation for LLP. The advantage of MixBag is that it can be
applied to instance-level data augmentation techniques and any LLP method that
uses the proportion loss. Experimental results demonstrate this advantage and
the effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Active Learning (GAL), which aims to find the most informative nodes in
graphs for annotation to maximize the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) performance,
has attracted many research efforts but remains non-trivial challenges. One
major challenge is that existing GAL strategies may introduce semantic
confusion to the selected training set, particularly when graphs are noisy.
Specifically, most existing methods assume all aggregating features to be
helpful, ignoring the semantically negative effect between inter-class edges
under the message-passing mechanism. In this work, we present Semantic-aware
Active learning framework for Graphs (SAG) to mitigate the semantic confusion
problem. Pairwise similarities and dissimilarities of nodes with semantic
features are introduced to jointly evaluate the node influence. A new
prototype-based criterion and query policy are also designed to maintain
diversity and class balance of the selected nodes, respectively. Extensive
experiments on the public benchmark graphs and a real-world financial dataset
demonstrate that SAG significantly improves node classification performances
and consistently outperforms previous methods. Moreover, comprehensive analysis
and ablation study also verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">Safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and social robots
require fast computation and accurate probability density estimation on
trajectory prediction. To address both requirements, this paper presents a new
normalizing flow-based trajectory prediction model named FlowChain. FlowChain
is a stack of conditional continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) that are expressive
and allow analytical probability density computation. This analytical
computation is faster than the generative models that need additional
approximations such as kernel density estimation. Moreover, FlowChain is more
accurate than the Gaussian mixture-based models due to fewer assumptions on the
estimated density. FlowChain also allows a rapid update of estimated
probability densities. This update is achieved by adopting the \textit{newest
observed position} and reusing the flow transformations and its
log-det-jacobians that represent the \textit{motion trend}. This update is
completed in less than one millisecond because this reuse greatly omits the
computational cost. Experimental results showed our FlowChain achieved
state-of-the-art trajectory prediction accuracy compared to previous methods.
Furthermore, our FlowChain demonstrated superiority in the accuracy and speed
of density estimation. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">A learner aims to minimize a function $f$ by repeatedly querying a
distributed oracle that provides noisy gradient evaluations. At the same time,
the learner seeks to hide $\arg\min f$ from a malicious eavesdropper that
observes the learner's queries. This paper considers the problem of
\textit{covert} or \textit{learner-private} optimization, where the learner has
to dynamically choose between learning and obfuscation by exploiting the
stochasticity. The problem of controlling the stochastic gradient algorithm for
covert optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process, and we show that
the dynamic programming operator has a supermodular structure implying that the
optimal policy has a monotone threshold structure. A computationally efficient
policy gradient algorithm is proposed to search for the optimal querying policy
without knowledge of the transition probabilities. As a practical application,
our methods are demonstrated on a hate speech classification task in a
federated setting where an eavesdropper can use the optimal weights to generate
toxic content, which is more easily misclassified. Numerical results show that
when the learner uses the optimal policy, an eavesdropper can only achieve a
validation accuracy of $52\%$ with no information and $69\%$ when it has a
public dataset with 10\% positive samples compared to $83\%$ when the learner
employs a greedy policy.

<p class="mathjax">Weighted model counting (WMC) is the task of computing the weighted sum of
all satisfying assignments (i.e., models) of a propositional formula.
Similarly, weighted model sampling (WMS) aims to randomly generate models with
probability proportional to their respective weights. Both WMC and WMS are hard
to solve exactly, falling under the \#P-hard complexity class. However, it is
known that the counting problem may sometimes be tractable, if the
propositional formula can be compactly represented and expressed in first-order
logic. In such cases, model counting problems can be solved in time polynomial
in the domain size, and are known as \textit{domain-liftable}. The following
question then arises: Is it also the case for weighted model sampling? This
paper addresses this question and answers it affirmatively. Specifically, we
prove the \textit{domain-liftability under sampling} for the two-variables
fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers in this paper, by
devising an efficient sampling algorithm for this fragment that runs in time
polynomial in the domain size. We then further show that this result continues
to hold even in the presence of cardinality constraints. To empirically verify
our approach, we conduct experiments over various first-order formulas designed
for the uniform generation of combinatorial structures and sampling in
statistical-relational models. The results demonstrate that our algorithm
outperforms a start-of-the-art WMS sampler by a substantial margin, confirming
the theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a possibility to make a great
breakthrough in medicine. The establishment of a standardized medical benchmark
becomes a fundamental cornerstone to measure progression. However, medical
environments in different regions have their local characteristics, e.g., the
ubiquity and significance of traditional Chinese medicine within China.
Therefore, merely translating English-based medical evaluation may result in
\textit{contextual incongruities} to a local region. To solve the issue, we
propose a localized medical benchmark called CMB, a Comprehensive Medical
Benchmark in Chinese, designed and rooted entirely within the native Chinese
linguistic and cultural framework. While traditional Chinese medicine is
integral to this evaluation, it does not constitute its entirety. Using this
benchmark, we have evaluated several prominent large-scale LLMs, including
ChatGPT, GPT-4, dedicated Chinese LLMs, and LLMs specialized in the medical
domain. It is worth noting that our benchmark is not devised as a leaderboard
competition but as an instrument for self-assessment of model advancements. We
hope this benchmark could facilitate the widespread adoption and enhancement of
medical LLMs within China. Check details in

<p class="mathjax">Developers write logging statements to generate logs that provide run-time
information for various tasks. The readability of log messages in the logging
statements (i.e., the descriptive text) is rather crucial to the value of the
generated logs. Immature log messages may slow down or even obstruct the
process of log analysis. Despite the importance of log messages, there is still
a lack of standards on what constitutes good readability in log messages and
how to write them. In this paper, we conduct a series of interviews with 17
industrial practitioners to investigate their expectations on the readability
of log messages. Through the interviews, we derive three aspects related to the
readability of log messages, including Structure, Information, and Wording,
along with several specific practices to improve each aspect. We validate our
findings through a series of online questionnaire surveys and receive positive
feedback from the participants. We then manually investigate the readability of
log messages in large-scale open source systems and find that a large portion
(38.1%) of the log messages have inadequate readability. Motivated by such
observation, we further explore the potential of automatically classifying the
readability of log messages using deep learning and machine learning models. We
find that both deep learning and machine learning models can effectively
classify the readability of log messages with a balanced accuracy above 80.0%
on average. Our study provides comprehensive guidelines for composing log
messages to further improve practitioners' logging practices.

<p class="mathjax">Additive manufacturing has enabled the production of more advanced reactor
geometries, resulting in the potential for significantly larger and more
complex design spaces. Identifying and optimising promising configurations
within broader design spaces presents a significant challenge for existing
human-centric design approaches. As such, existing parameterisations of
coiled-tube reactor geometries are low-dimensional with expensive optimisation
limiting more complex solutions. Given algorithmic improvements and the onset
of additive manufacturing, we propose two novel coiled-tube parameterisations
enabling the variation of cross-section and coil path, resulting in a series of
high dimensional, complex optimisation problems. To ensure tractable, non-local
optimisation where gradients are not available, we apply multi-fidelity
Bayesian optimisation. Our approach characterises multiple continuous
fidelities and is coupled with parameterised meshing and simulation, enabling
lower quality, but faster simulations to be exploited throughout optimisation.
Through maximising the plug-flow performance, we identify key characteristics
of optimal reactor designs, and extrapolate these to produce two novel
geometries that we 3D print and experimentally validate. By demonstrating the
design, optimisation, and manufacture of highly parameterised reactors, we seek
to establish a framework for the next-generation of reactors, demonstrating
that intelligent design coupled with new manufacturing processes can
significantly improve the performance and sustainability of future chemical
processes.

<p class="mathjax">Computing the reachability probability in infinite state probabilistic models
has been the topic of numerous works. Here we introduce a new property called
\emph{divergence} that when satisfied allows to compute reachability
probabilities up to an arbitrary precision. One of the main interest of
divergence is that our algorithm does not require the reachability problem to
be decidable. Then we study the decidability of divergence for probabilistic
versions of pushdown automata and Petri nets where the weights associated with
transitions may also depend on the current state. This should be contrasted
with most of the existing works that assume weights independent of the state.
Such an extended framework is motivated by the modeling of real case studies.
Moreover, we exhibit some divergent subclasses of channel systems and pushdown
automata, particularly suited for specifying open distributed systems and
networks prone to performance collapsing in order to compute the probabilities
related to service requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Bokeh is widely used in photography to draw attention to the subject while
effectively isolating distractions in the background. Computational methods
simulate bokeh effects without relying on a physical camera lens. However, in
the realm of digital bokeh synthesis, the two main challenges for bokeh
synthesis are color bleeding and partial occlusion at object boundaries. Our
primary goal is to overcome these two major challenges using physics principles
that define bokeh formation. To achieve this, we propose a novel and accurate
filtering-based bokeh rendering equation and a physically-based occlusion-aware
bokeh renderer, dubbed Dr.Bokeh, which addresses the aforementioned challenges
during the rendering stage without the need of post-processing or data-driven
approaches. Our rendering algorithm first preprocesses the input RGBD to obtain
a layered scene representation. Dr.Bokeh then takes the layered representation
and user-defined lens parameters to render photo-realistic lens blur. By
softening non-differentiable operations, we make Dr.Bokeh differentiable such
that it can be plugged into a machine-learning framework. We perform
quantitative and qualitative evaluations on synthetic and real-world images to
validate the effectiveness of the rendering quality and the differentiability
of our method. We show Dr.Bokeh not only outperforms state-of-the-art bokeh
rendering algorithms in terms of photo-realism but also improves the depth
quality from depth-from-defocus.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate estimation of the internal states of lithium-ion batteries is key
towards improving their management for safety, efficiency and longevity
purposes. Various approaches exist in the literature in this context, among
which designing an observer based on an electrochemical model of the battery
dynamics. With this approach, the performance of the observer depends on the
accuracy of the considered model. It appears that electrochemical models, and
thus their associated observer, typically require to be of high dimension to
generate accurate internal variables. In this work, we present a method to
mitigate this limitation by correcting the lithium concentrations generated by
a general class of finite-dimensional electrochemical models such that they
asymptotically match those generated by the original partial differential
equations (PDE) they are based on, for constant input currents. These
corrections apply irrespectively of the order of the considered
finite-dimensional model. The proposed correction leads to a new state space
model for which we design observers, whose global, robust convergences are
supported by a Lyapunov analysis. Both numerical and experimental validations
are presented, which show the improvement of the accuracy of the state
estimates as a result of the proposed corrections.

<p class="mathjax">Body language (BL) refers to the non-verbal communication expressed through
physical movements, gestures, facial expressions, and postures. It is a form of
communication that conveys information, emotions, attitudes, and intentions
without the use of spoken or written words. It plays a crucial role in
interpersonal interactions and can complement or even override verbal
communication. Deep multi-modal learning techniques have shown promise in
understanding and analyzing these diverse aspects of BL. The survey emphasizes
their applications to BL generation and recognition. Several common BLs are
considered i.e., Sign Language (SL), Cued Speech (CS), Co-speech (CoS), and
Talking Head (TH), and we have conducted an analysis and established the
connections among these four BL for the first time. Their generation and
recognition often involve multi-modal approaches. Benchmark datasets for BL
research are well collected and organized, along with the evaluation of SOTA
methods on these datasets. The survey highlights challenges such as limited
labeled data, multi-modal learning, and the need for domain adaptation to
generalize models to unseen speakers or languages. Future research directions
are presented, including exploring self-supervised learning techniques,
integrating contextual information from other modalities, and exploiting
large-scale pre-trained multi-modal models. In summary, this survey paper
provides a comprehensive understanding of deep multi-modal learning for various
BL generations and recognitions for the first time. By analyzing advancements,
challenges, and future directions, it serves as a valuable resource for
researchers and practitioners in advancing this field. n addition, we maintain
a continuously updated paper list for deep multi-modal learning for BL
recognition and generation: https://github.com/wentaoL86/awesome-body-language.

<p class="mathjax">Speech phase prediction, which is a significant research focus in the field
of signal processing, aims to recover speech phase spectra from
amplitude-related features. However, existing speech phase prediction methods
are constrained to recovering phase spectra with short frame shifts, which are
considerably smaller than the theoretical upper bound required for exact
waveform reconstruction of short-time Fourier transform (STFT). To tackle this
issue, we present a novel long-frame-shift neural speech phase prediction
(LFS-NSPP) method which enables precise prediction of long-frame-shift phase
spectra from long-frame-shift log amplitude spectra. The proposed method
consists of three stages: interpolation, prediction and decimation. The
short-frame-shift log amplitude spectra are first constructed from
long-frame-shift ones through frequency-by-frequency interpolation to enhance
the spectral continuity, and then employed to predict short-frame-shift phase
spectra using an NSPP model, thereby compensating for interpolation errors.
Ultimately, the long-frame-shift phase spectra are obtained from
short-frame-shift ones through frame-by-frame decimation. Experimental results
show that the proposed LFS-NSPP method can yield superior quality in predicting
long-frame-shift phase spectra than the original NSPP model and other
signal-processing-based phase estimation algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Clinical classification of chest radiography is particularly challenging for
standard machine learning algorithms due to its inherent long-tailed and
multi-label nature. However, few attempts take into account the coupled
challenges posed by both the class imbalance and label co-occurrence, which
hinders their value to boost the diagnosis on chest X-rays (CXRs) in the
real-world scenarios. Besides, with the prevalence of pretraining techniques,
how to incorporate these new paradigms into the current framework lacks of the
systematical study. This technical report presents a brief description of our
solution in the ICCV CVAMD 2023 CXR-LT Competition. We empirically explored the
effectiveness for CXR diagnosis with the integration of several advanced
designs about data augmentation, feature extractor, classifier design, loss
function reweighting, exogenous data replenishment, etc. In addition, we
improve the performance through simple test-time data augmentation and
ensemble. Our framework finally achieves 0.349 mAP on the competition test set,
ranking in the top five.

<p class="mathjax">To bridge the physical and virtual worlds for rapidly developed VR/AR
applications, the ability to realistically drive 3D full-body avatars is of
great significance. Although real-time body tracking with only the head-mounted
displays (HMDs) and hand controllers is heavily under-constrained, a carefully
designed end-to-end neural network is of great potential to solve the problem
by learning from large-scale motion data. To this end, we propose a two-stage
framework that can obtain accurate and smooth full-body motions with the three
tracking signals of head and hands only. Our framework explicitly models the
joint-level features in the first stage and utilizes them as spatiotemporal
tokens for alternating spatial and temporal transformer blocks to capture
joint-level correlations in the second stage. Furthermore, we design a set of
loss terms to constrain the task of a high degree of freedom, such that we can
exploit the potential of our joint-level modeling. With extensive experiments
on the AMASS motion dataset and real-captured data, we validate the
effectiveness of our designs and show our proposed method can achieve more
accurate and smooth motion compared to existing approaches.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel framework for RGB-based category-level 6D object pose and
size estimation. Our approach relies on the prediction of normalized object
coordinate space (NOCS), which serves as an efficient and effective object
canonical representation that can be extracted from RGB images. Unlike previous
approaches that heavily relied on additional depth readings as input, our
novelty lies in leveraging multi-view information, which is commonly available
in practical scenarios where a moving camera continuously observes the
environment. By introducing multi-view constraints, we can obtain accurate
camera pose and depth estimation from a monocular dense SLAM framework.
Additionally, by incorporating constraints on the camera relative pose, we can
apply trimming strategies and robust pose averaging on the multi-view object
poses, resulting in more accurate and robust estimations of category-level
object poses even in the absence of direct depth readings. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel NOCS prediction network that significantly improves
performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our
proposed method, even comparable to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods across
public dataset sequences. Additionally, we showcase the generalization ability
of our method by evaluating it on self-collected datasets.

metaverse, intelligent healthcare, and self-driving simulation. But creating
them on a large scale with high levels of realism remains a challenge. The
utilization of deep implicit function sparks a new era of image-based 3D
clothed human reconstruction, enabling pixel-aligned shape recovery with fine
details. Subsequently, the vast majority of works locate the surface by
regressing the deterministic implicit value for each point. However, should all
points be treated equally regardless of their proximity to the surface? In this
paper, we propose replacing the implicit value with an adaptive uncertainty
distribution, to differentiate between points based on their distance to the
surface. This simple ``value to distribution'' transition yields significant
improvements on nearly all the baselines. Furthermore, qualitative results
demonstrate that the models trained using our uncertainty distribution loss,
can capture more intricate wrinkles, and realistic limbs. Code and models are
available for research purposes at https://github.com/psyai-net/D-IF_release.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of two-player zero-sum Markov games has recently attracted
increasing interests in theoretical studies of multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL). In particular, for finite-horizon episodic Markov decision
processes (MDPs), it has been shown that model-based algorithms can find an
$\epsilon$-optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) with the sample complexity of
$O(H^3SAB/\epsilon^2)$, which is optimal in the dependence of the horizon $H$
and the number of states $S$ (where $A$ and $B$ denote the number of actions of
the two players, respectively). However, none of the existing model-free
algorithms can achieve such an optimality. In this work, we propose a
model-free stage-based Q-learning algorithm and show that it achieves the same
sample complexity as the best model-based algorithm, and hence for the first
time demonstrate that model-free algorithms can enjoy the same optimality in
the $H$ dependence as model-based algorithms. The main improvement of the
dependency on $H$ arises by leveraging the popular variance reduction technique
based on the reference-advantage decomposition previously used only for
single-agent RL. However, such a technique relies on a critical monotonicity
property of the value function, which does not hold in Markov games due to the
update of the policy via the coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) oracle. Thus,
to extend such a technique to Markov games, our algorithm features a key novel
design of updating the reference value functions as the pair of optimistic and
pessimistic value functions whose value difference is the smallest in the
history in order to achieve the desired improvement in the sample efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">The wide adoption of social media platforms has brought about numerous
benefits for communication and information sharing. However, it has also led to
the rapid spread of misinformation, causing significant harm to individuals,
communities, and society at large. Consequently, there has been a growing
interest in devising efficient and effective strategies to contain the spread
of misinformation. One popular countermeasure is blocking edges in the
underlying network.
<br />We model the spread of misinformation using the classical Independent Cascade
model and study the problem of minimizing the spread by blocking a given number
of edges. We prove that this problem is computationally hard, but we propose an
intuitive community-based algorithm, which aims to detect well-connected
communities in the network and disconnect the inter-community edges. Our
experiments on various real-world social networks demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm significantly outperforms the prior methods, which mostly rely on
centrality measures.

<p class="mathjax">Collaboration is one of the most important factors in multi-robot systems.
Considering certain real-world applications and to further promote its
development, we propose a new benchmark to evaluate multi-robot collaboration
in Target Trapping Environment (T2E). In T2E, two kinds of robots (called
captor robot and target robot) share the same space. The captors aim to catch
the target collaboratively, while the target will try to escape from the trap.
Both the trapping and escaping process can use the environment layout to help
achieve the corresponding objective, which requires high collaboration between
robots and the utilization of the environment. For the benchmark, we present
and evaluate multiple learning-based baselines in T2E, and provide insights
into regimes of multi-robot collaboration. We also make our benchmark publicly
available and encourage researchers from related robotics disciplines to
propose, evaluate, and compare their solutions in this benchmark. Our project
is released at https://github.com/Dr-Xiaogaren/T2E.

<p class="mathjax">The stripe noise existing in remote sensing images badly degrades the visual
quality and restricts the precision of data analysis. Therefore, many
destriping models have been proposed in recent years. In contrast to these
existing models, in this paper, we propose a nonconvex model with a DC function
(i.e., the difference of convex functions) structure to remove the strip noise.
To solve this model, we make use of the DC structure and apply an inexact
proximal majorization-minimization algorithm with each inner subproblem solved
by the alternating direction method of multipliers. It deserves mentioning that
we design an implementable stopping criterion for the inner subproblem, while
the convergence can still be guaranteed. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed model and algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">We show that the VC-dimension of a graph can be computed in time $n^{\log
d+1} d^{O(d)}$, where $d$ is the degeneracy of the input graph. The core idea
of our algorithm is a data structure to efficiently query the number of
vertices that see a specific subset of vertices inside of a (small) query set.
The construction of this data structure takes time $O(d2^dn)$, afterwards
queries can be computed efficiently using fast M\"obius inversion.
<br />This data structure turns out to be useful for a range of tasks, especially
for finding bipartite patterns in degenerate graphs, and we outline an
efficient algorithms for counting the number of times specific patterns occur
in a graph. The largest factor in the running time of this algorithm is
$O(n^c)$, where $c$ is a parameter of the pattern we call its left covering
number.
<br />Concrete applications of this algorithm include counting the number of
(non-induced) bicliques in linear time, the number of co-matchings in quadratic
time, as well as a constant-factor approximation of the ladder index in linear
time.
<br />Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with several implementations
and run experiments on more than 200 real-world datasets -- the largest of
which has 8 million edges -- where we obtain interesting insights into the
VC-dimension of real-world networks.

<p class="mathjax">We study the computational complexity of fairly allocating a set of
indivisible items under externalities. In this recently-proposed setting, in
addition to the utility the agent gets from their bundle, they also receive
utility from items allocated to other agents. We focus on the extended
definitions of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and of envy-freeness up to
any item (EFX), and we provide the landscape of their complexity for several
different scenarios. We prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether there
exists an EFX allocation, even when there are only three agents, or even when
there are only six different values for the items. We complement these negative
results by showing that when both the number of agents and the number of
different values for items are bounded by a parameter the problem becomes
fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, we prove that two-valued and
binary-valued instances are equivalent and that EFX and EF1 allocations
coincide for this class of instances. Finally, motivated from real-life
scenarios, we focus on a class of structured valuation functions, which we term
agent/item-correlated. We prove their equivalence to the ``standard'' setting
without externalities. Therefore, all previous results for EF1 and EFX apply
immediately for these valuations.

<p class="mathjax">Algebraic techniques have had an important impact on graph algorithms so far.
Porting them, e.g., the matrix inverse, into the dynamic regime improved
best-known bounds for various dynamic graph problems. In this paper, we develop
new algorithms for another cornerstone algebraic primitive, the Frobenius
normal form (FNF). We apply our developments to dynamic and fault-tolerant
exact distance oracle problems on directed graphs.
<br />For generic matrices $A$ over a finite field accompanied by an FNF, we show
(1) an efficient data structure for querying submatrices of the first $k\geq 1$
powers of $A$, and (2) a near-optimal algorithm updating the FNF explicitly
under rank-1 updates.
<br />By representing an unweighted digraph using a generic matrix over a
sufficiently large field (obtained by random sampling) and leveraging the
developed FNF toolbox, we obtain: (a) a conditionally optimal distance
sensitivity oracle (DSO) in the case of single-edge or single-vertex failures,
providing a partial answer to the open question of Gu and Ren [ICALP'21], (b) a
multiple-failures DSO improving upon the state of the art (vd. Brand and
Saranurak [FOCS'19]) wrt. both preprocessing and query time, (c) improved
dynamic distance oracles in the case of single-edge updates, and (d) a dynamic
distance oracle supporting vertex updates, i.e., changing all edges incident to
a single vertex, in $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ worst-case time and distance queries in
$\tilde{O}(n)$ time.

<p class="mathjax">Cycle consistency has long been exploited as a powerful prior for jointly
optimizing maps within a collection of shapes. In this paper, we investigate
its utility in the approaches of Deep Functional Maps, which are considered
state-of-the-art in non-rigid shape matching. We first justify that under
certain conditions, the learned maps, when represented in the spectral domain,
are already cycle consistent. Furthermore, we identify the discrepancy that
spectrally consistent maps are not necessarily spatially, or point-wise,
consistent. In light of this, we present a novel design of unsupervised Deep
Functional Maps, which effectively enforces the harmony of learned maps under
the spectral and the point-wise representation. By taking advantage of cycle
consistency, our framework produces state-of-the-art results in mapping shapes
even under significant distortions. Beyond that, by independently estimating
maps in both spectral and spatial domains, our method naturally alleviates
over-fitting in network training, yielding superior generalization performance
and accuracy within an array of challenging tests for both near-isometric and
non-isometric datasets. Codes are available at
https://github.com/rqhuang88/Spatiallyand-Spectrally-Consistent-Deep-Functional-Maps.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised learning (SSL) tackles the label missing problem by enabling
the effective usage of unlabeled data. While existing SSL methods focus on the
traditional setting, a practical and challenging scenario called label Missing
Not At Random (MNAR) is usually ignored. In MNAR, the labeled and unlabeled
data fall into different class distributions resulting in biased label
imputation, which deteriorates the performance of SSL models. In this work,
class transition tracking based Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) is devised for
MNAR. We explore the class-level guidance information obtained by the Markov
random walk, which is modeled on a dynamically created graph built over the
class tracking matrix. PRG unifies the historical information of class
distribution and class transitions caused by the pseudo-rectifying procedure to
maintain the model's unbiased enthusiasm towards assigning pseudo-labels to all
classes, so as the quality of pseudo-labels on both popular classes and rare
classes in MNAR could be improved. Finally, we show the superior performance of
PRG across a variety of MNAR scenarios, outperforming the latest SSL approaches
combining bias removal solutions by a large margin. Code and model weights are

<p class="mathjax">In this work, a new data-free framework called Feature Enforcing Physics
Informed Neural Network (FE-PINN) is introduced. This framework is capable of
learning the underlying pattern of any problem with low computational cost
before the main training loop. The loss function of vanilla PINN due to the
existence of two terms of partial differential residuals and boundary condition
mean squared error is imbalanced. FE-PINN solves this challenge with just one
minute of training instead of time-consuming hyperparameter tuning for loss
function that can take hours. The FE-PINN accomplishes this process by
performing a sequence of sub-tasks. The first sub-task learns useful features
about the underlying physics. Then, the model trains on the target task to
refine the calculations. FE-PINN is applied to three benchmarks, flow over a
cylinder, 2D heat conduction, and an inverse problem of calculating inlet
velocity. FE-PINN can solve each case with, 15x, 2x, and 5x speed up
accordingly. Another advantage of FE-PINN is that reaching lower order of value
for loss function is systematically possible. In this study, it was possible to
reach a loss value near 1e-5 which is challenging for vanilla PINN. FE-PINN
also has a smooth convergence process which allows for utilizing higher
learning rates in comparison to vanilla PINN. This framework can be used as a
fast, accurate tool for solving a wide range of Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) across various fields.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the fact that input distributions are often unknown in advance,
distribution-free property testing considers a setting in which the algorithmic
task is to accept functions $f : [n] \to \{0,1\}$ having a certain property
$\Pi$ and reject functions that are $\epsilon$-far from $\Pi$, where the
distance is measured according to an arbitrary and unknown input distribution
$D \sim [n]$. As usual in property testing, the tester is required to do so
while making only a sublinear number of input queries, but as the distribution
is unknown, we also allow a sublinear number of samples from the distribution

<br />In this work we initiate the study of distribution-free interactive proofs of
proximity (df-IPP) in which the distribution-free testing algorithm is assisted
by an all powerful but untrusted prover. Our main result is a df-IPP for any
problem $\Pi \in NC$, with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ communication, sample, query,
and verification complexities, for any proximity parameter
$\epsilon&gt;1/\sqrt{n}$. For such proximity parameters, this result matches the
parameters of the best-known general purpose IPPs in the standard uniform
setting, and is optimal under reasonable cryptographic assumptions.
<br />For general values of the proximity parameter $\epsilon$, our
distribution-free IPP has optimal query complexity $O(1/\epsilon)$ but the
communication complexity is $\tilde{O}(\epsilon \cdot n + 1/\epsilon)$, which
is worse than what is known for uniform IPPs when $\epsilon&lt;1/\sqrt{n}$. With
the aim of improving on this gap, we further show that for IPPs over
specialised, but large distribution families, such as sufficiently smooth
distributions and product distributions, the communication complexity can be
reduced to $\epsilon\cdot n\cdot(1/\epsilon)^{o(1)}$ (keeping the query
complexity roughly the same as before) to match the communication complexity of
the uniform case.

<p class="mathjax">Visual storytelling aims to generate a narrative based on a sequence of
images, necessitating both vision-language alignment and coherent story
generation. Most existing solutions predominantly depend on paired image-text
training data, which can be costly to collect and challenging to scale. To
address this, we formulate visual storytelling as a visual-conditioned story
generation problem and propose a text-only training method that separates the
learning of cross-modality alignment and story generation. Our approach
specifically leverages the cross-modality pre-trained CLIP model to integrate
visual control into a story generator, trained exclusively on text data.
Moreover, we devise a training-free visual condition planner that accounts for
the temporal structure of the input image sequence while balancing global and
local visual content. The distinctive advantage of requiring only text data for
training enables our method to learn from external text story data, enhancing
the generalization capability of visual storytelling. We conduct extensive
experiments on the VIST benchmark, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Further evaluations on expression
diversity and human assessment underscore the superiority of our method in
terms of informativeness and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of enabling the coexistence of heterogeneous services, e.g.,
different ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) services and/or
enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services, in the uplink is studied. Each
service has its own error probability and blocklength constraints and the
longer transmission block suffers from heterogeneous interference. Due to the
latency concern, the decoding of URLLC messages cannot leverage successive
interference cancellation (SIC) and should always be performed before the
decoding of eMBB messages. This can significantly degrade the achievable rates
of URLLC users when the interference from other users is strong. To overcome
this issue, we propose a new transmission scheme based on discrete signaling
and treating interference as noise decoding, i.e., without SIC. Guided by the
deterministic model, we provide a systematic way to construct discrete
signaling for handling heterogeneous interference effectively. We demonstrate
theoretically and numerically that the proposed scheme can perform close to the
benchmark scheme based on capacity-achieving Gaussian signaling with the
assumption of perfect SIC.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the prevalence of scale variance in nature images, we propose to use
image scale as a self-supervised signal for Masked Image Modeling (MIM). Our
method involves selecting random patches from the input image and downsampling
them to a low-resolution format. Our framework utilizes the latest advances in
super-resolution (SR) to design the prediction head, which reconstructs the
input from low-resolution clues and other patches. After 400 epochs of
pre-training, our Super Resolution Masked Autoencoders (SRMAE) get an accuracy
of 82.1% on the ImageNet-1K task. Image scale signal also allows our SRMAE to
capture scale invariance representation. For the very low resolution (VLR)
recognition task, our model achieves the best performance, surpassing DeriveNet
by 1.3%. Our method also achieves an accuracy of 74.84% on the task of
recognizing low-resolution facial expressions, surpassing the current
state-of-the-art FMD by 9.48%.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we focus on the task of procedure planning from instructional
videos with text supervision, where a model aims to predict an action sequence
to transform the initial visual state into the goal visual state. A critical
challenge of this task is the large semantic gap between observed visual states
and unobserved intermediate actions, which is ignored by previous works.
Specifically, this semantic gap refers to that the contents in the observed
visual states are semantically different from the elements of some action text
labels in a procedure. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose a novel
event-guided paradigm, which first infers events from the observed states and
then plans out actions based on both the states and predicted events. Our
inspiration comes from that planning a procedure from an instructional video is
to complete a specific event and a specific event usually involves specific
actions. Based on the proposed paradigm, we contribute an Event-guided
Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) model, which encodes event information
into the sequential modeling process to support procedure planning. To further
consider the strong action associations within each event, our E3P adopts a
mask-and-predict approach for relation mining, incorporating a probabilistic
masking scheme for regularization. Extensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

structure of deep learning objectives, namely, the composition of a convex loss
function and of a nonlinear network, in order to derive better direction
oracles than stochastic gradients, based on the idea of partial linearization.
In a departure from previous works, we propose to compute such direction
oracles via their dual formulation, leading to both computational benefits and
new insights. We demonstrate that the resulting oracles define descent
directions that can be used as a drop-in replacement for stochastic gradients,

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims to learn a domain-generalizable (DG) person re-identification
(ReID) representation from large-scale videos \textbf{without any annotation}.
Prior DG ReID methods employ limited labeled data for training due to the high
cost of annotation, which restricts further advances. To overcome the barriers
of data and annotation, we propose to utilize large-scale unsupervised data for
training. The key issue lies in how to mine identity information. To this end,
we propose an Identity-seeking Self-supervised Representation learning (ISR)
method. ISR constructs positive pairs from inter-frame images by modeling the
instance association as a maximum-weight bipartite matching problem. A
reliability-guided contrastive loss is further presented to suppress the
adverse impact of noisy positive pairs, ensuring that reliable positive pairs
dominate the learning process. The training cost of ISR scales approximately
linearly with the data size, making it feasible to utilize large-scale data for
training. The learned representation exhibits superior generalization ability.
\textbf{Without human annotation and fine-tuning, ISR achieves 87.0\% Rank-1 on
Market-1501 and 56.4\% Rank-1 on MSMT17}, outperforming the best supervised
domain-generalizable method by 5.0\% and 19.5\%, respectively. In the
pre-training$\rightarrow$fine-tuning scenario, ISR achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 88.4\% Rank-1 on MSMT17. The code is at

<p class="mathjax">Damped wave equations have been used in many real-world fields. In this
paper, we study a low-rank solution of the strongly damped wave equation with
the damping term, visco-elastic damping term and mass term. Firstly, a
second-order finite difference method is employed for spatial discretization.
Then, we receive a second-order matrix differential system. Next, we transform
it into an equivalent first-order matrix differential system, and split the
transformed system into three subproblems. Applying a Strang splitting to these
subproblems and combining a dynamical low-rank approach, we obtain a low-rank
algorithm. Numerical experiments are reported to demonstrate that the proposed
low-rank algorithm is robust and accurate, and has second-order convergence
rate in time.

<p class="mathjax">Split learning (SL) has emerged as a promising approach for model training
without revealing the raw data samples from the data owners. However,
traditional SL inevitably leaks label privacy as the tail model (with the last
layers) should be placed on the server. To overcome this limitation, one
promising solution is to utilize U-shaped architecture to leave both early
layers and last layers on the user side. In this paper, we develop a novel
parallel U-shaped split learning and devise the optimal resource optimization
scheme to improve the performance of edge networks. In the proposed framework,
multiple users communicate with an edge server for SL. We analyze the
end-to-end delay of each client during the training process and design an
efficient resource allocation algorithm, called LSCRA, which finds the optimal
computing resource allocation and split layers. Our experimental results show
the effectiveness of LSCRA and that U-shaped PSL can achieve a similar
performance with other SL baselines while preserving label privacy. Index

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of allocating divisible resources among $n$ agents,
hopefully in a fair and efficient manner. With the presence of strategic
agents, additional incentive guarantees are also necessary, and the problem of
designing fair and efficient mechanisms becomes much less tractable. While the
maximum Nash welfare (MNW) mechanism has been proven to be prominent by
providing desirable fairness and efficiency guarantees as well as other
intuitive properties, no incentive property is known for it.
<br />We show a surprising result that, when agents have piecewise constant value
density functions, the incentive ratio of the MNW mechanism is $2$ for cake
cutting, where the incentive ratio of a mechanism is defined as the ratio
between the largest possible utility that an agent can gain by manipulation and
his utility in honest behavior. Remarkably, this result holds even without the
free disposal assumption, which is hard to get rid of in the design of truthful
cake cutting mechanisms. We also show that the MNW mechanism is group
strategyproof when agents have piecewise uniform value density functions.
<br />Moreover, we show that, for cake cutting, the Partial Allocation (PA)
mechanism proposed by Cole et al., which is truthful and $1/e$-MNW for
homogeneous divisible items, has an incentive ratio between $[e^{1 / e}, e]$
and when randomization is allowed, can be turned to be truthful in expectation.
Given two alternatives for a trade-off between incentive ratio and Nash welfare
provided by the MNW and PA mechanisms, we establish an interpolation between
them for both cake cutting and homogeneous divisible items.
<br />Finally, we study the existence of fair mechanisms with a low incentive ratio
in the connected pieces setting. We show that any envy-free cake cutting
mechanism with the connected pieces constraint has an incentive ratio of at
least $\Omega(n)$.

<p class="mathjax">Pain is a complex concept that can interconnect with other concepts such as a
disorder that might cause pain, a medication that might relieve pain, and so
on. To fully understand the context of pain experienced by either an individual
or across a population, we may need to examine all concepts related to pain and
the relationships between them. This is especially useful when modeling pain
that has been recorded in electronic health records. Knowledge graphs represent
concepts and their relations by an interlinked network, enabling semantic and
context-based reasoning in a computationally tractable form. These graphs can,
however, be too large for efficient computation. Knowledge graph embeddings
help to resolve this by representing the graphs in a low-dimensional vector
space. These embeddings can then be used in various downstream tasks such as
classification and link prediction. The various relations associated with pain
which are required to construct such a knowledge graph can be obtained from
external medical knowledge bases such as SNOMED CT, a hierarchical systematic
nomenclature of medical terms. A knowledge graph built in this way could be
further enriched with real-world examples of pain and its relations extracted
from electronic health records. This paper describes the construction of such
knowledge graph embedding models of pain concepts, extracted from the
unstructured text of mental health electronic health records, combined with
external knowledge created from relations described in SNOMED CT, and their
evaluation on a subject-object link prediction task. The performance of the
models was compared with other baseline models.

<p class="mathjax">Malware detectors based on deep learning (DL) have been shown to be
susceptible to malware examples that have been deliberately manipulated in
order to evade detection, a.k.a. adversarial malware examples. More
specifically, it has been show that deep learning detectors are vulnerable to
small changes on the input file. Given this vulnerability of deep learning
detectors, we propose a practical defense against adversarial malware examples
inspired by randomized smoothing. In our work, instead of employing Gaussian or
Laplace noise when randomizing inputs, we propose a randomized ablation-based
smoothing scheme that ablates a percentage of the bytes within an executable.
During training, our randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base
classifier based on ablated versions of the executable files. At test time, the
final classification for a given input executable is taken as the class most
commonly predicted by the classifier on a set of ablated versions of the
original executable. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have
empirically evaluated the proposed ablation-based model against various
state-of-the-art evasion attacks on the BODMAS dataset. Results show greater
robustness and generalization capabilities to adversarial malware examples in
comparison to a non-smoothed classifier.

<p class="mathjax">Research on conversational search has so far mostly focused on query
rewriting and multi-stage passage retrieval. However, synthesizing the top
retrieved passages into a complete, relevant, and concise response is still an
open challenge. Having snippet-level annotations of relevant passages would
enable both (1) the training of response generation models that are able to
ground answers in actual statements and (2) the automatic evaluation of the
generated responses in terms of completeness. In this paper, we address the
problem of collecting high-quality snippet-level answer annotations for two of
the TREC Conversational Assistance track datasets. To ensure quality, we first
perform a preliminary annotation study, employing different task designs,
crowdsourcing platforms, and workers with different qualifications. Based on
the outcomes of this study, we refine our annotation protocol before proceeding
with the full-scale data collection. Overall, we gather annotations for 1.8k
question-paragraph pairs, each annotated by three independent crowd workers.
The process of collecting data at this magnitude also led to multiple insights
about the problem that can inform the design of future response-generation
methods. This is an extended version of the article published with the same
title in the Proceedings of CIKM'23.

<p class="mathjax">Massive key performance indicators (KPIs) are monitored as multivariate time
series data (MTS) to ensure the reliability of the software applications and
service system. Accurately detecting the abnormality of MTS is very critical
for subsequent fault elimination. The scarcity of anomalies and manual labeling
has led to the development of various self-supervised MTS anomaly detection
(AD) methods, which optimize an overall objective/loss encompassing all
metrics' regression objectives/losses. However, our empirical study uncovers
the prevalence of conflicts among metrics' regression objectives, causing MTS
models to grapple with different losses. This critical aspect significantly
impacts detection performance but has been overlooked in existing approaches.
To address this problem, by mimicking the design of multi-gate
mixture-of-experts (MMoE), we introduce CAD, a Conflict-aware multivariate KPI
Anomaly Detection algorithm. CAD offers an exclusive structure for each metric
to mitigate potential conflicts while fostering inter-metric promotions. Upon
thorough investigation, we find that the poor performance of vanilla MMoE
mainly comes from the input-output misalignment settings of MTS formulation and
convergence issues arising from expansive tasks. To address these challenges,
we propose a straightforward yet effective task-oriented metric selection and
p&amp;s (personalized and shared) gating mechanism, which establishes CAD as the
first practicable multi-task learning (MTL) based MTS AD model. Evaluations on
multiple public datasets reveal that CAD obtains an average F1-score of 0.943
across three public datasets, notably outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a Joint Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection (JED)
scheme for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless communication
systems. Our proposed method for JED using Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (JED-ADMM) and its model-based neural network version JED using
Unfolded ADMM (JED-U-ADMM) markedly improve the symbol detection performance
over JED using Alternating Minimization (JED-AM) for a range of MIMO antenna
configurations. Both proposed algorithms exploit the non-smooth constraint,
that occurs as a result of the Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) data
symbols, to effectively improve the performance using the ADMM iterations. The
proposed unfolded network JED-U-ADMM consists of a few trainable parameters and
requires a small training set. We show the efficacy of the proposed methods for
both uncorrelated and correlated MIMO channels. For certain configurations, the
gain in SNR for a desired BER of $10^{-2}$ for the proposed JED-ADMM and
JED-U-ADMM is upto $4$ dB and is also accompanied by a significant reduction in
computational complexity of upto $75\%$, depending on the MIMO configuration,
as compared to the complexity of JED-AM.

<p class="mathjax">Market making (MM) has attracted significant attention in financial trading
owing to its essential function in ensuring market liquidity. With strong
capabilities in sequential decision-making, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
technology has achieved remarkable success in quantitative trading.
Nonetheless, most existing RL-based MM methods focus on optimizing single-price
level strategies which fail at frequent order cancellations and loss of queue
priority. Strategies involving multiple price levels align better with actual
trading scenarios. However, given the complexity that multi-price level
strategies involves a comprehensive trading action space, the challenge of
effectively training profitable RL agents for MM persists. Inspired by the
efficient workflow of professional human market makers, we propose Imitative
Market Maker (IMM), a novel RL framework leveraging both knowledge from
suboptimal signal-based experts and direct policy interactions to develop
multi-price level MM strategies efficiently. The framework start with
introducing effective state and action representations adept at encoding
information about multi-price level orders. Furthermore, IMM integrates a
representation learning unit capable of capturing both short- and long-term
market trends to mitigate adverse selection risk. Subsequently, IMM formulates
an expert strategy based on signals and trains the agent through the
integration of RL and imitation learning techniques, leading to efficient
learning. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets
demonstrate that IMM outperforms current RL-based market making strategies in
terms of several financial criteria. The findings of the ablation study
substantiate the effectiveness of the model components.

<p class="mathjax">Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to accurately detect objects hidden
in the surrounding environment. However, the existing COD methods mainly locate
camouflaged objects in the RGB domain, their performance has not been fully
exploited in many challenging scenarios. Considering that the features of the
camouflaged object and the background are more discriminative in the frequency
domain, we propose a novel learnable and separable frequency perception
mechanism driven by the semantic hierarchy in the frequency domain. Our entire
network adopts a two-stage model, including a frequency-guided coarse
localization stage and a detail-preserving fine localization stage. With the
multi-level features extracted by the backbone, we design a flexible frequency
perception module based on octave convolution for coarse positioning. Then, we
design the correction fusion module to step-by-step integrate the high-level
features through the prior-guided correction and cross-layer feature channel
association, and finally combine them with the shallow features to achieve the
detailed correction of the camouflaged objects. Compared with the currently
existing models, our proposed method achieves competitive performance in three
popular benchmark datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we tackle the challenge of white-box false positive
adversarial attacks on contrastive loss-based offline handwritten signature
verification models. We propose a novel attack method that treats the attack as
a style transfer between closely related but distinct writing styles. To guide
the generation of deceptive images, we introduce two new loss functions that
enhance the attack success rate by perturbing the Euclidean distance between
the embedding vectors of the original and synthesized samples, while ensuring
minimal perturbations by reducing the difference between the generated image
and the original image. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
white-box attacks on contrastive loss-based offline handwritten signature
verification models, as evidenced by our experiments. The key contributions of
this paper include a novel false positive attack method, two new loss
functions, effective style transfer in handwriting styles, and superior
performance in white-box false positive attacks compared to other white-box
attack methods.

<p class="mathjax">By integrating complementary information from RGB image and depth map, the
ability of salient object detection (SOD) for complex and challenging scenes
can be improved. In recent years, the important role of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) in feature extraction and cross-modality interaction has been
fully explored, but it is still insufficient in modeling global long-range
dependencies of self-modality and cross-modality. To this end, we introduce
CNNs-assisted Transformer architecture and propose a novel RGB-D SOD network
with Point-aware Interaction and CNN-induced Refinement (PICR-Net). On the one
hand, considering the prior correlation between RGB modality and depth
modality, an attention-triggered cross-modality point-aware interaction (CmPI)
module is designed to explore the feature interaction of different modalities
with positional constraints. On the other hand, in order to alleviate the block
effect and detail destruction problems brought by the Transformer naturally, we
design a CNN-induced refinement (CNNR) unit for content refinement and
supplementation. Extensive experiments on five RGB-D SOD datasets show that the
proposed network achieves competitive results in both quantitative and
qualitative comparisons.

<p class="mathjax">Revealing and analyzing the various properties of materials is an essential
and critical issue in the development of materials, including batteries,
semiconductors, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals. Traditionally, these properties
have been determined through theoretical calculations and simulations. However,
it is not practical to perform such calculations on every single candidate
material. Recently, a combination method of the theoretical calculation and
machine learning has emerged, that involves training machine learning models on
a subset of theoretical calculation results to construct a surrogate model that
can be applied to the remaining materials. On the other hand, a technique
called pre-training is used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models.
Pre-training involves training the model on pretext task, which is different
from the target task, before training the model on the target task. This
process aims to extract the input data features, stabilizing the learning
process and improving its accuracy. However, in the case of molecular property
prediction, there is a strong imbalance in the distribution of input data and
features, which may lead to biased learning towards frequently occurring data
during pre-training. In this study, we propose an effective pre-training method
that addresses the imbalance in input data. We aim to improve the final
accuracy by modifying the loss function of the existing representative
pre-training method, node masking, to compensate the imbalance. We have
investigated and assessed the impact of our proposed imbalance compensation on
pre-training and the final prediction accuracy through experiments and
evaluations using benchmark of molecular property prediction models.

<p class="mathjax">Despite significant progress in shadow detection, current methods still
struggle with the adverse impact of background color, which may lead to errors
when shadows are present on complex backgrounds. Drawing inspiration from the
human visual system, we treat the input shadow image as a composition of a
background layer and a shadow layer, and design a Style-guided Dual-layer
Disentanglement Network (SDDNet) to model these layers independently. To
achieve this, we devise a Feature Separation and Recombination (FSR) module
that decomposes multi-level features into shadow-related and background-related
components by offering specialized supervision for each component, while
preserving information integrity and avoiding redundancy through the
reconstruction constraint. Moreover, we propose a Shadow Style Filter (SSF)
module to guide the feature disentanglement by focusing on style
differentiation and uniformization. With these two modules and our overall
pipeline, our model effectively minimizes the detrimental effects of background
color, yielding superior performance on three public datasets with a real-time
inference speed of 32 FPS.

models, mostly involving Computational fluid dynamics(CFD) and Celluar
Automata, but these methods have always been computationally expensive and
difficult to deliver a fast decision pattern. In this paper, we provide machine
learning based approaches that solve the problem of high computational effort
and time consumption. This paper predicts the burning duration of a known
wildfire by RF(random forest), KNN, and XGBoost regression models and also
image-based, like CNN and Encoder. Model inputs are based on the map of
landscape features provided by satellites and the corresponding historical fire
data in this area. This model is trained by happened fire data and landform
feature maps and tested with the most recent real value in the same area. By
processing the input differently to obtain the optimal outcome, the system is
able to make fast and relatively accurate future predictions based on landscape
images of known fires.

<p class="mathjax">As responsible AI gains importance in machine learning algorithms, properties
such as fairness, adversarial robustness, and causality have received
considerable attention in recent years. However, despite their individual
significance, there remains a critical gap in simultaneously exploring and
integrating these properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
examines the relationship between individual fairness, adversarial robustness,
and structural causal models in heterogeneous data spaces, particularly when
dealing with discrete sensitive attributes. We use causal structural models and
sensitive attributes to create a fair metric and apply it to measure semantic
similarity among individuals. By introducing a novel causal adversarial
perturbation and applying adversarial training, we create a new regularizer
that combines individual fairness, causality, and robustness in the classifier.
Our method is evaluated on both real-world and synthetic datasets,
demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving an accurate classifier that
simultaneously exhibits fairness, adversarial robustness, and causal awareness.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we reflect on the educational challenges and research
opportunities in running data visualization design activities in the context of
large courses. With the increasing number and sizes of data visualization
course, we need to better understand approaches to scaling our teaching
efforts. We draw on experiences organizing and facilitating activities
primarily based on one instance of a master's course given to about 130
students. We provide a detailed account of the course with particular focus on
the purpose, structure, and outcome of six two-hour design activities. Based on
this, we reflect on three aspects of the course: First, how the course scale
led us to thoroughly plan, evaluate, and revise communication between students,
teaching assistants, and lecturers. Second, how we designed learning scaffolds
through the design activities, and the reflections we received from students on
this matter. Finally, we reflect on the diversity of the students that followed
the course, the visualization exercises we used, the projects they worked on,
and when to key in on simple boring problems and data sets. Thus, our paper
contributes with discussions about balancing topical diversity, scaling courses
to many students, and problem-based learning.

<p class="mathjax">An essential requirement for driver assistance systems and autonomous driving
technology is implementing a robust system for detecting and recognizing
traffic signs. This system enables the vehicle to autonomously analyze the
environment and make appropriate decisions regarding its movement, even when
operating at higher frame rates. However, traffic sign images captured in
inadequate lighting and adverse weather conditions are poorly visible, blurred,
faded, and damaged. Consequently, the recognition of traffic signs in such
circumstances becomes inherently difficult. This paper addressed the challenges
of recognizing traffic signs from images captured in low light, noise, and
blurriness. To achieve this goal, a two-step methodology has been employed. The
first step involves enhancing traffic sign images by applying a modified MIRNet
model and producing enhanced images. In the second step, the Yolov4 model
recognizes the traffic signs in an unconstrained environment. The proposed
method has achieved 5.40% increment in mAP@0.5 for low quality images on
Yolov4. The overall mAP@0.5 of 96.75% has been achieved on the GTSRB dataset.
It has also attained mAP@0.5 of 100% on the GTSDB dataset for the broad
categories, comparable with the state-of-the-art work.

<p class="mathjax">Exploring spatial-temporal dependencies from observed motions is one of the
core challenges of human motion prediction. Previous methods mainly focus on
dedicated network structures to model the spatial and temporal dependencies.
This paper considers a new direction by introducing a model learning framework
with auxiliary tasks. In our auxiliary tasks, partial body joints' coordinates
are corrupted by either masking or adding noise and the goal is to recover
corrupted coordinates depending on the rest coordinates. To work with auxiliary
tasks, we propose a novel auxiliary-adapted transformer, which can handle
incomplete, corrupted motion data and achieve coordinate recovery via capturing
spatial-temporal dependencies. Through auxiliary tasks, the auxiliary-adapted
transformer is promoted to capture more comprehensive spatial-temporal
dependencies among body joints' coordinates, leading to better feature
learning. Extensive experimental results have shown that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins of 7.2%, 3.7%, and 9.4% in terms
of 3D mean per joint position error (MPJPE) on the Human3.6M, CMU Mocap, and
3DPW datasets, respectively. We also demonstrate that our method is more robust
under data missing cases and noisy data cases. Code is available at
https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/AuxFormer.

<p class="mathjax">Upon evolving their software, organizations and individual developers have to
spend a substantial effort to pay back technical debt, i.e., the fact that
software is released in a shape not as good as it should be, e.g., in terms of
functionality, reliability, or maintainability. This paper empirically
investigates the extent to which technical debt can be automatically paid back
by neural-based generative models, and in particular models exploiting
different strategies for pre-training and fine-tuning. We start by extracting a
dateset of 5,039 Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) removals from 595
open-source projects. SATD refers to technical debt instances documented (e.g.,
via code comments) by developers. We use this dataset to experiment with seven
different generative deep learning (DL) model configurations. Specifically, we
compare transformers pre-trained and fine-tuned with different combinations of
training objectives, including the fixing of generic code changes, SATD
removals, and SATD-comment prompt tuning. Also, we investigate the
applicability in this context of a recently-available Large Language Model
(LLM)-based chat bot. Results of our study indicate that the automated
repayment of SATD is a challenging task, with the best model we experimented
with able to automatically fix ~2% to 8% of test instances, depending on the
number of attempts it is allowed to make. Given the limited size of the
fine-tuning dataset (~5k instances), the model's pre-training plays a
fundamental role in boosting performance. Also, the ability to remove SATD
steadily drops if the comment documenting the SATD is not provided as input to
the model. Finally, we found general-purpose LLMs to not be a competitive
approach for addressing SATD.

<p class="mathjax">Data in tabular format is frequently occurring in real-world applications.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle
such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation
learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in
the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic
behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet
(Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the
learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how
the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A
large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is
performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target
tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time,
the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with
the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional
computational overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Denoising diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation and
editing. We present a method to localize the desired edit region implicit in a
text instruction. We leverage InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) and identify the
discrepancy between IP2P predictions with and without the instruction. This
discrepancy is referred to as the relevance map. The relevance map conveys the
importance of changing each pixel to achieve the edits, and is used to to guide
the modifications. This guidance ensures that the irrelevant pixels remain
unchanged. Relevance maps are further used to enhance the quality of
text-guided editing of 3D scenes in the form of neural radiance fields. A field
is trained on relevance maps of training views, denoted as the relevance field,
defining the 3D region within which modifications should be made. We perform
iterative updates on the training views guided by rendered relevance maps from
the relevance field. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image and NeRF editing tasks. Project page:

prediction that handles multiple input modalities with different temporal and
spatial resolutions. We use high-resolution crop yield maps as ground truth
data to train crop and machine learning model agnostic methods at the sub-field

data with other complementary modalities, including weather, soil, and DEM

making the framework globally scalable. We explicitly highlight the importance

<p class="mathjax">Feature attribution methods attempt to explain neural network predictions by
identifying relevant features. However, establishing a cohesive framework for
assessing feature attribution remains a challenge. There are several views
through which we can evaluate attributions. One principal lens is to observe
the effect of perturbing attributed features on the model's behavior (i.e.,
faithfulness). While providing useful insights, existing faithfulness
evaluations suffer from shortcomings that we reveal in this paper. In this
work, we propose two new perspectives within the faithfulness paradigm that
reveal intuitive properties: soundness and completeness. Soundness assesses the
degree to which attributed features are truly predictive features, while
completeness examines how well the resulting attribution reveals all the
predictive features. The two perspectives are based on a firm mathematical
foundation and provide quantitative metrics that are computable through
efficient algorithms. We apply these metrics to mainstream attribution methods,
offering a novel lens through which to analyze and compare feature attribution
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Gzip is a file compression format, which is ubiquitously used. Although a
multitude of gzip implementations exist, only pugz can fully utilize current
multi-core processor architectures for decompression. Yet, pugz cannot
decompress arbitrary gzip files. It requires the decompressed stream to only
contain byte values 9-126. In this work, we present a generalization of the
parallelization scheme used by pugz that can be reliably applied to arbitrary
gzip-compressed data without compromising performance. We show that the
requirements on the file contents posed by pugz can be dropped by implementing
an architecture based on a cache and a parallelized prefetcher. This
architecture can safely handle faulty decompression results, which can appear
when threads start decompressing in the middle of a gzip file by using trial
and error. Using 128 cores, our implementation reaches 8.7 GB/s decompression

<p class="mathjax">Feature tracking is a common task in visualization applications, where
methods based on topological data analysis (TDA) have successfully been applied
in the past for feature definition as well as tracking. In this work, we focus
on tracking extrema of temporal scalar fields. A family of TDA approaches
address this task by establishing one-to-one correspondences between extrema
based on discrete gradient vector fields. More specifically, two extrema of
subsequent time steps are matched if they fall into their respective ascending
and descending manifolds. However, due to this one-to-one assignment, these
approaches are prone to fail where, e.g., extrema are located in regions with
low gradient magnitude, or are located close to boundaries of the manifolds.
Therefore, we propose a probabilistic matching that captures a larger set of
possible correspondences via neighborhood sampling, or by computing the overlap
of the manifolds. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach with two
application cases.

<p class="mathjax">Computing a minimum path cover (MPC) of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a
fundamental problem with a myriad of applications, including reachability.
Although it is known how to solve the problem by a simple reduction to minimum
flow, recent theoretical advances exploit this idea to obtain algorithms
parameterized by the number of paths of an MPC, known as the width. These
results obtain fast [M\"akinen et al., TALG] and even linear time [C\'aceres et
al., SODA 2022] algorithms in the small-width regime.
<br />In this paper, we present the first publicly available high-performance
implementation of state-of-the-art MPC algorithms, including the parameterized
approaches. Our experiments on random DAGs show that parameterized algorithms
are orders-of-magnitude faster on dense graphs. Additionally, we present new
pre-processing heuristics based on transitive edge sparsification. We show that
our heuristics improve MPC-solvers by orders-of-magnitude.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, neural code translation has gained increasing attention.
While most of the research focuses on improving model architectures and
training processes, we notice that the evaluation process and benchmark for
code translation models are severely limited: they primarily treat source code
as natural languages and provide a holistic accuracy score while disregarding
the full spectrum of model capabilities across different translation types and
complexity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of four
state-of-the-art models and analyze in-depth the advantages and limitations of
three existing benchmarks. Based on the empirical results, we develop a
taxonomy that categorizes code translation tasks into four primary types
according to their complexity and knowledge dependence: token level (type 1),
syntactic level (type 2), library level (type 3), and algorithm level (type 4).
We then conduct a thorough analysis of how existing approaches perform across
these four categories. Our findings indicate that while state-of-the-art code
translation models excel in type-1 and type-2 translations, they struggle with
knowledge-dependent ones such as type-3 and type-4. Existing benchmarks are
biased towards trivial translations, such as keyword mapping. To overcome these
limitations, we construct G-TransEval, a new benchmark by manually curating
type-3 and type-4 translation pairs and unit test cases. Results on our new
benchmark suggest that G-TransEval can exhibit more comprehensive and
finer-grained capability of code translation models and thus provide a more
rigorous evaluation. Our studies also provide more insightful findings and
suggestions for future research, such as building type-3 and type-4 training
data and ensembling multiple pretraining approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive graph node clustering via learnable data augmentation is a hot
research spot in the field of unsupervised graph learning. The existing methods
learn the sampling distribution of a pre-defined augmentation to generate
data-driven augmentations automatically. Although promising clustering
performance has been achieved, we observe that these strategies still rely on
pre-defined augmentations, the semantics of the augmented graph can easily
drift. The reliability of the augmented view semantics for contrastive learning
can not be guaranteed, thus limiting the model performance. To address these
problems, we propose a novel CONtrastiVe Graph ClustEring network with Reliable
AugmenTation (COVERT). Specifically, in our method, the data augmentations are
processed by the proposed reversible perturb-recover network. It distills
reliable semantic information by recovering the perturbed latent embeddings.
Moreover, to further guarantee the reliability of semantics, a novel semantic
loss is presented to constrain the network via quantifying the perturbation and
recovery. Lastly, a label-matching mechanism is designed to guide the model by
clustering information through aligning the semantic labels and the selected
high-confidence clustering pseudo labels. Extensive experimental results on
seven datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We release
the code and appendix of CONVERT at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/CONVERT
on GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Nonlinearity is a central feature in demanding computing applications that
aim to deal with tasks such as optimization or classification. Furthermore, the
consensus is that nonlinearity should not be only exploited at the algorithm
level, but also at the physical level by finding devices that incorporate
desired nonlinear features to physically implement energy, area and/or time
efficient computing applications. Chaotic oscillators are one type of system
powered by nonlinearity, which can be used for computing purposes. In this work
we present a physical implementation of a tunable Chua's circuit in which the
nonlinear part is based on a nonvolatile memristive device. Device
characterization and circuit analysis serve as guidelines to design the circuit
and results prove the possibility to tune the circuit oscillatory response by
electrically programming the device.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed Machine Learning (ML) technique that
can benefit from cloud environments while preserving data privacy. We propose
Multi-FedLS, a framework that manages multi-cloud resources, reducing execution
time and financial costs of Cross-Silo Federated Learning applications by using
preemptible VMs, cheaper than on-demand ones but that can be revoked at any
time. Our framework encloses four modules: Pre-Scheduling, Initial Mapping,
Fault Tolerance, and Dynamic Scheduler. This paper extends our previous work
\cite{brum2022sbac} by formally describing the Multi-FedLS resource manager
framework and its modules. Experiments were conducted with three Cross-Silo FL
applications on CloudLab and a proof-of-concept confirms that Multi-FedLS can
be executed on a multi-cloud composed by AWS and GCP, two commercial cloud
providers. Results show that the problem of executing Cross-Silo FL
applications in multi-cloud environments with preemptible VMs can be
efficiently resolved using a mathematical formulation, fault tolerance
techniques, and a simple heuristic to choose a new VM in case of revocation.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a novel high-order numerical method designed for solving
the two-dimensional time-fractional convection-diffusion (TFCD) equation. The
Caputo definition is employed to characterize the time-fractional derivative. A
weak singularity at the initial time ($t=0$) is encountered in the considered
problem, which is effectively managed by adopting a discretization approach for
the time-fractional derivative, where Alikhanov's high-order L2-1$_\sigma$
formula is applied on a non-uniform fitted mesh, resulting in successful
tackling of the singularity. A high-order two-dimensional compact operator is
implemented to approximate the spatial variables. The alternating direction
implicit (ADI) approach is then employed to solve the resulting system of
equations by decomposing the two-dimensional problem into two separate
one-dimensional problems. The theoretical analysis, encompassing both stability
and convergence aspects, has been conducted comprehensively, and it has shown
that method is convergent with an order $\mathcal
O\left(N_t^{-\min\{3-\alpha,\theta\alpha,1+2\alpha,2+\alpha\}}+h_x^4+h_y^4\right)$,
where $\alpha\in(0,1)$ represents the order of the fractional derivative, $N_t$
is the temporal discretization parameter and $h_x$ and $h_y$ represent spatial
mesh widths. Moreover, the parameter $\theta$ is utilized in the construction
of the fitted mesh.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-hop QA involves finding multiple relevant passages and step-by-step
reasoning to answer complex questions. While previous approaches have developed
retrieval modules for selecting relevant passages, they face challenges in
scenarios beyond two hops, owing to the limited performance of one-step methods
and the failure of two-step methods when selecting irrelevant passages in
earlier stages. In this work, we introduce Beam Retrieval, a general end-to-end
retrieval framework for multi-hop QA. This approach maintains multiple partial
hypotheses of relevant passages at each step, expanding the search space and
reducing the risk of missing relevant passages. Moreover, Beam Retrieval
jointly optimizes an encoder and two classification heads by minimizing the
combined loss across all hops. To establish a complete QA system, we
incorporate a supervised reader or a zero-shot GPT-3.5. Experimental results
demonstrate that Beam Retrieval achieves a nearly 50% improvement compared with
baselines on challenging MuSiQue-Ans, and it also surpasses all previous
retrievers on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA. Providing high-quality context,
Beam Retrieval helps our supervised reader achieve new state-of-the-art
performance and substantially improves (up to 28.8 points) the QA performance
of zero-shot GPT-3.5.

<p class="mathjax">Biohybrid systems in which robotic lures interact with animals have become
compelling tools for probing and identifying the mechanisms underlying
collective animal behavior. One key challenge lies in the transfer of social
interaction models from simulations to reality, using robotics to validate the
modeling hypotheses. This challenge arises in bridging what we term the
"biomimicry gap", which is caused by imperfect robotic replicas, communication
cues and physics constrains not incorporated in the simulations that may elicit
unrealistic behavioral responses in animals. In this work, we used a biomimetic
lure of a rummy-nose tetra fish (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) and a neural network
(NN) model for generating biomimetic social interactions. Through experiments
with a biohybrid pair comprising a fish and the robotic lure, a pair of real
fish, and simulations of pairs of fish, we demonstrate that our biohybrid
system generates high-fidelity social interactions mirroring those of genuine
fish pairs. Our analyses highlight that: 1) the lure and NN maintain minimal
deviation in real-world interactions compared to simulations and fish-only
experiments, 2) our NN controls the robot efficiently in real-time, and 3) a
comprehensive validation is crucial to bridge the biomimicry gap, ensuring
realistic biohybrid systems.

<p class="mathjax">The Fourth Industrial Revolution, ushered by the deeper integration of
digital technologies into professional and social spaces, provides an
opportunity to meaningfully serve society. Humans have tremendous capability to
innovatively improve social well-being when the situation is clear. Which was
not the case during the first three revolutions. Thus, society has been
accepting lifestyle changes willingly and several negative consequences
unwillingly. Since the fourth one is still in its infancy, we can control it
better. This paper presents a unified model of the industrialized ecosystem
covering value creation, value consumption, enabling infrastructure, required
skills, and additional governance. This design thinking viewpoint, which
includes the consumer side of digital transformation, sets the stage for the
next major lifestyle change, termed Digital Transfiguration. For validation and
ease of comprehension, the model draws upon the well-understood automobile

<p class="mathjax">Although rarely stated, in practice, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC)
encompasses various models with distinct objectives, ranging from grammatical
error detection to improving fluency. Traditional evaluation methods fail to
fully capture the full range of system capabilities and objectives.
Reference-based evaluations suffer from limitations in capturing the wide
variety of possible correction and the biases introduced during reference
creation and is prone to favor fixing local errors over overall text
improvement. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further
highlighted the shortcomings of these evaluation strategies, emphasizing the
need for a paradigm shift in evaluation methodology. In the current study, we
perform a comprehensive evaluation of various GEC systems using a recently
published dataset of Swedish learner texts. The evaluation is performed using
established evaluation metrics as well as human judges. We find that GPT-3 in a
few-shot setting by far outperforms previous grammatical error correction
systems for Swedish, a language comprising only 0.11% of its training data. We
also found that current evaluation methods contain undesirable biases that a
human evaluation is able to reveal. We suggest using human post-editing of GEC

<p class="mathjax">Structure-preserving bisimilarity is a truly concurrent behavioral
equivalence for finite Petri nets, which relates markings (of the same size
only) generating the same causal nets, hence also the same partial orders of
events. The process algebra FNM truly represents all (and only) the finite
Petri nets, up to isomorphism. We prove that structure-preserving bisimilarity
is a congruence w.r.t. the FMN operators, In this way, we have defined a
compositional semantics, fully respecting causality and the branching structure
of systems, for the class of all the finite Petri nets. Moreover, we study some
algebraic properties of structure-preserving bisimilarity, that are at the base
of a sound (but incomplete) axiomatization over FNM process terms.

<p class="mathjax">A primary challenge of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is its
generalization beyond the training domain, especially when dealing with complex
physical problems represented by partial differential equations (PDEs). This
paper aims to enhance the generalization capabilities of PIML, facilitating
practical, real-world applications where accurate predictions in unexplored
regions are crucial. We leverage the inherent causality and temporal sequential
characteristics of PDE solutions to fuse PIML models with recurrent neural
architectures based on systems of ordinary differential equations, referred to
as neural oscillators. Through effectively capturing long-time dependencies and
mitigating the exploding and vanishing gradient problem, neural oscillators
foster improved generalization in PIML tasks. Extensive experimentation
involving time-dependent nonlinear PDEs and biharmonic beam equations
demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach. Incorporating neural
oscillators outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark problems
across various metrics. Consequently, the proposed method improves the
generalization capabilities of PIML, providing accurate solutions for
extrapolation and prediction beyond the training data.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we demonstrate that the concept of Semantic Consistency and
the ensuing method of Knowledge-Aware Re-Optimization can be adapted for the
problem of object detection in intricate traffic scenes. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel method for extracting a knowledge graph from a dataset of
images provided with instance-level annotations, and integrate this new
knowledge graph with the existing semantic consistency model. Combining both
this novel hybrid knowledge graph and the preexisting methods of frequency
analysis and external knowledge graph as sources for semantic information, we
investigate the effectiveness of knowledge-aware re-optimization on the
Faster-RCNN and DETR object detection models. We find that limited but
consistent improvements in precision and or recall can be achieved using this
method for all combinations of model and method studied.

<p class="mathjax">Proper incentives are important for motivating developers in open-source
communities, which is crucial for maintaining the development of open-source
software healthy. To provide such incentives, an accurate and objective
developer contribution measurement method is needed. However, existing methods
rely heavily on manual peer review, lacking objectivity and transparency. The
metrics of some automated works about effort estimation use only syntax-level
or even text-level information, such as changed lines of code, which lack
robustness. Furthermore, some works about identifying core developers provide
only a qualitative understanding without a quantitative score or have some
project-specific parameters, which makes them not practical in real-world
projects. To this end, we propose CValue, a multidimensional information
fusion-based approach to measure developer contributions. CValue extracts both
syntax and semantic information from the source code changes in four
dimensions: modification amount, understandability, inter-function and
intra-function impact of modification. It fuses the information to produce the
contribution score for each of the commits in the projects. Experimental
results show that CValue outperforms other approaches by 19.59% on 10
real-world projects with manually labeled ground truth. We validated and proved
that the performance of CValue, which takes 83.39 seconds per commit, is
acceptable to be applied in real-world projects. Furthermore, we performed a
large-scale experiment on 174 projects and detected 2,282 developers having
inflated commits. Of these, 2,050 developers did not make any syntax
contribution; and 103 were identified as bots.

hierarchical hybrid control policies from a set of low-level control policies
using a tree structure. Many robotic tasks are naturally decomposed into a
hierarchy of control tasks, and modularity is a well-known tool for handling
complexity, therefor behavior trees have garnered widespread usage in the
robotics community. In this paper, we study the convergence of BTs, in the
sense of reaching a desired part of the state space. Earlier results on BT
convergence were often tailored to specific families of BTs, created using
different design principles. The results of this paper generalize the earlier

<p class="mathjax">Multicast short video streaming (MSVS) can effectively reduce network traffic
load by delivering identical video sequences to multiple users simultaneously.
The existing MSVS schemes mainly rely on the aggregated video requests to
reserve bandwidth and computing resources, which cannot satisfy users' diverse
and dynamic service requirements, particularly when users' swipe behaviors
exhibit spatiotemporal fluctuation. In this paper, we propose a user-centric
resource management scheme based on the digital twin (DT) technique, which aims
to enhance user satisfaction as well as reduce resource consumption. Firstly,
we design a user DT (UDT)-assisted resource reservation framework.
Specifically, UDTs are constructed for individual users, which store users'
historical data for updating multicast groups and abstracting useful
information. The swipe probability distributions and recommended video lists
are abstracted from UDTs to predict bandwidth and computing resource demands.
Parameterized sigmoid functions are leveraged to characterize multicast groups'
user satisfaction. Secondly, we formulate a joint non-convex bandwidth and
computing resource reservation problem which is transformed into a convex
piecewise problem by utilizing a tangent function to approximately substitute
the concave part. A low-complexity scheduling algorithm is then developed to
find the optimal resource reservation decisions. Simulation results based on
the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms
benchmark schemes in terms of user satisfaction and resource consumption.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can improve the quality of
large language model's (LLM) outputs by aligning them with human preferences.
We propose a simple algorithm for aligning LLMs with human preferences inspired
by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call Reinforced
Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy, ReST produces a dataset by
generating samples from the policy, which are then used to improve the LLM
policy using offline RL algorithms. ReST is more efficient than typical online
RLHF methods because the training dataset is produced offline, which allows
data reuse. While ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative
learning settings, we focus on its application to machine translation. Our
results show that ReST can substantially improve translation quality, as
measured by automated metrics and human evaluation on machine translation
benchmarks in a compute and sample-efficient manner.

<p class="mathjax">Benefiting from the strong view-consistent information mining capacity,
multi-view contrastive clustering has attracted plenty of attention in recent
years. However, we observe the following drawback, which limits the clustering
performance from further improvement. The existing multi-view models mainly
focus on the consistency of the same samples in different views while ignoring
the circumstance of similar but different samples in cross-view scenarios. To
solve this problem, we propose a novel Dual contrastive calibration network for
Multi-View Clustering (DealMVC). Specifically, we first design a fusion
mechanism to obtain a global cross-view feature. Then, a global contrastive
calibration loss is proposed by aligning the view feature similarity graph and
the high-confidence pseudo-label graph. Moreover, to utilize the diversity of
multi-view information, we propose a local contrastive calibration loss to
constrain the consistency of pair-wise view features. The feature structure is
regularized by reliable class information, thus guaranteeing similar samples
have similar features in different views. During the training procedure, the
interacted cross-view feature is jointly optimized at both local and global
levels. In comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, the comprehensive
experimental results obtained from eight benchmark datasets provide substantial
validation of the effectiveness and superiority of our algorithm. We release
the code of DealMVC at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/DealMVC on GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the complexity and size of modern software systems, the amount of logs
generated is tremendous. Hence, it is infeasible to manually investigate these
data in a reasonable time, thereby requiring automating log analysis to derive
insights about the functioning of the systems. Motivated by an industry
use-case, we zoom-in on one integral part of automated log analysis, log
parsing, which is the prerequisite to deriving any insights from logs. Our
investigation reveals problematic aspects within the log parsing field,
particularly its inefficiency in handling heterogeneous real-world logs. We
show this by assessing the 14 most-recognized log parsing approaches in the
literature using (i) nine publicly available datasets, (ii) one dataset
comprised of combined publicly available data, and (iii) one dataset generated
within the infrastructure of a large bank. Subsequently, toward improving log
parsing robustness in real-world production scenarios, we propose a tool,
Logchimera, that enables estimating log parsing performance in industry
contexts through generating synthetic log data that resemble industry logs. Our
contributions serve as a foundation to consolidate past research efforts,
facilitate future research advancements, and establish a strong link between
research and industry log parsing.

collaboration across diverse computing facilities, including High Performance
Computing (HPC) machines and the Edge-to-Cloud continuum. Integrated data
analysis plays a crucial role in scientific discovery, especially in the
current AI era, by enabling Responsible AI development, FAIR, Reproducibility,
and User Steering. However, the heterogeneous nature of science poses
challenges such as dealing with multiple supporting tools, cross-facility
environments, and efficient HPC execution. Building on data observability,
adapter system design, and provenance, we propose MIDA: an approach for
lightweight runtime Multi-workflow Integrated Data Analysis. MIDA defines data
observability strategies and adaptability methods for various parallel systems
and machine learning tools. With observability, it intercepts the dataflows in
the background without requiring instrumentation while integrating domain,
provenance, and telemetry data at runtime into a unified database ready for
user steering queries. We conduct experiments showing end-to-end multi-workflow
analysis integrating data from Dask and MLFlow in a real distributed deep
learning use case for materials science that runs on multiple environments with
up to 276 GPUs in parallel. We show near-zero overhead running up to 100,000

<p class="mathjax">Logo embedding plays a crucial role in various e-commerce applications by
facilitating image retrieval or recognition, such as intellectual property
protection and product search. However, current methods treat logo embedding as
a purely visual problem, which may limit their performance in real-world
scenarios. A notable issue is that the textual knowledge embedded in logo
images has not been adequately explored. Therefore, we propose a novel approach
that leverages textual knowledge as an auxiliary to improve the robustness of
logo embedding. The emerging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both visual and textual understanding
and could become valuable visual assistants in understanding logo images.
Inspired by this observation, our proposed method, FashionLOGO, aims to utilize
MLLMs to enhance fashion logo embedding. We explore how MLLMs can improve logo
embedding by prompting them to generate explicit textual knowledge through
three types of prompts, including image OCR, brief captions, and detailed
descriptions prompts, in a zero-shot setting. We adopt a cross-attention
transformer to enable image embedding queries to learn supplementary knowledge
from textual embeddings automatically. To reduce computational costs, we only
use the image embedding model in the inference stage, similar to traditional
inference pipelines. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that FashionLOGO learns generalized and robust logo embeddings,
achieving state-of-the-art performance in all benchmark datasets. Furthermore,
we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the performance
improvements resulting from the introduction of MLLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Emotions play a significant role in the cognitive processes of the human
brain, such as decision making, learning and perception. The use of
physiological signals has shown to lead to more objective, reliable and
accurate emotion recognition combined with raising machine learning methods.
Supervised learning methods have dominated the attention of the research
community, but the challenge in collecting needed labels makes emotion
recognition difficult in large-scale semi- or uncontrolled experiments.
Unsupervised methods are increasingly being explored, however sub-optimal
signal feature selection and label identification challenges unsupervised
methods' accuracy and applicability. This article proposes an unsupervised deep
cluster framework for emotion recognition from physiological and psychological
data. Tests on the open benchmark data set WESAD show that deep k-means and
deep c-means distinguish the four quadrants of Russell's circumplex model of
affect with an overall accuracy of 87%. Seeding the clusters with the subject's
subjective assessments helps to circumvent the need for labels.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose trait-based merge trees a generalization of merge
trees to feature level sets, targeting the analysis of tensor field or general
multi-variate data. For this, we employ the notion of traits defined in
attribute space as introduced in the feature level sets framework. The
resulting distance field in attribute space induces a scalar field in the
spatial domain that serves as input for topological data analysis. The leaves
in the merge tree represent those areas in the input data that are closest to
the defined trait and thus most closely resemble the defined feature. Hence,
the merge tree yields a hierarchy of features that allows for querying the most
relevant and persistent features. The presented method includes different query
methods for the tree which enable the highlighting of different aspects. We
demonstrate the cross-application capabilities of this approach with three case
studies from different domains.

<p class="mathjax">The IoT is getting more and more pervasive. Even the simplest devices, such
as a light bulb or an electrical plug, are made "smart" and controllable by our
smartphone. This paper describes the findings obtained by applying the PETIoT
kill chain to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing
session on a smart bulb, the Tapo L530E by Tp-Link, currently best seller on
Amazon Italy. We found that four vulnerabilities affect the bulb, two of High
severity and two of Medium severity according to the CVSS v3.1 scoring system.
In short, authentication is not well accounted for and confidentiality is
insufficiently achieved by the implemented cryptographic measures. In
consequence, an attacker who is nearby the bulb can operate at will not just
the bulb but all devices of the Tapo family that the user may have on her Tapo
account. Moreover, the attacker can learn the victim's Wi-Fi password, thereby
escalating his malicious potential considerably. The paper terminates with an
outline of possible fixes.

$O(\log^{**}n)$, and $O(\alpha(n))$ amortized cost upper bounds. The proof of
the $O(\log\log{n})$ amortized bound goes as follows. Let each node's potential
be the square root of its size, i.e., the size of the subtree rooted from it.
The overall potential increase is $O(n)$ because the node sizes increase
geometrically along any tree path. When compressing a path, each node on the
path satisfies that either its potential decreases by $\Omega(1)$, or its
child's size along the path is less than the square root of its size: this can
happen at most $O(\log\log{n})$ times along any tree path.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-View Stereo~(MVS) is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision
which aims to reconstruct a scene using multi-view images with known camera
parameters. However, the mainstream approaches represent the scene with a fixed
all-pixel depth range and equal depth interval partition, which will result in
inadequate utilization of depth planes and imprecise depth estimation. In this
paper, we present a novel multi-stage coarse-to-fine framework to achieve
adaptive all-pixel depth range and depth interval. We predict a coarse depth
map in the first stage, then an Adaptive Depth Range Prediction module is
proposed in the second stage to zoom in the scene by leveraging the reference
image and the obtained depth map in the first stage and predict a more accurate
all-pixel depth range for the following stages. In the third and fourth stages,
we propose an Adaptive Depth Interval Adjustment module to achieve adaptive
variable interval partition for pixel-wise depth range. The depth interval
distribution in this module is normalized by Z-score, which can allocate dense
depth hypothesis planes around the potential ground truth depth value and vice
versa to achieve more accurate depth estimation. Extensive experiments on four
widely used benchmark datasets~(DTU, TnT, BlendedMVS, ETH 3D) demonstrate that
our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and yields competitive
generalization ability. Particularly, our method achieves the highest Acc and
Overall on the DTU dataset, while attaining the highest Recall and
$F_{1}$-score on the Tanks and Temples intermediate and advanced dataset.
Moreover, our method also achieves the lowest $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$ on the
BlendedMVS dataset and the highest Acc and $F_{1}$-score on the ETH 3D dataset,
surpassing all listed methods.Project website:

<p class="mathjax">Dairy farming is a particularly energy-intensive part of the agriculture
sector. Effective battery management is essential for renewable integration
within the agriculture sector. However, controlling battery
charging/discharging is a difficult task due to electricity demand variability,
stochasticity of renewable generation, and energy price fluctuations. Despite
the potential benefits of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to renewable
energy in the context of dairy farming, there has been limited research in this
area. This research is a priority for Ireland as it strives to meet its
governmental goals in energy and sustainability. This research paper utilizes
Q-learning to learn an effective policy for charging and discharging a battery
within a dairy farm setting. The results demonstrate that the developed policy
significantly reduces electricity costs compared to the established baseline
algorithm. These findings highlight the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
for battery management within the dairy farming sector.

<p class="mathjax">Approximately 15% of the world's population is suffering from various
disabilities or impairments. However, many mobile UX designers and developers
disregard the significance of accessibility for those with disabilities when
developing apps. A large number of studies and some effective tools for
detecting accessibility issues have been conducted and proposed to mitigate
such a severe problem. However, compared with detection, the repair work is
obviously falling behind. Especially for the color-related accessibility
issues, which is one of the top issues in apps with a greatly negative impact
on vision and user experience. Apps with such issues are difficult to use for
people with low vision and the elderly. Unfortunately, such an issue type
cannot be directly fixed by existing repair techniques. To this end, we propose
Iris, an automated and context-aware repair method to fix the color-related
accessibility issues (i.e., the text contrast issues and the image contrast
issues) for apps. By leveraging a novel context-aware technique that resolves
the optimal colors and a vital phase of attribute-to-repair localization, Iris
not only repairs the color contrast issues but also guarantees the consistency
of the design style between the original UI page and repaired UI page. Our
experiments unveiled that Iris can achieve a 91.38% repair success rate with
high effectiveness and efficiency. The usefulness of Iris has also been
evaluated by a user study with a high satisfaction rate as well as developers'
positive feedback. 9 of 40 submitted pull requests on GitHub repositories have
been accepted and merged into the projects by app developers, and another 4
developers are actively discussing with us for further repair. Iris is publicly
available to facilitate this new research direction.

<p class="mathjax">Transaction processing is of growing importance for mobile and web
applications. Booking tickets, flight reservation, e-Banking, e-Payment, and
booking holiday arrangements are just a few examples. Due to temporarily
disconnected situations the synchronization and consistent transaction
processing are key issues. To avoid difficulties with blocked transactions or
communication loss several authors and technology providers have recommended to
use Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) to solve the problem. However most
vendors of Relational Database Management Systems (DBMS) implemented only
locking schemes for concurrency control which prohibit the immediate use of
OCC. We propose Row Version Verifying (RVV) discipline to avoid lost updates
and achieve a kind of OCC for those DBMS not providing an adequate non-blocking
concurrency control. Moreover, the different mechanisms are categorized as
access pattern in order to provide programmers with a general guideline for SQL
databases. The proposed SQL access patterns are relevant for all transactional
applications with unreliable communication and low conflicting situations. We
demonstrate the proposed solution using mainstream database systems like
Oracle, DB2, and SQLServer.

secret bits from sampling a joint probability distribution, unknown to an
eavesdropper Eve. The secret-key rate has been bounded above by the intrinsic
information and reduced intrinsic information. However, we prove that the
reduced intrinsic information is 0 if and only if the intrinsic information is
0. This result implies that at least one of the following two conjectures is
false: bound secrecy exists, or the reduced intrinsic information equals the
secret-key rate. We give an explicit construction of an information-erasing
binarization for a candidate for bound secrecy. We then introduce some
approaches for proving the existence of bound secrecy, such as reducing the
channel space, linearly transforming Bob's map, and perturbing a channel for
Eve.

<p class="mathjax">Natural Language Explanations (NLE) aim at supplementing the prediction of a
model with human-friendly natural text. Existing NLE approaches involve
training separate models for each downstream task. In this work, we propose
Uni-NLX, a unified framework that consolidates all NLE tasks into a single and
compact multi-task model using a unified training objective of text generation.
Additionally, we introduce two new NLE datasets: 1) ImageNetX, a dataset of
144K samples for explaining ImageNet categories, and 2) VQA-ParaX, a dataset of
123K samples for explaining the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). Both
datasets are derived leveraging large language models (LLMs). By training on
the 1M combined NLE samples, our single unified framework is capable of
simultaneously performing seven NLE tasks including VQA, visual recognition and
visual reasoning tasks with 7X fewer parameters, demonstrating comparable
performance to the independent task-specific models in previous approaches, and
in certain tasks even outperforming them. Code is at

<p class="mathjax">Synthesizing physically plausible human motions in 3D scenes is a challenging
problem. Kinematics-based methods cannot avoid inherent artifacts (e.g.,
penetration and foot skating) due to the lack of physical constraints.
Meanwhile, existing physics-based methods cannot generalize to multi-object
scenarios since the policy trained with reinforcement learning has limited
modeling capacity. In this work, we present a framework that enables physically
simulated characters to perform long-term interaction tasks in diverse,
cluttered, and unseen scenes. The key idea is to decompose human-scene
interactions into two fundamental processes, Interacting and Navigating, which
motivates us to construct two reusable Controller, i.e., InterCon and NavCon.
Specifically, InterCon contains two complementary policies that enable
characters to enter and leave the interacting state (e.g., sitting on a chair
and getting up). To generate interaction with objects at different places, we
further design NavCon, a trajectory following policy, to keep characters'
locomotion in the free space of 3D scenes. Benefiting from the divide and
conquer strategy, we can train the policies in simple environments and
generalize to complex multi-object scenes. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework can synthesize physically plausible long-term human motions
in complex 3D scenes. Code will be publicly released at

<p class="mathjax">We introduce MarginMatch, a new SSL approach combining consistency
regularization and pseudo-labeling, with its main novelty arising from the use
of unlabeled data training dynamics to measure pseudo-label quality. Instead of
using only the model's confidence on an unlabeled example at an arbitrary
iteration to decide if the example should be masked or not, MarginMatch also
analyzes the behavior of the model on the pseudo-labeled examples as the
training progresses, to ensure low quality predictions are masked out.
MarginMatch brings substantial improvements on four vision benchmarks in low
data regimes and on two large-scale datasets, emphasizing the importance of
enforcing high-quality pseudo-labels. Notably, we obtain an improvement in
error rate over the state-of-the-art of 3.25% on CIFAR-100 with only 25 labels
per class and of 3.78% on STL-10 using as few as 4 labels per class. We make
our code available at https://github.com/tsosea2/MarginMatch.

<p class="mathjax">Many open source projects provide good first issues (GFIs) to attract and
retain newcomers. Although several automated GFI recommenders have been
proposed, existing recommenders are limited to recommending generic GFIs
without considering differences between individual newcomers. However, we
observe mismatches between generic GFIs and the diverse background of
newcomers, resulting in failed attempts, discouraged onboarding, and delayed
issue resolution. To address this problem, we assume that personalized first
issues (PFIs) for newcomers could help reduce the mismatches. To justify the
assumption, we empirically analyze 37 newcomers and their first issues resolved
across multiple projects. We find that the first issues resolved by the same
newcomer share similarities in task type, programming language, and project
domain. These findings underscore the need for a PFI recommender to improve
over state-of-the-art approaches. For that purpose, we identify features that
influence newcomers' personalized selection of first issues by analyzing the
relationship between possible features of the newcomers and the characteristics
of the newcomers' chosen first issues. We find that the expertise preference,
OSS experience, activeness, and sentiment of newcomers drive their personalized
choice of the first issues. Based on these findings, we propose a Personalized
First Issue Recommender (PFIRec), which employs LamdaMART to rank candidate
issues for a given newcomer by leveraging the identified influential features.
We evaluate PFIRec using a dataset of 68,858 issues from 100 GitHub projects.
The evaluation results show that PFIRec outperforms existing first issue
recommenders, potentially doubling the probability that the top recommended
issue is suitable for a specific newcomer and reducing one-third of a
newcomer's unsuccessful attempts to identify suitable first issues, in the
median.

<p class="mathjax">In fisheye images, rich distinct distortion patterns are regularly
distributed in the image plane. These distortion patterns are independent of
the visual content and provide informative cues for rectification. To make the
best of such rectification cues, we introduce SimFIR, a simple framework for
fisheye image rectification based on self-supervised representation learning.
Technically, we first split a fisheye image into multiple patches and extract
their representations with a Vision Transformer (ViT). To learn fine-grained
distortion representations, we then associate different image patches with
their specific distortion patterns based on the fisheye model, and further
subtly design an innovative unified distortion-aware pretext task for their
learning. The transfer performance on the downstream rectification task is
remarkably boosted, which verifies the effectiveness of the learned
representations. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the
state-of-the-art algorithms as well as its strong generalization ability on
real-world fisheye images.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the lower limits of encoding and processing the
information acquired through interactions between an internal system (robot
algorithms or software) and an external system (robot body and its environment)
in terms of action and observation histories. Both are modeled as transition
systems. We want to know the weakest internal system that is sufficient for
achieving passive (filtering) and active (planning) tasks. We introduce the
notion of an information transition system for the internal system which is a
transition system over a space of information states that reflect a robot's or
other observer's perspective based on limited sensing, memory, computation, and
actuation. An information transition system is viewed as a filter and a policy
or plan is viewed as a function that labels the states of this information
transition system. Regardless of whether internal systems are obtained by
learning algorithms, planning algorithms, or human insight, we want to know the
limits of feasibility for given robot hardware and tasks. We establish, in a
general setting, that minimal information transition systems exist up to
reasonable equivalence assumptions, and are unique under some general
conditions. We then apply the theory to generate new insights into several
problems, including optimal sensor fusion/filtering, solving basic planning
tasks, and finding minimal representations for modeling a system given
input-output relations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents fault detection and classification using Wavelet and ANN
based methods in a DFIG-based series compensated system. The state-of-the art
methods include Wavelet transform, Fourier transform, and Wavelet-neuro fuzzy
methods-based system for fault detection and classification. However, the
accuracy of these state-of-the-art methods diminishes during variable
conditions such as changes in wind speed, high impedance faults, and the
changes in the series compensation level. Specifically, in Wavelet transform
based methods, the threshold values need to be adapted based on the variable
field conditions. To solve this problem, this paper has proposed a Wavelet-ANN
based fault detection method where Wavelet is used as an identifier and ANN is
used as a classifier for detecting various fault cases. This methodology is
also effective under SSR condition. The proposed methodology is evaluated on
various fault and non-fault cases generated on an IEEE first benchmark model
under varying compensation levels from 20% to 55%, impedance faults, and wind
velocity from 6m/sec to 10m/sec using MATLAB/Simulink, OPALRT(OP4510)
manufactured real-time digital simulator environment, Arduino board I/O ports
communicating with external PC in which ANN model dumped, using Arduino support
package of MATLAB. The preliminary results are compared with the
state-of-the-art fault detection method, where the proposed method shows robust
performance under varying field conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Text style transfer techniques are gaining popularity in natural language
processing allowing paraphrasing text in the required form: from toxic to
neural, from formal to informal, from old to the modern English language, etc.
Solving the task is not sufficient to generate some neural/informal/modern
text, but it is important to preserve the original content unchanged. This
requirement becomes even more critical in some applications such as style
transfer of goal-oriented dialogues where the factual information shall be kept
to preserve the original message, e.g. ordering a certain type of pizza to a
certain address at a certain time. The aspect of content preservation is
critical for real-world applications of style transfer studies, but it has
received little attention. To bridge this gap we perform a comparison of
various style transfer models on the example of the formality transfer domain.
To perform a study of the content preservation abilities of various style
transfer methods we create a parallel dataset of formal vs. informal
task-oriented dialogues. The key difference between our dataset and the
existing ones like GYAFC [17] is the presence of goal-oriented dialogues with
predefined semantic slots essential to be kept during paraphrasing, e.g. named
entities. This additional annotation allowed us to conduct a precise
comparative study of several state-of-the-art techniques for style transfer.
Another result of our study is a modification of the unsupervised method LEWIS
[19] which yields a substantial improvement over the original method and all
evaluated baselines on the proposed task.

<p class="mathjax">A natural way to resolve different points of view and form opinions is
through exchanging arguments and knowledge. Facing the vast amount of available
information on the internet, people tend to focus on information consistent
with their beliefs. Especially when the issue is controversial, information is
often selected that does not challenge one's beliefs. To support a fair and
unbiased opinion-building process, we propose a chatbot system that engages in
a deliberative dialogue with a human. In contrast to persuasive systems, the
envisioned chatbot aims to provide a diverse and representative overview -
embedded in a conversation with the user. To account for a reflective and
unbiased exploration of the topic, we enable the system to intervene if the
user is too focused on their pre-existing opinion. Therefore we propose a model
to estimate the users' reflective engagement (RUE), defined as their critical
thinking and open-mindedness. We report on a user study with 58 participants to
test our model and the effect of the intervention mechanism, discuss the
implications of the results, and present perspectives for future work. The
results show a significant effect on both user reflection and total user focus,
proving our proposed approach's validity.

<p class="mathjax">Uncertainty quantification is critical for deploying deep neural networks
(DNNs) in real-world applications. An Auxiliary Uncertainty Estimator (AuxUE)
is one of the most effective means to estimate the uncertainty of the main task
prediction without modifying the main task model. To be considered robust, an
AuxUE must be capable of maintaining its performance and triggering higher
uncertainties while encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs, i.e., to
provide robust aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. However, for vision
regression tasks, current AuxUE designs are mainly adopted for aleatoric
uncertainty estimates, and AuxUE robustness has not been explored. In this
work, we propose a generalized AuxUE scheme for more robust uncertainty
quantification on regression tasks. Concretely, to achieve a more robust
aleatoric uncertainty estimation, different distribution assumptions are
considered for heteroscedastic noise, and Laplace distribution is finally
chosen to approximate the prediction error. For epistemic uncertainty, we
propose a novel solution named Discretization-Induced Dirichlet pOsterior
(DIDO), which models the Dirichlet posterior on the discretized prediction
error. Extensive experiments on age estimation, monocular depth estimation, and
super-resolution tasks show that our proposed method can provide robust
uncertainty estimates in the face of noisy inputs and that it can be scalable
to both image-level and pixel-wise tasks.

<p class="mathjax">As the amount of textual data in various fields, including software
development, continues to grow, there is a pressing demand for efficient and
effective extraction and presentation of meaningful insights. This paper
presents a unique approach to address this need, focusing on the complexities
of interpreting Application Programming Interface (API) documentation. While
official API documentation serves as a primary source of information for
developers, it can often be extensive and lacks user-friendliness. In light of
this, developers frequently resort to unofficial sources like Stack Overflow
and GitHub. Our novel approach employs the strengths of BERTopic for topic
modeling and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate
summaries of API documentation, thereby creating a more efficient method for
developers to extract the information they need. The produced summaries and
topics are evaluated based on their performance, coherence, and
interoperability.
<br />The findings of this research contribute to the field of API documentation
analysis by providing insights into recurring topics, identifying common
issues, and generating potential solutions. By improving the accessibility and
efficiency of API documentation comprehension, our work aims to enhance the
software development process and empower developers with practical tools for
navigating complex APIs.

<p class="mathjax">Spintronic devices offer a promising avenue for the development of nanoscale,
energy-efficient artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing. It has
previously been shown that with antiferromagnetic (AFM) oscillators, ultra-fast
spiking artificial neurons can be made that mimic many unique features of
biological neurons. In this work, we train an artificial neural network of AFM
neurons to perform pattern recognition. A simple machine learning algorithm
called spike pattern association neuron (SPAN), which relies on the temporal
position of neuron spikes, is used during training. In under a microsecond of
physical time, the AFM neural network is trained to recognize symbols composed
from a grid by producing a spike within a specified time window. We further
achieve multi-symbol recognition with the addition of an output layer to
suppress undesirable spikes. Through the utilization of AFM neurons and the
SPAN algorithm, we create a neural network capable of high-accuracy recognition
with overall power consumption on the order of picojoules.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an appealing machine learning approach
to deal with massive raw data generated at multiple mobile devices, {which
needs to aggregate the training model parameter of every mobile device at one
base station (BS) iteratively}. For parameter aggregating in FL, over-the-air
computation is a spectrum-efficient solution, which allows all mobile devices
to transmit their parameter-mapped signals concurrently to a BS. Due to
heterogeneous channel fading and noise, there exists difference between the
BS's received signal and its desired signal, measured as the mean-squared error
(MSE). To minimize the MSE, we propose to jointly optimize the signal
amplification factors at the BS and the mobile devices as well as the data size
(the number of data samples involved in local training) at every mobile device.
The formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity. To
find the optimal solution, with some simplification on cost function and
variable replacement, which still preserves equivalence, we transform the
changed problem to be a bi-level problem equivalently. For the lower-level
problem, optimal solution is found by enumerating every candidate solution from
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. For the upper-level problem, the
optimal solution is found by exploring its piecewise convexity. Numerical
results show that our proposed method can greatly reduce the MSE and can help
to improve the training performance of FL compared with benchmark methods.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-lingual named entity recognition (CrossNER) faces challenges stemming
from uneven performance due to the scarcity of multilingual corpora, especially
for non-English data. While prior efforts mainly focus on data-driven transfer
methods, a significant aspect that has not been fully explored is aligning both
semantic and token-level representations across diverse languages. In this
paper, we propose Multi-view Contrastive Learning for Cross-lingual Named
Entity Recognition (mCL-NER). Specifically, we reframe the CrossNER task into a
problem of recognizing relationships between pairs of tokens. This approach
taps into the inherent contextual nuances of token-to-token connections within
entities, allowing us to align representations across different languages. A
multi-view contrastive learning framework is introduced to encompass semantic
contrasts between source, codeswitched, and target sentences, as well as
contrasts among token-to-token relations. By enforcing agreement within both
semantic and relational spaces, we minimize the gap between source sentences
and their counterparts of both codeswitched and target sentences. This
alignment extends to the relationships between diverse tokens, enhancing the
projection of entities across languages. We further augment CrossNER by
combining self-training with labeled source data and unlabeled target data. Our
experiments on the XTREME benchmark, spanning 40 languages, demonstrate the
superiority of mCL-NER over prior data-driven and model-based approaches. It
achieves a substantial increase of nearly +2.0 $F_1$ scores across a broad
spectrum and establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art performer.

<p class="mathjax">Urban Air Mobility (UAM) promises a new dimension to decongested, safe, and
fast travel in urban and suburban hubs. These UAM aircraft are conceived to
operate from small airports called vertiports each comprising multiple
take-off/landing and battery-recharging spots. Since they might be situated in
dense urban areas and need to handle many aircraft landings and take-offs each
hour, managing this schedule in real-time becomes challenging for a traditional
air-traffic controller but instead calls for an automated solution. This paper
provides a novel approach to this problem of Urban Air Mobility - Vertiport
Schedule Management (UAM-VSM), which leverages graph reinforcement learning to
generate decision-support policies. Here the designated physical spots within
the vertiport's airspace and the vehicles being managed are represented as two
separate graphs, with feature extraction performed through a graph
convolutional network (GCN). Extracted features are passed onto perceptron
layers to decide actions such as continue to hover or cruise, continue idling
or take-off, or land on an allocated vertiport spot. Performance is measured
based on delays, safety (no. of collisions) and battery consumption. Through
realistic simulations in AirSim applied to scaled down multi-rotor vehicles,
our results demonstrate the suitability of using graph reinforcement learning
to solve the UAM-VSM problem and its superiority to basic reinforcement
learning (with graph embeddings) or random choice baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Conditional sampling of variational autoencoders (VAEs) is needed in various
applications, such as missing data imputation, but is computationally
intractable. A principled choice for asymptotically exact conditional sampling
is Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MWG). However, we observe that the tendency of VAEs
to learn a structured latent space, a commonly desired property, can cause the
MWG sampler to get "stuck" far from the target distribution. This paper
mitigates the limitations of MWG: we systematically outline the pitfalls in the
context of VAEs, propose two original methods that address these pitfalls, and
demonstrate an improved performance of the proposed methods on a set of
sampling tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Besides interacting correctly with other vehicles, automated vehicles should
also be able to react in a safe manner to vulnerable road users like
pedestrians or cyclists. For a safe interaction between pedestrians and
automated vehicles, the vehicle must be able to interpret the pedestrian's
behavior. Common environment models do not contain information like body poses
used to understand the pedestrian's intent. In this work, we propose an
environment model that includes the position of the pedestrians as well as
their pose information. We only use images from a monocular camera and the
vehicle's localization data as input to our pedestrian environment model. We
extract the skeletal information with a neural network human pose estimator
from the image. Furthermore, we track the skeletons with a simple tracking
algorithm based on the Hungarian algorithm and an ego-motion compensation. To
obtain the 3D information of the position, we aggregate the data from
consecutive frames in conjunction with the vehicle position. We demonstrate our
pedestrian environment model on data generated with the CARLA simulator and the
nuScenes dataset. Overall, we reach a relative position error of around 16% on
both datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Information leakage is a class of error that can lead to severe consequences.
However unlike other errors, it is rarely explicitly considered during the
software testing process. LeakFuzzer advances the state of the art by using a
noninterference security property together with a security flow policy as an
oracle. As the tool extends the state of the art fuzzer, AFL++, LeakFuzzer
inherits the advantages of AFL++ such as scalability, automated input
generation, high coverage and low developer intervention.
<br />The tool can detect the same set of errors that a normal fuzzer can detect,
with the addition of being able to detect violations of secure information flow
policies.
<br />We evaluated LeakFuzzer on a diverse set of 10 C and C++ benchmarks
containing known information leaks, ranging in size from just 80 to over 900k
lines of code. Seven of these are taken from real-world CVEs including
Heartbleed and a recent error in PostgreSQL. Given 20 24-hour runs, LeakFuzzer
can find 100% of the leaks in the SUTs whereas existing techniques using such
as the CBMC model checker and AFL++ augmented with different sanitizers can
only find 40% at best.

<p class="mathjax">Over-the-air computation is a communication-efficient solution for federated
learning (FL). In such a system, iterative procedure is performed: Local
gradient of private loss function is updated, amplified and then transmitted by
every mobile device; the server receives the aggregated gradient all-at-once,
generates and then broadcasts updated model parameters to every mobile device.
In terms of amplification factor selection, most related works suppose the
local gradient's maximal norm always happens although it actually fluctuates
over iterations, which may degrade convergence performance. To circumvent this
problem, we propose to turn local gradient to be normalized one before
amplifying it. Under our proposed method, when the loss function is smooth, we
prove our proposed method can converge to stationary point at sub-linear rate.
In case of smooth and strongly convex loss function, we prove our proposed
method can achieve minimal training loss at linear rate with any small positive
tolerance. Moreover, a tradeoff between convergence rate and the tolerance is
discovered. To speedup convergence, problems optimizing system parameters are
also formulated for above two cases. Although being non-convex, optimal
solution with polynomial complexity of the formulated problems are derived.
Experimental results show our proposed method can outperform benchmark methods
on convergence performance.

<p class="mathjax">We present MovePose, an optimized lightweight convolutional neural network
designed specifically for real-time body pose estimation on CPU-based mobile
devices. The current solutions do not provide satisfactory accuracy and speed
for human posture estimation, and MovePose addresses this gap. It aims to
maintain real-time performance while improving the accuracy of human posture
estimation for mobile devices. The network produces 17 keypoints for each
individual at a rate exceeding 11 frames per second, making it suitable for
real-time applications such as fitness tracking, sign language interpretation,
and advanced mobile human posture estimation. Our MovePose algorithm has
attained an Mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 67.7 on the COCO
\cite{cocodata} validation dataset. The MovePose algorithm displayed efficiency
with a performance of 69+ frames per second (fps) when run on an Intel
i9-10920x CPU. Additionally, it showcased an increased performance of 452+ fps
on an NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU. On an Android phone equipped with a Snapdragon 8 + 4G
processor, the fps reached above 11. To enhance accuracy, we incorporated three
techniques: deconvolution, large kernel convolution, and coordinate
classification methods. Compared to basic upsampling, deconvolution is
trainable, improves model capacity, and enhances the receptive field. Large
kernel convolution strengthens these properties at a decreased computational
cost. In summary, MovePose provides high accuracy and real-time performance,
marking it a potential tool for a variety of applications, including those
focused on mobile-side human posture estimation. The code and models for this
algorithm will be made publicly accessible.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an extension of the Contextual Graph Markov Model, a deep and
probabilistic machine learning model for graphs, to model the distribution of
edge features. Our approach is architectural, as we introduce an additional
Bayesian network mapping edge features into discrete states to be used by the
original model. In doing so, we are also able to build richer graph
representations even in the absence of edge features, which is confirmed by the
performance improvements on standard graph classification benchmarks. Moreover,
we successfully test our proposal in a graph regression scenario where edge
features are of fundamental importance, and we show that the learned edge
representation provides substantial performance improvements against the
original model on three link prediction tasks. By keeping the computational
complexity linear in the number of edges, the proposed model is amenable to
large-scale graph processing.

<p class="mathjax">Finding the right sound effects (SFX) to match moments in a video is a
difficult and time-consuming task, and relies heavily on the quality and
completeness of text metadata. Retrieving high-quality (HQ) SFX using a video
frame directly as the query is an attractive alternative, removing the reliance
on text metadata and providing a low barrier to entry for non-experts. Due to
the lack of HQ audio-visual training data, previous work on audio-visual
retrieval relies on YouTube (in-the-wild) videos of varied quality for
training, where the audio is often noisy and the video of amateur quality. As
such it is unclear whether these systems would generalize to the task of
matching HQ audio to production-quality video. To address this, we propose a
multimodal framework for recommending HQ SFX given a video frame by (1)
leveraging large language models and foundational vision-language models to
bridge HQ audio and video to create audio-visual pairs, resulting in a highly
scalable automatic audio-visual data curation pipeline; and (2) using
pre-trained audio and visual encoders to train a contrastive learning-based
retrieval system. We show that our system, trained using our automatic data
curation pipeline, significantly outperforms baselines trained on in-the-wild
data on the task of HQ SFX retrieval for video. Furthermore, while the
baselines fail to generalize to this task, our system generalizes well from
clean to in-the-wild data, outperforming the baselines on a dataset of YouTube
videos despite only being trained on the HQ audio-visual pairs. A user study
confirms that people prefer SFX retrieved by our system over the baseline 67%
of the time both for HQ and in-the-wild data. Finally, we present ablations to
determine the impact of model and data pipeline design choices on downstream
retrieval performance. Please visit our project website to listen to and view
our SFX retrieval results.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have been extended for
text-guided video editing, yielding impressive zero-shot video editing
performance. Nonetheless, the generated videos usually show spatial
irregularities and temporal inconsistencies as the temporal characteristics of
videos have not been faithfully modeled. In this paper, we propose an elegant
yet effective Temporal-Consistent Video Editing (TCVE) method, to mitigate the
temporal inconsistency challenge for robust text-guided video editing. In
addition to the utilization of a pretrained 2D Unet for spatial content
manipulation, we establish a dedicated temporal Unet architecture to faithfully
capture the temporal coherence of the input video sequences. Furthermore, to
establish coherence and interrelation between the spatial-focused and
temporal-focused components, a cohesive joint spatial-temporal modeling unit is
formulated. This unit effectively interconnects the temporal Unet with the
pretrained 2D Unet, thereby enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated
video output while simultaneously preserving the capacity for video content
manipulation. Quantitative experimental results and visualization results
demonstrate that TCVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video
temporal consistency and video editing capability, surpassing existing
benchmarks in the field.

<p class="mathjax">In the rapidly advancing technological landscape, smartwatches have
materialized as multifunctional devices integral to our daily routines.
Smartwatches store a substantial amount of personal information, potentially
serving as repositories of digital evidence. Thus, digital forensic researchers
have devoted considerable effort to exploring smartwatch forensic techniques.
However, it has been observed that prior studies have primarily treated
smartwatches as mere storage mediums for digital evidence, neglecting their
potential role in criminal activities. This paper presents the information
leakage perpetrated through smartwatches. We represent crime scenarios in an
environment where smartphones are not available, considering that the
perception that smartphones can be used as tools for criminal behavior prevails
in many organizations, while the potential of similar-use smartwatches is often
overlooked. We detail mechanisms for information leakage via file transfer and
camera control using smartwatches. Additionally, we present methods to
investigate each crime incident through smartwatch forensics. Finally, we
describe the limitations of post-incident responses and propose proactive
measures to prepare for potential crimes involving smartwatches. Keywords:

<p class="mathjax">Character re-identification, recognizing characters consistently across
different panels in comics, presents significant challenges due to limited
annotated data and complex variations in character appearances. To tackle this
issue, we introduce a robust semi-supervised framework that combines metric
learning with a novel 'Identity-Aware' self-supervision method by contrastive
learning of face and body pairs of characters. Our approach involves processing
both facial and bodily features within a unified network architecture,
facilitating the extraction of identity-aligned character embeddings that
capture individual identities while preserving the effectiveness of face and
body features. This integrated character representation enhances feature
extraction and improves character re-identification compared to
re-identification by face or body independently, offering a parameter-efficient
solution. By extensively validating our method using in-series and inter-series
evaluation metrics, we demonstrate its effectiveness in consistently
re-identifying comic characters. Compared to existing methods, our approach not
only addresses the challenge of character re-identification but also serves as
a foundation for downstream tasks since it can produce character embeddings
without restrictions of face and body availability, enriching the comprehension
of comic books. In our experiments, we leverage two newly curated datasets: the
'Comic Character Instances Dataset', comprising over a million character
instances and the 'Comic Sequence Identity Dataset', containing annotations of
identities within more than 3000 sets of four consecutive comic panels that we
collected.

<p class="mathjax">We propose ImGeoNet, a multi-view image-based 3D object detection framework
that models a 3D space by an image-induced geometry-aware voxel representation.
Unlike previous methods which aggregate 2D features into 3D voxels without
considering geometry, ImGeoNet learns to induce geometry from multi-view images
to alleviate the confusion arising from voxels of free space, and during the
inference phase, only images from multiple views are required. Besides, a
powerful pre-trained 2D feature extractor can be leveraged by our
representation, leading to a more robust performance. To evaluate the
effectiveness of ImGeoNet, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments
on three indoor datasets, namely ARKitScenes, ScanNetV2, and ScanNet200. The
results demonstrate that ImGeoNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art
multi-view image-based method, ImVoxelNet, on all three datasets in terms of
detection accuracy. In addition, ImGeoNet shows great data efficiency by
achieving results comparable to ImVoxelNet with 100 views while utilizing only
40 views. Furthermore, our studies indicate that our proposed image-induced
geometry-aware representation can enable image-based methods to attain superior
detection accuracy than the seminal point cloud-based method, VoteNet, in two
practical scenarios: (1) scenarios where point clouds are sparse and noisy,
such as in ARKitScenes, and (2) scenarios involve diverse object classes,
particularly classes of small objects, as in the case in ScanNet200.

<p class="mathjax">This research focuses on trajectory planning problems for autonomous vehicles
utilizing numerical optimal control techniques. The study reformulates the
constrained optimization problem into a nonlinear programming problem,
incorporating explicit collision avoidance constraints. We present three novel,
exact formulations to describe collision constraints. The first formulation is
derived from a proposition concerning the separation of a point and a convex
set. We prove the separating proposition through De Morgan's laws. Then,
leveraging the hyperplane separation theorem we propose two efficient
reformulations. Compared with the existing dual formulations and the first
formulation, they significantly reduce the number of auxiliary variables to be
optimized and inequality constraints within the nonlinear programming problem.
Finally, the efficacy of the proposed formulations is demonstrated in the
context of typical autonomous parking scenarios compared with state of the art.
For generality, we design three initial guesses to assess the computational
effort required for convergence to solutions when using the different collision
formulations. The results illustrate that the scheme employing De Morgan's laws
performs equally well with those utilizing dual formulations, while the other
two schemes based on hyperplane separation theorem exhibit the added benefit of
requiring lower computational resources.

<p class="mathjax">Resource-constrained perception systems such as edge computing and
vision-for-robotics require vision models to be both accurate and lightweight
in computation and memory usage. While knowledge distillation is a proven
strategy to enhance the performance of lightweight classification models, its
application to structured outputs like object detection and instance
segmentation remains a complicated task, due to the variability in outputs and
complex internal network modules involved in the distillation process. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective sequential approach to
knowledge distillation that progressively transfers the knowledge of a set of
teacher detectors to a given lightweight student. To distill knowledge from a
highly accurate but complex teacher model, we construct a sequence of teachers
to help the student gradually adapt. Our progressive strategy can be easily
combined with existing detection distillation mechanisms to consistently
maximize student performance in various settings. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to successfully distill knowledge from Transformer-based
teacher detectors to convolution-based students, and unprecedentedly boost the
performance of ResNet-50 based RetinaNet from 36.5% to 42.0% AP and Mask R-CNN
from 38.2% to 42.5% AP on the MS COCO benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Learning generalized face anti-spoofing (FAS) models against presentation
attacks is essential for the security of face recognition systems. Previous FAS
methods usually encourage models to extract discriminative features, of which
the distances within the same class (bonafide or attack) are pushed close while
those between bonafide and attack are pulled away. However, these methods are
designed based on Euclidean distance, which lacks generalization ability for
unseen attack detection due to poor hierarchy embedding ability. According to
the evidence that different spoofing attacks are intrinsically hierarchical, we
propose to learn richer hierarchical and discriminative spoofing cues in
hyperbolic space. Specifically, for unimodal FAS learning, the feature
embeddings are projected into the Poincar\'e ball, and then the hyperbolic
binary logistic regression layer is cascaded for classification. To further
improve generalization, we conduct hyperbolic contrastive learning for the
bonafide only while relaxing the constraints on diverse spoofing attacks. To
alleviate the vanishing gradient problem in hyperbolic space, a new feature
clipping method is proposed to enhance the training stability of hyperbolic
models. Besides, we further design a multimodal FAS framework with Euclidean
multimodal feature decomposition and hyperbolic multimodal feature fusion &amp;
classification. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (i.e., WMCA,
PADISI-Face, and SiW-M) with diverse attack types demonstrate that the proposed
method can bring significant improvement compared to the Euclidean baselines on
unseen attack detection. In addition, the proposed framework is also
generalized well on four benchmark datasets (i.e., MSU-MFSD, IDIAP
REPLAY-ATTACK, CASIA-FASD, and OULU-NPU) with a limited number of attack types.

<p class="mathjax">Information extraction and textual comprehension from materials literature
are vital for developing an exhaustive knowledge base that enables accelerated
materials discovery. Language models have demonstrated their capability to
answer domain-specific questions and retrieve information from knowledge bases.
However, there are no benchmark datasets in the materials domain that can
evaluate the understanding of the key concepts by these language models. In
this work, we curate a dataset of 650 challenging questions from the materials
domain that require the knowledge and skills of a materials student who has
cleared their undergraduate degree. We classify these questions based on their
structure and the materials science domain-based subcategories. Further, we
evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models on solving these questions
via zero-shot and chain of thought prompting. It is observed that GPT-4 gives
the best performance (~62% accuracy) as compared to GPT-3.5. Interestingly, in
contrast to the general observation, no significant improvement in accuracy is
observed with the chain of thought prompting. To evaluate the limitations, we
performed an error analysis, which revealed conceptual errors (~64%) as the
major contributor compared to computational errors (~36%) towards the reduced
performance of LLMs. We hope that the dataset and analysis performed in this
work will promote further research in developing better materials science
domain-specific LLMs and strategies for information extraction.

<p class="mathjax">Scene-aware Complementary Item Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging task which
requires to generate a set of compatible items across domains. Due to the
subjectivity, it is difficult to set up a rigorous standard for both data
collection and learning objectives. To address this challenging task, we
propose a visual compatibility concept, composed of similarity (resembling in
color, geometry, texture, and etc.) and complementarity (different items like
table vs chair completing a group). Based on this notion, we propose a
compatibility learning framework, a category-aware Flexible Bidirectional
Transformer (FBT), for visual "scene-based set compatibility reasoning" with
the cross-domain visual similarity input and auto-regressive complementary item
generation. We introduce a "Flexible Bidirectional Transformer (FBT)"
consisting of an encoder with flexible masking, a category prediction arm, and
an auto-regressive visual embedding prediction arm. And the inputs for FBT are
cross-domain visual similarity invariant embeddings, making this framework
quite generalizable. Furthermore, our proposed FBT model learns the
inter-object compatibility from a large set of scene images in a
self-supervised way. Compared with the SOTA methods, this approach achieves up
to 5.3% and 9.6% in FITB score and 22.3% and 31.8% SFID improvement on fashion
and furniture, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a concurrency control mechanism that does not follow a
'one concurrency control mechanism fits all needs' strategy. With the presented
mechanism a transaction runs under several concurrency control mechanisms and
the appropriate one is chosen based on the accessed data. For this purpose, the
data is divided into four classes based on its access type and usage
(semantics). Class $O$ (the optimistic class) implements a first-committer-wins
strategy, class $R$ (the reconciliation class) implements a
first-n-committers-win strategy, class $P$ (the pessimistic class) implements a
first-reader-wins strategy, and class $E$ (the escrow class) implements a
first-n-readers-win strategy. Accordingly, the model is called \PeFS. The
selected concurrency control mechanism may be automatically adapted at run-time
according to the current load or a known usage profile. This run-time
adaptation allows \Pe to balance the commit rate and the response time even
under changing conditions. \Pe outperforms the Snapshot Isolation concurrency
control in terms of response time by a factor of approximately 4.5 under heavy
transactional load (4000 concurrent transactions). As consequence, the degree
of concurrency is 3.2 times higher.

<p class="mathjax">Much of the knowledge encoded in transformer language models (LMs) may be
expressed in terms of relations: relations between words and their synonyms,
entities and their attributes, etc. We show that, for a subset of relations,
this computation is well-approximated by a single linear transformation on the
subject representation. Linear relation representations may be obtained by
constructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt, and
they exist for a variety of factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations.
However, we also identify many cases in which LM predictions capture relational
knowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not linearly encoded in their
representations. Our results thus reveal a simple, interpretable, but
heterogeneously deployed knowledge representation strategy in transformer LMs.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce EgoSchema, a very long-form video question-answering dataset,
and benchmark to evaluate long video understanding capabilities of modern
vision and language systems. Derived from Ego4D, EgoSchema consists of over
5000 human curated multiple choice question answer pairs, spanning over 250
hours of real video data, covering a very broad range of natural human activity
and behavior. For each question, EgoSchema requires the correct answer to be
selected between five given options based on a three-minute-long video clip.
While some prior works have proposed video datasets with long clip lengths, we
posit that merely the length of the video clip does not truly capture the
temporal difficulty of the video task that is being considered. To remedy this,
we introduce temporal certificate sets, a general notion for capturing the
intrinsic temporal understanding length associated with a broad range of video
understanding tasks &amp; datasets. Based on this metric, we find EgoSchema to have
intrinsic temporal lengths over 5.7x longer than the second closest dataset and
10x to 100x longer than any other video understanding dataset. Further, our
evaluation of several current state-of-the-art video and language models shows
them to be severely lacking in long-term video understanding capabilities. Even
models with several billions of parameters achieve QA accuracy less than 33%
(random is 20%) on the EgoSchema multi-choice question answering task, while
humans achieve about 76% accuracy. We posit that \name{}{}, with its long
intrinsic temporal structures and diverse complexity, would serve as a valuable
evaluation probe for developing effective long-term video understanding systems
in the future. Data and Zero-shot model evaluation code are open-sourced for
both public and commercial use under the Ego4D license at

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable fluency and competence across
various natural language tasks. However, recent research has highlighted their
sensitivity to variations in input prompts. To deploy LLMs in a safe and
reliable manner, it is crucial for their outputs to be consistent when prompted
with expressions that carry the same meaning or intent. While some existing
work has explored how state-of-the-art LLMs address this issue, their
evaluations have been confined to assessing lexical equality of single- or
multi-word answers, overlooking the consistency of generative text sequences.
For a more comprehensive understanding of the consistency of LLMs in open-ended
text generation scenarios, we introduce a general measure of semantic
consistency, and formulate multiple versions of this metric to evaluate the
performance of various LLMs. Our proposal demonstrates significantly higher
consistency and stronger correlation with human evaluations of output
consistency than traditional metrics based on lexical consistency. Finally, we
propose a novel prompting strategy, called Ask-to-Choose (A2C), to enhance
semantic consistency. When evaluated for closed-book question answering based
on answer variations from the TruthfulQA benchmark, A2C increases accuracy
metrics for pretrained and finetuned LLMs by up to 47%, and semantic
consistency metrics for instruction-tuned models by up to 7-fold.

<p class="mathjax">Source-Free Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFVUDA) methods consists in
the task of adapting an action recognition model, trained on a labelled source
dataset, to an unlabelled target dataset, without accessing the actual source
data. Previous approaches have attempted to address SFVUDA by leveraging
self-supervision (e.g., enforcing temporal consistency) derived from the target
data itself. In this work we take an orthogonal approach by exploiting
"web-supervision" from Large Language-Vision Models (LLVMs), driven by the
rationale that LLVMs contain rich world prior, which is surprisingly robust to
domain-shift. We showcase the unreasonable effectiveness of integrating LLVMs
for SFVUDA by devising an intuitive and parameter efficient method, which we
name as Domain Adaptation with Large Language-Vision models (DALL-V), that
distills the world prior and complementary source model information into a
student network tailored for the target. Despite the simplicity, DALL-V
achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art SFVUDA methods.

<p class="mathjax">Image structure-texture decomposition is a long-standing and fundamental
problem in both image processing and computer vision fields. In this paper, we
propose a generalized semi-sparse regularization framework for image structural
analysis and extraction, which allows us to decouple the underlying image
structures from complicated textural backgrounds. Combining with different
textural analysis models, such a regularization receives favorable properties
differing from many traditional methods. We demonstrate that it is not only
capable of preserving image structures without introducing notorious staircase
artifacts in polynomial-smoothing surfaces but is also applicable for
decomposing image textures with strong oscillatory patterns. Moreover, we also
introduce an efficient numerical solution based on an alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which gives rise to a simple and
maneuverable way for image structure-texture decomposition. The versatility of
the proposed method is finally verified by a series of experimental results
with the capability of producing comparable or superior image decomposition
results against cutting-edge methods.

<p class="mathjax">Augmented Reality (AR) is expected to become a pervasive component in
enabling shared virtual experiences. In order to facilitate collaboration among
multiple users, it is crucial for multi-user AR applications to establish a
consensus on the "shared state" of the virtual world and its augmentations,
through which they interact within augmented reality spaces. Current methods to
create and access shared state collect sensor data from devices (e.g., camera
images), process them, and integrate them into the shared state. However, this
process introduces new vulnerabilities and opportunities for attacks.
Maliciously writing false data to "poison" the shared state is a major concern
for the security of the downstream victims that depend on it. Another type of
vulnerability arises when reading the shared state; by providing false inputs,
an attacker can view hologram augmentations at locations they are not allowed
to access. In this work, we demonstrate a series of novel attacks on multiple
AR frameworks with shared states, focusing on three publicly-accessible
frameworks. We show that these frameworks, while using different underlying
implementations, scopes, and mechanisms to read from and write to the shared
state, have shared vulnerability to a unified threat model. Our evaluation of
these state-of-art AR applications demonstrates reliable attacks both on
updating and accessing shared state across the different systems. To defend
against such threats, we discuss a number of potential mitigation strategies
that can help enhance the security of multi-user AR applications.

<p class="mathjax">Social media sites have become a popular platform for individuals to seek and
share health information. Despite the progress in natural language processing
for social media mining, a gap remains in analyzing health-related texts on
social discourse in the context of events. Event-driven analysis can offer
insights into different facets of healthcare at an individual and collective
level, including treatment options, misconceptions, knowledge gaps, etc. This
paper presents a paradigm to characterize health-related information-seeking in
social discourse through the lens of events. Events here are board categories
defined with domain experts that capture the trajectory of the
treatment/medication. To illustrate the value of this approach, we analyze
Reddit posts regarding medications for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), a critical
global health concern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
to define event categories for characterizing information-seeking in OUD social
discourse. Guided by domain experts, we develop TREAT-ISE, a novel multilabel
treatment information-seeking event dataset to analyze online discourse on an
event-based framework. This dataset contains Reddit posts on
information-seeking events related to recovery from OUD, where each post is
annotated based on the type of events. We also establish a strong performance
benchmark (77.4% F1 score) for the task by employing several machine learning
and deep learning classifiers. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the
performance and errors of ChatGPT on this task, providing valuable insights
into the LLM's capabilities and ongoing characterization efforts.

<p class="mathjax">Analysts and scientists are interested in querying streams of video, audio,
and text to extract quantitative insights. For example, an urban planner may
wish to measure congestion by querying the live feed from a traffic camera.
Prior work has used deep neural networks (DNNs) to answer such queries in the
batch setting. However, much of this work is not suited for the streaming
setting because it requires access to the entire dataset before a query can be
submitted or is specific to video. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
work addresses the problem of efficiently answering queries over multiple
modalities of streams.
<br />In this work we propose InQuest, a system for accelerating aggregation
queries on unstructured streams of data with statistical guarantees on query
accuracy. InQuest leverages inexpensive approximation models ("proxies") and
sampling techniques to limit the execution of an expensive high-precision model
(an "oracle") to a subset of the stream. It then uses the oracle predictions to
compute an approximate query answer in real-time. We theoretically analyzed
InQuest and show that the expected error of its query estimates converges on
stationary streams at a rate inversely proportional to the oracle budget. We
evaluated our algorithm on six real-world video and text datasets and show that
InQuest achieves the same root mean squared error (RMSE) as two streaming
baselines with up to 5.0x fewer oracle invocations. We further show that
InQuest can achieve up to 1.9x lower RMSE at a fixed number of oracle
invocations than a state-of-the-art batch setting algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid expansion of foundation pre-trained models and their fine-tuned
counterparts has significantly contributed to the advancement of machine
learning. Leveraging pre-trained models to extract knowledge and expedite
learning in real-world tasks, known as "Model Reuse", has become crucial in
various applications. Previous research focuses on reusing models within a
certain aspect, including reusing model weights, structures, and hypothesis
spaces. This paper introduces ZhiJian, a comprehensive and user-friendly
toolbox for model reuse, utilizing the PyTorch backend. ZhiJian presents a
novel paradigm that unifies diverse perspectives on model reuse, encompassing
target architecture construction with PTM, tuning target model with PTM, and
PTM-based inference. This empowers deep learning practitioners to explore
downstream tasks and identify the complementary advantages among different
methods. ZhiJian is readily accessible at
https://github.com/zhangyikaii/lamda-zhijian facilitating seamless utilization
of pre-trained models and streamlining the model reuse process for researchers
and developers.

<p class="mathjax">Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) represents a promising solution for
decentralized learning in heterogeneous data environments. Partial model
personalization has been proposed to improve the efficiency of PFL by
selectively updating local model parameters instead of aggregating all of them.
However, previous work on partial model personalization has mainly focused on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leaving a gap in understanding how it can
be applied to other popular models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs). In this
work, we investigate where and how to partially personalize a ViT model.
Specifically, we empirically evaluate the sensitivity to data distribution of
each type of layer. Based on the insights that the self-attention layer and the
classification head are the most sensitive parts of a ViT, we propose a novel
approach called FedPerfix, which leverages plugins to transfer information from
the aggregated model to the local client as a personalization. Finally, we
evaluate the proposed approach on CIFAR-100, OrganAMNIST, and Office-Home
datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the model's performance
compared to several advanced PFL methods.

<p class="mathjax">Bulk email is widely used in organizations to communicate messages to
employees. It is an important tool in making employees aware of policies,
events, leadership updates, etc. However, in large organizations, the problem
of overwhelming communication is widespread. Ineffective organizational bulk
emails waste employees' time and organizations' money, and cause a lack of
awareness or compliance with organizations' missions and priorities. This
thesis focuses on improving organizational bulk email systems by 1) conducting
qualitative research to understand different stakeholders; 2) conducting field
studies to evaluate personalization's effects on getting employees to read bulk
messages; 3) designing tools to support communicators in evaluating bulk
emails. We performed these studies at the University of Minnesota, interviewing
25 employees (both senders and recipients), and including 317 participants in
total. We found that the university's current bulk email system is ineffective
as only 22% of the information communicated was retained by employees. To
encourage employees to read high-level information, we implemented a
multi-stakeholder personalization framework that mixed
important-to-organization messages with employee-preferred messages and
improved the studied bulk email's recognition rate by 20%. On the sender side,
we iteratively designed a prototype of a bulk email evaluation platform. In
field evaluation, we found bulk emails' message-level performance helped
communicators in designing bulk emails. We collected eye-tracking data and
developed a neural network technique to estimate how much time each message is
being read using recipients' interactions with browsers only, which improved
the estimation accuracy to 73%. In summary, this work sheds light on how to
design organizational bulk email systems that communicate effectively and
respect different stakeholders' value.

<p class="mathjax">In the prevailing convergence of traditional infrastructure-based deployment
(i.e., Telco and industry operational networks) towards evolving deployments
enabled by 5G and virtualization, there is a keen interest in elaborating
effective security controls to protect these deployments in-depth. By
considering key enabling technologies like 5G and virtualization, evolving
networks are democratized, facilitating the establishment of point presences
integrating different business models ranging from media, dynamic web content,
gaming, and a plethora of IoT use cases. Despite the increasing services
provided by evolving networks, many cybercrimes and attacks have been launched
in evolving networks to perform malicious activities. Due to the limitations of
traditional security artifacts (e.g., firewalls and intrusion detection
systems), the research on digital forensic data analytics has attracted more
attention. Digital forensic analytics enables people to derive detailed
information and comprehensive conclusions from different perspectives of
cybercrimes to assist in convicting criminals and preventing future crimes.
This chapter presents a digital analytics framework for network anomaly
detection, including multi-perspective feature engineering, unsupervised
anomaly detection, and comprehensive result correction procedures. Experiments
on real-world evolving network data show the effectiveness of the proposed
forensic data analytics solution.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have surpassed human
intelligence in a variety of computational tasks. However, AI systems, like
humans, make mistakes, have blind spots, hallucinate, and struggle to
generalize to new situations. This work explores whether AI can benefit from
creative decision-making mechanisms when pushed to the limits of its
computational rationality. In particular, we investigate whether a team of
diverse AI systems can outperform a single AI in challenging tasks by
generating more ideas as a group and then selecting the best ones. We study
this question in the game of chess, the so-called drosophila of AI. We build on
AlphaZero (AZ) and extend it to represent a league of agents via a
latent-conditioned architecture, which we call AZ_db. We train AZ_db to
generate a wider range of ideas using behavioral diversity techniques and
select the most promising ones with sub-additive planning. Our experiments
suggest that AZ_db plays chess in diverse ways, solves more puzzles as a group
and outperforms a more homogeneous team. Notably, AZ_db solves twice as many
challenging puzzles as AZ, including the challenging Penrose positions. When
playing chess from different openings, we notice that players in AZ_db
specialize in different openings, and that selecting a player for each opening
using sub-additive planning results in a 50 Elo improvement over AZ. Our
findings suggest that diversity bonuses emerge in teams of AI agents, just as
they do in teams of humans and that diversity is a valuable asset in solving
computationally hard problems.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative manipulation is inherently multimodal, with haptic
communication playing a central role. When performed by humans, it involves
back-and-forth force exchanges between the participants through which they
resolve possible conflicts and determine their roles. Much of the existing work
on collaborative human-robot manipulation assumes that the robot follows the
human. But for a robot to match the performance of a human partner it needs to
be able to take initiative and lead when appropriate. To achieve such
human-like performance, the robot needs to have the ability to (1) determine
the intent of the human, (2) clearly express its own intent, and (3) choose its
actions so that the dyad reaches consensus. This work proposes a framework for
recognizing human intent in collaborative manipulation tasks using force
exchanges. Grounded in a dataset collected during a human study, we introduce a
set of features that can be computed from the measured signals and report the
results of a classifier trained on our collected human-human interaction data.
Two metrics are used to evaluate the intent recognizer: overall accuracy and
the ability to correctly identify transitions. The proposed recognizer shows
robustness against the variations in the partner's actions and the confounding
effects due to the variability in grasp forces and dynamic effects of walking.
The results demonstrate that the proposed recognizer is well-suited for
implementation in a physical interaction control scheme.

<p class="mathjax">Loco-manipulation planning skills are pivotal for expanding the utility of
robots in everyday environments. These skills can be assessed based on a
system's ability to coordinate complex holistic movements and multiple contact
interactions when solving different tasks. However, existing approaches have
been merely able to shape such behaviors with hand-crafted state machines,
densely engineered rewards, or pre-recorded expert demonstrations. Here, we
propose a minimally-guided framework that automatically discovers whole-body
trajectories jointly with contact schedules for solving general
loco-manipulation tasks in pre-modeled environments. The key insight is that
multi-modal problems of this nature can be formulated and treated within the
context of integrated Task and Motion Planning (TAMP). An effective bilevel
search strategy is achieved by incorporating domain-specific rules and
adequately combining the strengths of different planning techniques: trajectory
optimization and informed graph search coupled with sampling-based planning. We
showcase emergent behaviors for a quadrupedal mobile manipulator exploiting
both prehensile and non-prehensile interactions to perform real-world tasks
such as opening/closing heavy dishwashers and traversing spring-loaded doors.
These behaviors are also deployed on the real system using a two-layer
whole-body tracking controller.

<p class="mathjax">Pruning has emerged as a powerful technique for compressing deep neural
networks, reducing memory usage and inference time without significantly
affecting overall performance. However, the nuanced ways in which pruning
impacts model behavior are not well understood, particularly for long-tailed,
multi-label datasets commonly found in clinical settings. This knowledge gap
could have dangerous implications when deploying a pruned model for diagnosis,
where unexpected model behavior could impact patient well-being. To fill this
gap, we perform the first analysis of pruning's effect on neural networks
trained to diagnose thorax diseases from chest X-rays (CXRs). On two large CXR
datasets, we examine which diseases are most affected by pruning and
characterize class "forgettability" based on disease frequency and
co-occurrence behavior. Further, we identify individual CXRs where uncompressed
and heavily pruned models disagree, known as pruning-identified exemplars
(PIEs), and conduct a human reader study to evaluate their unifying qualities.
We find that radiologists perceive PIEs as having more label noise, lower image
quality, and higher diagnosis difficulty. This work represents a first step
toward understanding the impact of pruning on model behavior in deep
long-tailed, multi-label medical image classification. All code, model weights,
and data access instructions can be found at

<p class="mathjax">The evolution of Generative AI and the capabilities of the newly released
Large Language Models (LLMs) open new opportunities in software engineering.
However, they also lead to new challenges in cybersecurity. Recently,
researchers have shown the possibilities of using LLMs such as ChatGPT to
generate malicious content that can directly be exploited or guide
inexperienced hackers to weaponize tools and code. Those studies covered
scenarios that still require the attacker in the middle of the loop. In this
study, we leverage openly available plugins and use an LLM as proxy between the
attacker and the victim. We deliver a proof-of-concept where ChatGPT is used
for the dissemination of malicious software while evading detection, alongside
establishing the communication to a command and control (C2) server to receive
commands to interact with a victim's system. Finally, we present the general
approach as well as essential elements in order to stay undetected and make the
attack a success. This proof-of-concept highlights significant cybersecurity
issues with openly available plugins and LLMs, which require the development of
security guidelines, controls, and mitigation strategies.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a corpus-based analysis of argument structure errors in
learner Chinese. The data for analysis includes sentences produced by language
learners as well as their corrections by native speakers. We couple the data
with semantic role labeling annotations that are manually created by two senior
students whose majors are both Applied Linguistics. The annotation procedure is
guided by the Chinese PropBank specification, which is originally developed to
cover first language phenomena. Nevertheless, we find that it is quite
comprehensive for handling second language phenomena. The inter-annotator
agreement is rather high, suggesting the understandability of learner texts to
native speakers. Based on our annotations, we present a preliminary analysis of
competence errors related to argument structure. In particular, speech errors
related to word order, word selection, lack of proposition, and
argument-adjunct confounding are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">We consider monotone variational inequality (VI) problems in multi-GPU
settings where multiple processors/workers/clients have access to local
stochastic dual vectors. This setting includes a broad range of important
problems from distributed convex minimization to min-max and games.
Extra-gradient, which is a de facto algorithm for monotone VI problems, has not
been designed to be communication-efficient. To this end, we propose a
quantized generalized extra-gradient (Q-GenX), which is an unbiased and
adaptive compression method tailored to solve VIs. We provide an adaptive
step-size rule, which adapts to the respective noise profiles at hand and
achieve a fast rate of ${\mathcal O}(1/T)$ under relative noise, and an
order-optimal ${\mathcal O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ under absolute noise and show
distributed training accelerates convergence. Finally, we validate our
theoretical results by providing real-world experiments and training generative
adversarial networks on multiple GPUs.

<p class="mathjax">Imitation learning methods are used to infer a policy in a Markov decision
process from a dataset of expert demonstrations by minimizing a divergence
measure between the empirical state occupancy measures of the expert and the
policy. The guiding signal to the policy is provided by the discriminator used
as part of an versarial optimization procedure. We observe that this model is
prone to absorbing spurious correlations present in the expert data. To
alleviate this issue, we propose to use causal invariance as a regularization
principle for adversarial training of these models. The regularization
objective is applicable in a straightforward manner to existing adversarial
imitation frameworks. We demonstrate the efficacy of the regularized
formulation in an illustrative two-dimensional setting as well as a number of
high-dimensional robot locomotion benchmark tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The potential of integrating public transit with ridesharing includes shorter
travel time for commuters and higher occupancy rate of personal vehicles and
public transit ridership. In this paper, we describe a centralized transit
system that integrates public transit and ridesharing to reduce travel time for
commuters. In the system, a set of ridesharing providers (drivers) and a set of
public transit riders are received. The optimization goal of the system is to
assign riders to drivers by arranging public transit and ridesharing combined
routes subject to shorter commuting time for as many riders as possible. We
give an exact algorithm, which is an ILP formulation based on a hypergraph
representation of the problem. By using the ILP and the hypergraph, we give
approximation algorithms based on LP-rounding and hypergraph matching/weighted
set packing, respectively. As a case study, we conduct an extensive
computational study based on real-world public transit dataset and ridesharing
dataset in Chicago city. To evaluate the effectiveness of the transit system
and our algorithms, we generate data instances from the datasets. The
experimental results show that more than 60% of riders are assigned to drivers
on average, riders' commuting time is reduced by 23% and vehicle occupancy rate
is improved to almost 3. Our proposed algorithms are efficient for practical
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Bug reports are an essential aspect of software development, and it is
crucial to identify and resolve them quickly to ensure the consistent
functioning of software systems. Retrieving similar bug reports from an
existing database can help reduce the time and effort required to resolve bugs.
In this paper, we compared the effectiveness of semantic textual similarity
methods for retrieving similar bug reports based on a similarity score. We
explored several embedding models such as TF-IDF (Baseline), FastText, Gensim,
BERT, and ADA. We used the Software Defects Data containing bug reports for
various software projects to evaluate the performance of these models. Our
experimental results showed that BERT generally outperformed the rest of the
models regarding recall, followed by ADA, Gensim, FastText, and TFIDF. Our
study provides insights into the effectiveness of different embedding methods
for retrieving similar bug reports and highlights the impact of selecting the
appropriate one for this task. Our code is available on GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Number of IoT enabled devices are being tried and introduced every year and
there is a healthy competition among researched and businesses to capitalize
the space created by IoT, as these devices have a great market potential.
Depending on the type of task involved and sensitive nature of data that the
device handles, various IoT architectures, communication protocols and
components are chosen and their performance is evaluated. This paper reviews
such IoT enabled devices based on their architecture, communication protocols
and functions in few key socially relevant fields like health care, farming,
firefighting, women/individual safety/call for help/harm alert, home
surveillance and mapping as these fields involve majority of the general
public. It can be seen, to one's amazement, that already significant number of
devices are being reported on these fields and their performance is promising.
This paper also outlines the challenges involved in each of these fields that
require solutions to make these devices reliable

<p class="mathjax">Message passing neural networks have shown a lot of success on
graph-structured data. However, there are many instances where message passing
can lead to over-smoothing or fail when neighboring nodes belong to different
classes. In this work, we introduce a simple yet general framework for
improving learning in message passing neural networks. Our approach essentially
upsamples edges in the original graph by adding "slow nodes" at each edge that
can mediate communication between a source and a target node. Our method only
modifies the input graph, making it plug-and-play and easy to use with existing
models. To understand the benefits of slowing down message passing, we provide
theoretical and empirical analyses. We report results on several supervised and
self-supervised benchmarks, and show improvements across the board, notably in
heterophilic conditions where adjacent nodes are more likely to have different
labels. Finally, we show how our approach can be used to generate augmentations
for self-supervised learning, where slow nodes are randomly introduced into
different edges in the graph to generate multi-scale views with variable path
lengths.

<p class="mathjax">It is shown that a class of optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can
be learned to arbitrary precision with arbitrarily high probability, even in
the presence of noise, given access to polynomially many challenge-response
pairs and polynomially bounded computational power, under mild assumptions
about the distributions of the noise and challenge vectors. This extends the
results of Rh\"uramir et al. (2013), who showed a subset of this class of PUFs
to be learnable in polynomial time in the absence of noise, under the
assumption that the optics of the PUF were either linear or had negligible
nonlinear effects. We derive polynomial bounds for the required number of
samples and the computational complexity of a linear regression algorithm,
based on size parameters of the PUF, the distributions of the challenge and
noise vectors, and the probability and accuracy of the regression algorithm,
with a similar analysis to one done by Bootle et al. (2018), who demonstrated a

<p class="mathjax">Training deep neural networks using backpropagation is very memory and
computationally intensive. This makes it difficult to run on-device learning or
fine-tune neural networks on tiny, embedded devices such as low-power
micro-controller units (MCUs). Sparse backpropagation algorithms try to reduce
the computational load of on-device learning by training only a subset of the
weights and biases. Existing approaches use a static number of weights to
train. A poor choice of this so-called backpropagation ratio limits either the
computational gain or can lead to severe accuracy losses. In this paper we
present TinyProp, the first sparse backpropagation method that dynamically
adapts the back-propagation ratio during on-device training for each training
step. TinyProp induces a small calculation overhead to sort the elements of the
gradient, which does not significantly impact the computational gains. TinyProp
works particularly well on fine-tuning trained networks on MCUs, which is a
typical use case for embedded applications. For typical datasets from three
datasets MNIST, DCASE2020 and CIFAR10, we are 5 times faster compared to
non-sparse training with an accuracy loss of on average 1%. On average,
TinyProp is 2.9 times faster than existing, static sparse backpropagation
algorithms and the accuracy loss is reduced on average by 6 % compared to a
typical static setting of the back-propagation ratio.

<p class="mathjax">Item representation holds significant importance in recommendation systems,
which encompasses domains such as news, retail, and videos. Retrieval and
ranking models utilise item representation to capture the user-item
relationship based on user behaviours. While existing representation learning
methods primarily focus on optimising item-based mechanisms, such as attention
and sequential modelling. However, these methods lack a modelling mechanism to
directly reflect user interests within the learned item representations.
Consequently, these methods may be less effective in capturing user interests
indirectly. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Interest-aware
Capsule network (IaCN) recommendation model, a model-agnostic framework that
directly learns interest-oriented item representations. IaCN serves as an
auxiliary task, enabling the joint learning of both item-based and
interest-based representations. This framework adopts existing recommendation
models without requiring substantial redesign. We evaluate the proposed
approach on benchmark datasets, exploring various scenarios involving different
deep neural networks, behaviour sequence lengths, and joint learning ratios of
interest-oriented item representations. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance enhancements across diverse recommendation models,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Simulation of wave propagation in poroelastic half-spaces presents a common
challenge in fields like geomechanics and biomechanics, requiring Absorbing
Boundary Conditions (ABCs) at the semi-infinite space boundaries. Perfectly
Matched Layers (PML) are a popular choice due to their excellent wave
absorption properties. However, PML implementation can lead to problems with
unknown stresses or strains, time convolutions, or PDE systems with Auxiliary
Differential Equations (ADEs), which increases computational complexity and
resource consumption.
<br />This article presents two new PML formulations for arbitrary poroelastic
domains. The first formulation is a fully-mixed form that employs time-history
variables instead of ADEs, reducing the number of unknowns and mathematical
operations. The second formulation is a hybrid form that restricts the
fully-mixed formulation to the PML domain, resulting in smaller matrices for
the solver while preserving governing equations in the interior domain. The
fully-mixed formulation introduces three scalar variables over the whole
domain, whereas the hybrid form confines them to the PML domain.
<br />The proposed formulations were tested in three numerical experiments in
geophysics using realistic parameters for soft sites with free surfaces. The
results were compared with numerical solutions from extended domains and
simpler ABCs, such as paraxial approximation, demonstrating the accuracy,
efficiency, and precision of the proposed methods. The article also discusses
the applicability of these methods to complex media and their extension to the
Multiaxial PML formulation.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional image stitching focuses on a single panorama frame without
considering the spatial-temporal consistency in videos. The straightforward
image stitching approach will cause temporal flicking and color inconstancy
when it is applied to the video stitching task. Besides, inaccurate camera
parameters will cause artifacts in the image warping. In this paper, we propose
a real-time system to stitch multiple video sequences into a panoramic video,
which is based on GPU accelerated color correction and frame warping without
accurate camera parameters. We extend the traditional 2D-Matrix (2D-M) color
correction approach and a present spatio-temporal 3D-Matrix (3D-M) color
correction method for the overlap local regions with online color balancing

homography matrices given by coarse camera calibration for global warping
followed by accurate local warping based on the optical flow. Experimental

<p class="mathjax">Graph alignment refers to the task of finding the vertex correspondence
between two positively correlated graphs. Extensive study has been done on
polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph pair model, where the two graphs are
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs with edge probability $q_\mathrm{u}$, correlated
under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact recovery of the vertex
correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge correlation
coefficient $\rho_\mathrm{u}$ between the two graphs to satisfy
$\rho_\mathrm{u} &gt; \sqrt{\alpha}$, where $\alpha \approx 0.338$ is Otter's
tree-counting constant. Moreover, it is conjectured in [1] that no
polynomial-time algorithm can achieve exact recovery under weak edge
correlation $\rho_\mathrm{u}&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$.
<br />In this paper, we show that with a vanishing amount of additional attribute
information, exact recovery is polynomial-time feasible under vanishing edge
correlation $\rho_\mathrm{u} \ge n^{-\Theta(1)}$. We identify a local tree
structure, which incorporates one layer of user information and one layer of
attribute information, and apply the subgraph counting technique to such
structures. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed that recovers the vertex
correspondence for all but a vanishing fraction of vertices. We then further
refine the algorithm output to achieve exact recovery. The motivation for
considering additional attribute information comes from the widely available
side information in real-world applications, such as the user's birthplace and
educational background on LinkedIn and Twitter social networks.

<p class="mathjax">A Man-in-the-Middle (MiM) can collect over-the-air packets whether from a
mobile or a base station, process them, possibly modify them, and forward them
to the intended receiver. This paper exhibits the REVEAL protocol that can
detect a MiM, whether it has half duplex capability, full duplex capability, or
double full duplex capability. Protocol is based on synchronizing clocks
between the mobile and the base station, with the MiM being detected if it
interferes in the synchronization process. Once synchronized, the REVEAL
protocol creates a sequence of challenge packets where the transmission times
of the packets, their durations, and their frequencies, are chosen to create
conflicts at the MiM, and make it impossible for the MiM to function. We
implement the REVEAL protocol for detecting a MiM in 4G technology. We
instantiate a MiM between the 4G/5G base station and a mobile, and exhibit the

<p class="mathjax">Developing effective Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is critical for many
applications requiring collaboration and coordination with humans. Despite the
rapid advance of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) in cooperative
MAS, one major challenge is the simultaneous learning and interaction of
independent agents in dynamic environments in the presence of stochastic
rewards. State-of-the-art MADRL models struggle to perform well in Coordinated
Multi-agent Object Transportation Problems (CMOTPs), wherein agents must
coordinate with each other and learn from stochastic rewards. In contrast,
humans often learn rapidly to adapt to nonstationary environments that require
coordination among people. In this paper, motivated by the demonstrated ability
of cognitive models based on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) to capture
human decisions in many dynamic decision making tasks, we propose three
variants of Multi-Agent IBL models (MAIBL). The idea of these MAIBL algorithms
is to combine the cognitive mechanisms of IBLT and the techniques of MADRL
models to deal with coordination MAS in stochastic environments from the
perspective of independent learners. We demonstrate that the MAIBL models
exhibit faster learning and achieve better coordination in a dynamic CMOTP task
with various settings of stochastic rewards compared to current MADRL models.
We discuss the benefits of integrating cognitive insights into MADRL models.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation (classification) of Earth Observation imagery is a
crucial task in remote sensing. This paper presents a comprehensive review of
technical factors to consider when designing neural networks for this purpose.
The review focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and transformer
models, discussing prominent design patterns for these ANN families and their
implications for semantic segmentation. Common pre-processing techniques for
ensuring optimal data preparation are also covered. These include methods for
image normalization and chipping, as well as strategies for addressing data
imbalance in training samples, and techniques for overcoming limited data,
including augmentation techniques, transfer learning, and domain adaptation. By
encompassing both the technical aspects of neural network design and the
data-related considerations, this review provides researchers and practitioners
with a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the factors involved in
designing effective neural networks for semantic segmentation of Earth
Observation imagery.

<p class="mathjax">Modern 'smart' materials have complex heterogeneous microscale structure,
often with unknown macroscale closure but one we need to realise for large
scale engineering and science. The multiscale Equation-Free Patch Scheme
empowers us to non-intrusively, efficiently, and accurately predict the large
scale, system level, solutions through computations on only small sparse
patches of the given detailed microscale system. Here the microscale system is
that of a 2D beam of heterogeneous elasticity, with either fixed fixed,
fixed-free, or periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the described
multiscale Patch Scheme simply, efficiently, and stably predicts the beam's
macroscale, with a controllable accuracy, at finite scale separation. Dynamical
systems theory supports the scheme. This article points the way for others to
use this systematic non-intrusive approach, via a developing toolbox of
functions, to model and compute accurately macroscale system-levels of general
complex physical and engineering systems.

<p class="mathjax">A common architectural choice for deep metric learning is a convolutional
neural network followed by global average pooling (GAP). Albeit simple, GAP is
a highly effective way to aggregate information. One possible explanation for
the effectiveness of GAP is considering each feature vector as representing a
different semantic entity and GAP as a convex combination of them. Following
this perspective, we generalize GAP and propose a learnable generalized sum
pooling method (GSP). GSP improves GAP with two distinct abilities: i) the
ability to choose a subset of semantic entities, effectively learning to ignore
nuisance information, and ii) learning the weights corresponding to the
importance of each entity. Formally, we propose an entropy-smoothed optimal
transport problem and show that it is a strict generalization of GAP, i.e., a
specific realization of the problem gives back GAP. We show that this
optimization problem enjoys analytical gradients enabling us to use it as a
direct learnable replacement for GAP. We further propose a zero-shot loss to
ease the learning of GSP. We show the effectiveness of our method with
extensive evaluations on 4 popular metric learning benchmarks. Code is
available at: GSP-DML Framework

<p class="mathjax">In the current knowledge economy, knowledge represents the most strategically
significant resource of organizations. Knowledge-intensive activities advance
innovation and create and sustain economic rent and competitive advantage. In
order to sustain competitive advantage, organizations must protect knowledge
from leakage to third parties, particularly competitors. However, the number
and scale of leakage incidents reported in news media as well as industry
whitepapers suggests that modern organizations struggle with the protection of
sensitive data and organizational knowledge. The increasing use of mobile
devices and technologies by knowledge workers across the organizational
perimeter has dramatically increased the attack surface of organizations, and
the corresponding level of risk exposure. While much of the literature has
focused on technology risks that lead to information leakage, human risks that
lead to knowledge leakage are relatively understudied. Further, not much is
known about strategies to mitigate the risk of knowledge leakage using mobile
devices, especially considering the human aspect. Specifically, this research
study identified three gaps in the current literature (1) lack of in-depth
studies that provide specific strategies for knowledge-intensive organizations
based on their varied risk levels. Most of the analysed studies provide
high-level strategies that are presented in a generalised manner and fail to
identify specific strategies for different organizations and risk levels. (2)
lack of research into management of knowledge in the context of mobile devices.
And (3) lack of research into the tacit dimension of knowledge as the majority
of the literature focuses on formal and informal strategies to protect explicit
(codified) knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, deep face recognition methods have demonstrated impressive
results on in-the-wild datasets. However, these methods have shown a
significant decline in performance when applied to real-world low-resolution
benchmarks like TinyFace or SCFace. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel classification consistency knowledge distillation approach that transfers
the learned classifier from a high-resolution model to a low-resolution
network. This approach helps in finding discriminative representations for
low-resolution instances. To further improve the performance, we designed a
knowledge distillation loss using the adaptive angular penalty inspired by the
success of the popular angular margin loss function. The adaptive penalty
reduces overfitting on low-resolution samples and alleviates the convergence
issue of the model integrated with data augmentation. Additionally, we utilize
an asymmetric cross-resolution learning approach based on the state-of-the-art
semi-supervised representation learning paradigm to improve discriminability on
low-resolution instances and prevent them from forming a cluster. Our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on low-resolution benchmarks,
with a three percent improvement on TinyFace while maintaining performance on
high-resolution benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel Hadamard integrator for the self-adjoint time-dependent
wave equation in an inhomogeneous medium. First, we create a new asymptotic
series based on the Gelfand-Shilov function, dubbed Hadamard's ansatz, to
approximate the Green's function of the time-dependent wave equation. Second,
incorporating the leading term of Hadamard's ansatz into the Kirchhoff-Huygens
representation, we develop an original Hadamard integrator for the Cauchy
problem of the time-dependent wave equation and derive the corresponding
Lagrangian formulation in geodesic polar coordinates. Third, to construct the
Hadamard integrator in the Lagrangian formulation efficiently, we use a
short-time ray tracing method to obtain wavefront locations accurately, and we
further develop fast algorithms to compute Chebyshev-polynomial based low-rank
representations of both wavefront locations and variants of Hadamard
coefficients. Fourth, equipped with these low-rank representations, we apply
the Hadamard integrator to efficiently solve time-dependent wave equations with
highly oscillatory initial conditions, where the time step size is independent
of the initial conditions. By judiciously choosing the medium-dependent time
step, our new Hadamard integrator can propagate wave field beyond caustics
implicitly and advance spatially overturning waves in time naturally. Moreover,
since the integrator is independent of initial conditions, the Hadamard
integrator can be applied to many different initial conditions once it is
constructed. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical examples
illustrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable success in face
recognition (FR), partly due to the abundant data availability. However, the
current training benchmarks exhibit an imbalanced quality distribution; most
images are of high quality. This poses issues for generalization on hard
samples since they are underrepresented during training. In this work, we
employ the multi-model boosting technique to deal with this issue. Inspired by
the well-known AdaBoost, we propose a sample-level weighting approach to
incorporate the importance of different samples into the FR loss. Individual
models of the proposed framework are experts at distinct levels of sample
hardness. Therefore, the combination of models leads to a robust feature
extractor without losing the discriminability on the easy samples. Also, for
incorporating the sample hardness into the training criterion, we analytically
show the effect of sample mining on the important aspects of current angular
margin loss functions, i.e., margin and scale. The proposed method shows
superior performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms in
extensive experiments on the CFP-FP, LFW, CPLFW, CALFW, AgeDB, TinyFace, IJB-B,
and IJB-C evaluation datasets.

misused to update the legitimate vehicular status maliciously. As investigated,
the existing centralized false data detection approach based on state and
likelihood estimation has a reprehensible trade-off in terms of accuracy,
trust, cost, and efficiency. Blockchain with Fuzzy-logic Intelligence has shown
its potential to solve localisation issues, trust and false data detection
challenges encountered by today's autonomous vehicular system. The proposed
Blockchain-based fuzzy solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and
reputation preservation technique. The illustrated proposed model filters false
and anomalous data based on the vehicles' rules and behaviours. Besides
improving the detection accuracy and eliminating the single point of failure,
the contributions include appropriating fuzzy AI functions within the Road-side
Unit node before authorizing status data by a Blockchain network. Finally,
thorough experimental evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed
model.

<p class="mathjax">The aquaculture sector in New Zealand is experiencing rapid expansion, with a
particular emphasis on mussel exports. As the demands of mussel farming
operations continue to evolve, the integration of artificial intelligence and
computer vision techniques, such as intelligent object detection, is emerging
as an effective approach to enhance operational efficiency. This study delves
into advancing buoy detection by leveraging deep learning methodologies for
intelligent mussel farm monitoring and management. The primary objective
centers on improving accuracy and robustness in detecting buoys across a
spectrum of real-world scenarios. A diverse dataset sourced from mussel farms
is captured and labeled for training, encompassing imagery taken from cameras
mounted on both floating platforms and traversing vessels, capturing various
lighting and weather conditions. To establish an effective deep learning model
for buoy detection with a limited number of labeled data, we employ transfer
learning techniques. This involves adapting a pre-trained object detection
model to create a specialized deep learning buoy detection model. We explore
different pre-trained models, including YOLO and its variants, alongside data
diversity to investigate their effects on model performance. Our investigation
demonstrates a significant enhancement in buoy detection performance through
deep learning, accompanied by improved generalization across diverse weather
conditions, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Mutation-based fuzzing is popular and effective in discovering unseen code
and exposing bugs. However, only a few studies have concentrated on quantifying
the importance of input bytes, which refers to the degree to which a byte
contributes to the discovery of new code. They often focus on obtaining the
relationship between input bytes and path constraints, ignoring the fact that
not all constraint-related bytes can discover new code. In this paper, we
conduct Shapely analysis to understand the effect of byte positions on fuzzing
performance, and find that some byte positions contribute more than others and
this property often holds across seeds. Based on this observation, we propose a
novel fuzzing solution, ShapFuzz, to guide byte selection and mutation.
Specifically, ShapFuzz updates Shapley values (importance) of bytes when each
input is tested during fuzzing with a low overhead, and utilizes contextual
multi-armed bandit to trade off between mutating high Shapley value bytes and
low-frequently chosen bytes. We implement a prototype of this solution based on
AFL++, i.e., ShapFuzz. We evaluate ShapFuzz against ten state-of-the-art
fuzzers, including five byte schedule-reinforced fuzzers and five commonly used
fuzzers. Compared with byte schedule-reinforced fuzzers, ShapFuzz discovers
more edges and exposes more bugs than the best baseline on three different sets
of initial seeds. Compared with commonly used fuzzers, ShapFuzz exposes 20 more
bugs than the best comparison fuzzer, and discovers 6 more CVEs than the best
baseline on MAGMA. Furthermore, ShapFuzz discovers 11 new bugs on the latest
versions of programs, and 3 of them are confirmed by vendors.

<p class="mathjax">Recent sparse detectors with multiple, e.g. six, decoder layers achieve
promising performance but much inference time due to complex heads. Previous
works have explored using dense priors as initialization and built
one-decoder-layer detectors. Although they gain remarkable acceleration, their
performance still lags behind their six-decoder-layer counterparts by a large
margin. In this work, we aim to bridge this performance gap while retaining
fast speed. We find that the architecture discrepancy between dense and sparse
detectors leads to feature conflict, hampering the performance of
one-decoder-layer detectors. Thus we propose Adaptive Sparse Anchor Generator
(ASAG) which predicts dynamic anchors on patches rather than grids in a sparse
way so that it alleviates the feature conflict problem. For each image, ASAG
dynamically selects which feature maps and which locations to predict, forming
a fully adaptive way to generate image-specific anchors. Further, a simple and
effective Query Weighting method eases the training instability from
adaptiveness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
dense-initialized ones and achieves a better speed-accuracy trade-off. The code
is available at \url{https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/ASAG}.

<p class="mathjax">Camera-based 3D object detection in BEV (Bird's Eye View) space has drawn
great attention over the past few years. Dense detectors typically follow a
two-stage pipeline by first constructing a dense BEV feature and then
performing object detection in BEV space, which suffers from complex view
transformations and high computation cost. On the other side, sparse detectors
follow a query-based paradigm without explicit dense BEV feature construction,
but achieve worse performance than the dense counterparts. In this paper, we
find that the key to mitigate this performance gap is the adaptability of the
detector in both BEV and image space. To achieve this goal, we propose
SparseBEV, a fully sparse 3D object detector that outperforms the dense
counterparts. SparseBEV contains three key designs, which are (1)
scale-adaptive self attention to aggregate features with adaptive receptive
field in BEV space, (2) adaptive spatio-temporal sampling to generate sampling
locations under the guidance of queries, and (3) adaptive mixing to decode the
sampled features with dynamic weights from the queries. On the test split of
nuScenes, SparseBEV achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 67.5 NDS. On
the val split, SparseBEV achieves 55.8 NDS while maintaining a real-time
inference speed of 23.5 FPS. Code is available at
https://github.com/MCG-NJU/SparseBEV.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the community has made tremendous progress in developing effective
methods for point cloud video understanding that learn from massive amounts of
labeled data. However, annotating point cloud videos is usually notoriously
expensive. Moreover, training via one or only a few traditional tasks (e.g.,
classification) may be insufficient to learn subtle details of the
spatio-temporal structure existing in point cloud videos. In this paper, we
propose a Masked Spatio-Temporal Structure Prediction (MaST-Pre) method to
capture the structure of point cloud videos without human annotations. MaST-Pre
is based on spatio-temporal point-tube masking and consists of two
self-supervised learning tasks. First, by reconstructing masked point tubes,
our method is able to capture the appearance information of point cloud videos.
Second, to learn motion, we propose a temporal cardinality difference
prediction task that estimates the change in the number of points within a
point tube. In this way, MaST-Pre is forced to model the spatial and temporal
structure in point cloud videos. Extensive experiments on MSRAction-3D,
NTU-RGBD, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a unified point cloud video self-supervised learning framework for
object-centric and scene-centric data. Previous methods commonly conduct
representation learning at the clip or frame level and cannot well capture
fine-grained semantics. Instead of contrasting the representations of clips or
frames, in this paper, we propose a unified self-supervised framework by
conducting contrastive learning at the point level. Moreover, we introduce a
new pretext task by achieving semantic alignment of superpoints, which further
facilitates the representations to capture semantic cues at multiple scales. In
addition, due to the high redundancy in the temporal dimension of dynamic point
clouds, directly conducting contrastive learning at the point level usually
leads to massive undesired negatives and insufficient modeling of positive
representations. To remedy this, we propose a selection strategy to retain
proper negatives and make use of high-similarity samples from other instances
as positive supplements. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
supervised counterparts on a wide range of downstream tasks and demonstrates
the superior transferability of the learned representations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper serves as a starting point for machine learning researchers,
engineers and students who are interested in but not yet familiar with causal
inference. We start by laying out an important set of assumptions that are
collectively needed for causal identification, such as exchangeability,
positivity, consistency and the absence of interference. From these
assumptions, we build out a set of important causal inference techniques, which
we do so by categorizing them into two buckets; active and passive approaches.
We describe and discuss randomized controlled trials and bandit-based
approaches from the active category. We then describe classical approaches,
such as matching and inverse probability weighting, in the passive category,
followed by more recent deep learning based algorithms. By finishing the paper
with some of the missing aspects of causal inference from this paper, such as
collider biases, we expect this paper to provide readers with a diverse set of
starting points for further reading and research in causal inference and
discovery.

<p class="mathjax">Point-cloud-based 3D perception has attracted great attention in various
applications including robotics, autonomous driving and AR/VR. In particular,
the 3D sparse convolution (SpConv) network has emerged as one of the most
popular backbones due to its excellent performance. However, it poses severe
challenges to real-time perception on general-purpose platforms, such as
lengthy map search latency, high computation cost, and enormous memory
footprint. In this paper, we propose SpOctA, a SpConv accelerator that enables
high-speed and energy-efficient point cloud processing. SpOctA parallelizes the
map search by utilizing algorithm-architecture co-optimization based on octree
encoding, thereby achieving 8.8-21.2x search speedup. It also attenuates the
heavy computational workload by exploiting inherent sparsity of each voxel,
which eliminates computation redundancy and saves 44.4-79.1% processing
latency. To optimize on-chip memory management, a SpConv-oriented non-uniform
caching strategy is introduced to reduce external memory access energy by 57.6%
on average. Implemented on a 40nm technology and extensively evaluated on
representative benchmarks, SpOctA rivals the state-of-the-art SpConv
accelerators by 1.1-6.9x speedup with 1.5-3.1x energy efficiency improvement.

<p class="mathjax">We study the representation capacity of deep hyperbolic neural networks
(HNNs) with a ReLU activation function. We establish the first proof that HNNs
can $\varepsilon$-isometrically embed any finite weighted tree into a
hyperbolic space of dimension $d$ at least equal to $2$ with prescribed
sectional curvature $\kappa&lt;0$, for any $\varepsilon&gt; 1$ (where $\varepsilon=1$
being optimal). We establish rigorous upper bounds for the network complexity
on an HNN implementing the embedding. We find that the network complexity of
HNN implementing the graph representation is independent of the representation
fidelity/distortion. We contrast this result against our lower bounds on
distortion which any ReLU multi-layer perceptron (MLP) must exert when
embedding a tree with $L&gt;2^d$ leaves into a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space,
which we show at least $\Omega(L^{1/d})$; independently of the depth, width,

<p class="mathjax">Microservice architecture gains momentum by fueling systems with cloud-native
benefits, scalability, and decentralized evolution. However, new challenges
emerge for end-to-end (E2E) testing. Testers who see the decentralized system
through the user interface might assume their tests are comprehensive, covering
all middleware endpoints scattered across microservices. However, they do not
have instruments to verify such assumptions. This paper introduces test
coverage metrics for evaluating the extent of E2E test suite coverage for
microservice endpoints. Next, it presents an automated approach to compute
these metrics to provide feedback on the completeness of E2E test suites.
Furthermore, a visual perspective is provided to highlight test coverage across
the system's microservices to guide on gaps in test suites. We implement a
proof-of-concept tool and perform a case study on a well-established system
benchmark showing it can generate conclusive feedback on test suite coverage
over system endpoints.

<p class="mathjax">Due to inappropriate sample selection and limited training data, a
distribution shift often exists between the training and test sets. This shift
can adversely affect the test performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Existing approaches mitigate this issue by either enhancing the robustness of
GNNs to distribution shift or reducing the shift itself. However, both
approaches necessitate retraining the model, which becomes unfeasible when the
model structure and parameters are inaccessible. To address this challenge, we
propose FR-GNN, a general framework for GNNs to conduct feature reconstruction.
FRGNN constructs a mapping relationship between the output and input of a
well-trained GNN to obtain class representative embeddings and then uses these
embeddings to reconstruct the features of labeled nodes. These reconstructed
features are then incorporated into the message passing mechanism of GNNs to
influence the predictions of unlabeled nodes at test time. Notably, the
reconstructed node features can be directly utilized for testing the
well-trained model, effectively reducing the distribution shift and leading to
improved test performance. This remarkable achievement is attained without any
modifications to the model structure or parameters. We provide theoretical
guarantees for the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on various public datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of FRGNN in comparison to mainstream
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Regime-switching poses both problems and opportunities for portfolio
managers. If a switch in the behaviour of the markets is not quickly detected
it can be a source of loss, since previous trading positions may be
inappropriate in the new regime. However, if a regime-switch can be detected
quickly, and especially if it can be predicted ahead of time, these changes in
market behaviour can instead be a source of substantial profit. The work of
this paper builds on two previous works by the authors, the first of these
dealing with regime detection and the second, which is an extension of the
first, with regime prediction. Specifically, this work uses our previous
regime-prediction model (KMRF) within a framework of multi-period portfolio
optimisation, achieved by model predictive control, (MPC), with the
KMRF-derived return estimates accuracy-boosted by means of a novel use of a
Kalman filter. The resulting proposed model, which we term the KMRF+MPC model,
to reflect its constituent methodologies, is demonstrated to outperform
industry-standard benchmarks, even though it is restricted, in order to be
acceptable to the widest range of investors, to long-only positions.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study a numerical artifact of solving the nonlinear shallow
water equations with a discontinuous bottom topography. For various first-order
schemes, the numerical solution of the momentum will form a spurious spike at
the discontinuous points of the bottom, which should not exist in the exact
solution. The height of the spike cannot be reduced even after the mesh is
refined. For subsonic problems, this numerical artifact may cause the wrong
convergence to a function far away from the exact solution. To explain the
formation of the spurious spike, we perform a convergence analysis by proving a
Lax--Wendroff type theorem. It is shown that the spurious spike is caused by
the numerical viscosity in the computation of the water height at the
discontinuous bottom. The height of the spike is proportional to the magnitude
of the viscosity constant in the Lax--Friedrichs flux. Motivated by this
conclusion, we propose a modified scheme by adopting the central flux at the
bottom discontinuity in the equation of mass conservation, and show that this
numerical artifact can be removed in many cases. For various numerical tests
with nontransonic Riemann solutions, we observe that the modified scheme is
able to retrieve the correct convergence.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning
capabilities, particularly when guided by specifically designed prompts in
complex reasoning tasks such as math word problems. These models typically
solve tasks using a chain-of-thought approach, which not only bolsters their
reasoning abilities but also provides valuable insights into their
problem-solving process. However, there is still significant room for enhancing
the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Some studies suggest that the integration of
an LLM output verifier can boost reasoning accuracy without necessitating
additional model training. In this paper, we follow these studies and introduce
a novel graph-based method to further augment the reasoning capabilities of
LLMs. We posit that multiple solutions to a reasoning task, generated by an
LLM, can be represented as a reasoning graph due to the logical connections
between intermediate steps from different reasoning paths. Therefore, we
propose the Reasoning Graph Verifier (RGV) to analyze and verify the solutions
generated by LLMs. By evaluating these graphs, models can yield more accurate
and reliable results.Our experimental results show that our graph-based
verification method not only significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of
LLMs but also outperforms existing verifier methods in terms of improving these
models' reasoning performance.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel framework, Action Progression Network (APN), for temporal
action detection (TAD) in videos. The framework locates actions in videos by
detecting the action evolution process. To encode the action evolution, we
quantify a complete action process into 101 ordered stages (0\%, 1\%, ...,
100\%), referred to as action progressions. We then train a neural network to
recognize the action progressions. The framework detects action boundaries by
detecting complete action processes in the videos, e.g., a video segment with
detected action progressions closely follow the sequence 0\%, 1\%, ..., 100\%.
The framework offers three major advantages: (1) Our neural networks are
trained end-to-end, contrasting conventional methods that optimize modules
separately; (2) The APN is trained using action frames exclusively, enabling
models to be trained on action classification datasets and robust to videos
with temporal background styles differing from those in training; (3) Our
framework effectively avoids detecting incomplete actions and excels in
detecting long-lasting actions due to the fine-grained and explicit encoding of
the temporal structure of actions. Leveraging these advantages, the APN
achieves competitive performance and significantly surpasses its counterparts
in detecting long-lasting actions. With an IoU threshold of 0.5, the APN
achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 58.3\% on the THUMOS14 dataset and
98.9\% mAP on the DFMAD70 dataset.

mappings between function spaces. However, DNOs face the challenge of increased
dimensionality and computational cost associated with unaligned observation
data. In this study, we propose a hybrid Decoder-DeepONet operator regression
framework to handle unaligned data effectively. Additionally, we introduce a
Multi-Decoder-DeepONet, which utilizes an average field of training data as
input augmentation. The consistencies of the frameworks with the operator
approximation theory are provided, on the basis of the universal approximation
theorem. Two numerical experiments, Darcy problem and flow-field around an
airfoil, are conducted to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
methods. Results illustrate the advantages of Decoder-DeepONet and
Multi-Decoder-DeepONet in handling unaligned observation data and showcase
their potentials in improving prediction accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Social pressure is a key factor affecting the evolution of opinions on
networks in many types of settings, pushing people to conform to their
neighbors' opinions. To study this, the interacting Polya urn model was
introduced by Jadbabaie et al., in which each agent has two kinds of opinion:
inherent beliefs, which are hidden from the other agents and fixed; and
declared opinions, which are randomly sampled at each step from a distribution
which depends on the agent's inherent belief and her neighbors' past declared
opinions (the social pressure component), and which is then communicated to
their neighbors. Each agent also has a bias parameter denoting her level of
resistance to social pressure. At every step, the agents simultaneously update
their declared opinions according to their neighbors' aggregate past declared
opinions, their inherent beliefs, and their bias parameters. We study the
asymptotic behavior of this opinion dynamics model and show that agents'
declaration probabilities converge almost surely in the limit using Lyapunov
theory and stochastic approximation techniques. We also derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for the agents to approach consensus on their declared
opinions. Our work provides further insight into the difficulty of inferring
the inherent beliefs of agents when they are under social pressure.

the PACE (Pacing According to Current Estimated utility) algorithm, an existing
algorithm designed for stochastic input. We show that in the equal-budgets
case, PACE is equivalent to the integral greedy algorithm. We go on to show
that with natural restrictions on the adversarial input model, both integral
greedy allocation and PACE have asymptotically bounded multiplicative envy as
well as competitive ratio for Nash welfare, with the multiplicative factors
either constant or with optimal order dependence on the number of agents. This
completes a "best-of-many-worlds" guarantee for PACE, since past work showed

<p class="mathjax">Based on powerful text-to-image diffusion models, text-to-3D generation has
made significant progress in generating compelling geometry and appearance.
However, existing methods still struggle to recover high-fidelity object
materials, either only considering Lambertian reflectance, or failing to
disentangle BRDF materials from the environment lights. In this work, we
propose Material-Aware Text-to-3D via LAtent BRDF auto-EncodeR
(\textbf{MATLABER}) that leverages a novel latent BRDF auto-encoder for
material generation. We train this auto-encoder with large-scale real-world
BRDF collections and ensure the smoothness of its latent space, which
implicitly acts as a natural distribution of materials. During appearance
modeling in text-to-3D generation, the latent BRDF embeddings, rather than BRDF
parameters, are predicted via a material network. Through exhaustive
experiments, our approach demonstrates the superiority over existing ones in
generating realistic and coherent object materials. Moreover, high-quality
materials naturally enable multiple downstream tasks such as relighting and
material editing. Code and model will be publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Existing unsupervised low-light image enhancement methods lack enough
effectiveness and generalization in practical applications. We suppose this is
because of the absence of explicit supervision and the inherent gap between
real-world scenarios and the training data domain. In this paper, we develop
Diffusion-based domain calibration to realize more robust and effective
unsupervised Low-Light Enhancement, called DiffLLE. Since the diffusion model
performs impressive denoising capability and has been trained on massive clean
images, we adopt it to bridge the gap between the real low-light domain and
training degradation domain, while providing efficient priors of real-world
content for unsupervised models. Specifically, we adopt a naive unsupervised
enhancement algorithm to realize preliminary restoration and design two
zero-shot plug-and-play modules based on diffusion model to improve
generalization and effectiveness. The Diffusion-guided Degradation Calibration
(DDC) module narrows the gap between real-world and training low-light
degradation through diffusion-based domain calibration and a lightness
enhancement curve, which makes the enhancement model perform robustly even in
sophisticated wild degradation. Due to the limited enhancement effect of the
unsupervised model, we further develop the Fine-grained Target domain
Distillation (FTD) module to find a more visual-friendly solution space. It
exploits the priors of the pre-trained diffusion model to generate
pseudo-references, which shrinks the preliminary restored results from a coarse
normal-light domain to a finer high-quality clean field, addressing the lack of
strong explicit supervision for unsupervised methods. Benefiting from these,
our approach even outperforms some supervised methods by using only a simple
unsupervised baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
effectiveness of the proposed DiffLLE.

<p class="mathjax">Deep co-training has been introduced to semi-supervised segmentation and
achieves impressive results, yet few studies have explored the working
mechanism behind it. In this work, we revisit the core assumption that supports
co-training: multiple compatible and conditionally independent views. By
theoretically deriving the generalization upper bound, we prove the prediction
similarity between two models negatively impacts the model's generalization
ability. However, most current co-training models are tightly coupled together
and violate this assumption. Such coupling leads to the homogenization of
networks and confirmation bias which consequently limits the performance. To
this end, we explore different dimensions of co-training and systematically
increase the diversity from the aspects of input domains, different
augmentations and model architectures to counteract homogenization. Our Diverse
Co-training outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin
across different evaluation protocols on the Pascal and Cityscapes. For
example. we achieve the best mIoU of 76.2%, 77.7% and 80.2% on Pascal with only
92, 183 and 366 labeled images, surpassing the previous best results by more

<p class="mathjax">Many problems in static program analysis can be modeled as the context-free
language (CFL) reachability problem on directed labeled graphs. The CFL
reachability problem can be generally solved in time $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the
number of vertices in the graph, with some specific cases that can be solved
faster. In this work, we ask the following question: given a specific CFL, what
is the exact exponent in the monomial of the running time? In other words, for
which cases do we have linear, quadratic or cubic algorithms, and are there
problems with intermediate runtimes? This question is inspired by recent
efforts to classify classic problems in terms of their exact polynomial
complexity, known as {\em fine-grained complexity}. Although recent efforts
have shown some conditional lower bounds (mostly for the class of combinatorial
algorithms), a general picture of the fine-grained complexity landscape for CFL
reachability is missing.
<br />Our main contribution is lower bound results that pinpoint the exact running
time of several classes of CFLs or specific CFLs under widely believed lower
bound conjectures (Boolean Matrix Multiplication and $k$-Clique). We
particularly focus on the family of Dyck-$k$ languages (which are strings with
well-matched parentheses), a fundamental class of CFL reachability problems. We
present new lower bounds for the case of sparse input graphs where the number
of edges $m$ is the input parameter, a common setting in the database
literature. For this setting, we show a cubic lower bound for Andersen's
Pointer Analysis which significantly strengthens prior known results.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of the image generation technologies, the
malicious abuses of the GAN-generated fingerprint images poses a significant
threat to the public safety in certain circumstances. Although the existing
universal deep forgery detection approach can be applied to detect the fake
fingerprint images, they are easily attacked and have poor robustness.
Meanwhile, there is no specifically designed deep forgery detection method for
fingerprint images. In this paper, we propose the first deep forgery detection
approach for fingerprint images, which combines unique ridge features of
fingerprint and generation artifacts of the GAN-generated images, to the best
of our knowledge. Specifically, we firstly construct a ridge stream, which
exploits the grayscale variations along the ridges to extract unique
fingerprint-specific features. Then, we construct a generation artifact stream,
in which the FFT-based spectrums of the input fingerprint images are exploited,
to extract more robust generation artifact features. At last, the unique ridge
features and generation artifact features are fused for binary classification
(\textit{i.e.}, real or fake). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed approach is effective and robust with low complexities.

<p class="mathjax">The game industry is challenged to cope with increasing growth in demand and
game complexity while maintaining acceptable quality standards for released
games. Classic approaches solely depending on human efforts for quality
assurance and game testing do not scale effectively in terms of time and cost.
Game-testing AI agents that learn by interaction with the environment have the
potential to mitigate these challenges with good scalability properties on time
and costs. However, most recent work in this direction depends on game state
information for the agent's state representation, which limits generalization
across different game scenarios. Moreover, game test engineers usually prefer
exploring a game in a specific style, such as exploring the golden path.
However, current game testing AI agents do not provide an explicit way to
satisfy such a preference. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing
an agent design that mainly depends on pixel-based state observations while
exploring the environment conditioned on a user's preference specified by
demonstration trajectories. In addition, we propose an imitation learning
method that couples self-supervised and supervised learning objectives to
enhance the quality of imitation behaviors. Our agent significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art pixel-based game testing agents over exploration coverage and
test execution quality when evaluated on a complex open-world environment
resembling many aspects of real AAA games.

<p class="mathjax">Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely used to develop
neural surrogates for solutions of Partial Differential Equations. A drawback
of PINNs is that they have to be retrained with every change in
initial-boundary conditions and PDE coefficients. The Hypernetwork, a
model-based meta learning technique, takes in a parameterized task embedding as
input and predicts the weights of PINN as output. Predicting weights of a
neural network however, is a high-dimensional regression problem, and
hypernetworks perform sub-optimally while predicting parameters for large base
networks. To circumvent this issue, we use a low ranked adaptation (LoRA)
formulation to decompose every layer of the base network into low-ranked
tensors and use hypernetworks to predict the low-ranked tensors. Despite the
reduced dimensionality of the resulting weight-regression problem, LoRA-based
Hypernetworks violate the underlying physics of the given task. We demonstrate
that the generalization capabilities of LoRA-based hypernetworks drastically
improve when trained with an additional physics-informed loss component
(HyperPINN) to satisfy the governing differential equations. We observe that
LoRA-based HyperPINN training allows us to learn fast solutions for
parameterized PDEs like Burger's equation and Navier Stokes: Kovasznay flow,
while having an 8x reduction in prediction parameters on average without
compromising on accuracy when compared to all other baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems (RecSys) rely on learning
representations for users and items to predict preferences accurately.
Representation learning on the hypersphere is a promising approach due to its
desirable properties, such as alignment and uniformity. However, the sparsity
issue arises when it encounters RecSys. To address this issue, we propose a
novel approach, graph-based alignment and uniformity (GraphAU), that explicitly
considers high-order connectivities in the user-item bipartite graph. GraphAU
aligns the user/item embedding to the dense vector representations of
high-order neighbors using a neighborhood aggregator, eliminating the need to
compute the burdensome alignment to high-order neighborhoods individually. To
address the discrepancy in alignment losses, GraphAU includes a layer-wise
alignment pooling module to integrate alignment losses layer-wise. Experiments
on four datasets show that GraphAU significantly alleviates the sparsity issue
and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We open-source GraphAU at
https://github.com/YangLiangwei/GraphAU.

<p class="mathjax">Simulating physical systems using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) has
become an indispensible part of modern industrial process optimization.
Traditionally, numerical solvers have been used to solve the associated PDEs,
however recently Transform-based Neural Operators such as the Fourier Neural
Operator and Wavelet Neural Operator have received a lot of attention for their
potential to provide fast solutions for systems of PDEs. In this work, we
investigate the importance of the transform layers to the reported success of
transform based neural operators. In particular, we record the cost in terms of
performance, if all the transform layers are replaced by learnable linear
layers. Surprisingly, we observe that linear layers suffice to provide
performance comparable to the best-known transform-based layers and seem to do
so with a compute time advantage as well. We believe that this observation can
have significant implications for future work on Neural Operators, and might
point to other sources of efficiencies for these architectures.

<p class="mathjax">The key to the success of few-shot segmentation (FSS) lies in how to
effectively utilize support samples. Most solutions compress support foreground
(FG) features into prototypes, but lose some spatial details. Instead, others
use cross attention to fuse query features with uncompressed support FG. Query
FG could be fused with support FG, however, query background (BG) cannot find
matched BG features in support FG, yet inevitably integrates dissimilar
features. Besides, as both query FG and BG are combined with support FG, they
get entangled, thereby leading to ineffective segmentation. To cope with these
issues, we design a self-calibrated cross attention (SCCA) block. For efficient
patch-based attention, query and support features are firstly split into
patches. Then, we design a patch alignment module to align each query patch
with its most similar support patch for better cross attention. Specifically,
SCCA takes a query patch as Q, and groups the patches from the same query image
and the aligned patches from the support image as K&amp;V. In this way, the query
BG features are fused with matched BG features (from query patches), and thus
the aforementioned issues will be mitigated. Moreover, when calculating SCCA,
we design a scaled-cosine mechanism to better utilize the support features for
similarity calculation. Extensive experiments conducted on PASCAL-5^i and
COCO-20^i demonstrate the superiority of our model, e.g., the mIoU score under
5-shot setting on COCO-20^i is 5.6%+ better than previous state-of-the-arts.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Learning Approach
for Time Series Anomaly Detection (CARLA), an innovative end-to-end
self-supervised framework carefully developed to identify anomalous patterns in
both univariate and multivariate time series data. By taking advantage of
contrastive representation learning, We introduce an innovative end-to-end
self-supervised deep learning framework carefully developed to identify
anomalous patterns in both univariate and multivariate time series data. By
taking advantage of contrastive representation learning, CARLA effectively
generates robust representations for time series windows. It achieves this by
1) learning similar representations for temporally close windows and dissimilar
representations for windows and their equivalent anomalous windows and 2)
employing a self-supervised approach to classify normal/anomalous
representations of windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours in the
representation space. Most of the existing models focus on learning normal
behaviour. The normal boundary is often tightly defined, which can result in
slight deviations being classified as anomalies, resulting in a high false
positive rate and limited ability to generalise normal patterns. CARLA's
contrastive learning methodology promotes the production of highly consistent
and discriminative predictions, thereby empowering us to adeptly address the
inherent challenges associated with anomaly detection in time series data.
Through extensive experimentation on 7 standard real-world time series anomaly
detection benchmark datasets, CARLA demonstrates F1 and AU-PR superior to
existing state-of-the-art results. Our research highlights the immense
potential of contrastive representation learning in advancing the field of time
series anomaly detection, thus paving the way for novel applications and
in-depth exploration in this domain.

<p class="mathjax">Catastrophic forgetting; the loss of old knowledge upon acquiring new
knowledge, is a pitfall faced by deep neural networks in real-world
applications. Many prevailing solutions to this problem rely on storing
exemplars (previously encountered data), which may not be feasible in
applications with memory limitations or privacy constraints. Therefore, the
recent focus has been on Non-Exemplar based Class Incremental Learning (NECIL)
where a model incrementally learns about new classes without using any past
exemplars. However, due to the lack of old data, NECIL methods struggle to
discriminate between old and new classes causing their feature representations
to overlap. We propose NAPA-VQ: Neighborhood Aware Prototype Augmentation with
Vector Quantization, a framework that reduces this class overlap in NECIL. We
draw inspiration from Neural Gas to learn the topological relationships in the
feature space, identifying the neighboring classes that are most likely to get
confused with each other. This neighborhood information is utilized to enforce
strong separation between the neighboring classes as well as to generate old
class representative prototypes that can better aid in obtaining a
discriminative decision boundary between old and new classes. Our comprehensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset demonstrate that
NAPA-VQ outperforms the State-of-the-art NECIL methods by an average
improvement of 5%, 2%, and 4% in accuracy and 10%, 3%, and 9% in forgetting
respectively. Our code can be found in https://github.com/TamashaM/NAPA-VQ.git.

<p class="mathjax">Building artificial intelligence (AI) systems on top of a set of foundation
models (FMs) is becoming a new paradigm in AI research. Their representative
and generative abilities learnt from vast amounts of data can be easily adapted
and transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks without extra training from
scratch. However, leveraging FMs in cross-modal generation remains
under-researched when audio modality is involved. On the other hand,
automatically generating semantically-relevant sound from visual input is an
important problem in cross-modal generation studies. To solve this
vision-to-audio (V2A) generation problem, existing methods tend to design and
build complex systems from scratch using modestly sized datasets. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight solution to this problem by leveraging
foundation models, specifically CLIP, CLAP, and AudioLDM. We first investigate
the domain gap between the latent space of the visual CLIP and the auditory
CLAP models. Then we propose a simple yet effective mapper mechanism
(V2A-Mapper) to bridge the domain gap by translating the visual input between
CLIP and CLAP spaces. Conditioned on the translated CLAP embedding, pretrained
audio generative FM AudioLDM is adopted to produce high-fidelity and
visually-aligned sound. Compared to previous approaches, our method only
requires a quick training of the V2A-Mapper. We further analyze and conduct
extensive experiments on the choice of the V2A-Mapper and show that a
generative mapper is better at fidelity and variability (FD) while a regression
mapper is slightly better at relevance (CS). Both objective and subjective
evaluation on two V2A datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
method compared to current state-of-the-art approaches - trained with 86% fewer
parameters but achieving 53% and 19% improvement in FD and CS, respectively.

functions for learning tasks that involve complex action sequencing. However,
no algorithm currently exists for learning reward machines with realistic weak

guarantees. REMAP introduces preference queries in place of membership queries
in the L* algorithm, and leverages a symbolic observation table along with
unification and constraint solving to narrow the hypothesis reward machine
search space. In addition to the proofs of correctness and termination for
REMAP, we present empirical evidence measuring correctness: how frequently the

and the regret between the ground truth and learned reward machines.

<p class="mathjax">Robust audio anti-spoofing has been increasingly challenging due to the
recent advancements on deepfake techniques. While spectrograms have
demonstrated their capability for anti-spoofing, complementary information
presented in multi-order spectral patterns have not been well explored, which
limits their effectiveness for varying spoofing attacks. Therefore, we propose
a novel deep learning method with a spectral fusion-reconstruction strategy,
namely S2pecNet, to utilise multi-order spectral patterns for robust audio
anti-spoofing representations. Specifically, spectral patterns up to
second-order are fused in a coarse-to-fine manner and two branches are designed
for the fine-level fusion from the spectral and temporal contexts. A
reconstruction from the fused representation to the input spectrograms further
reduces the potential fused information loss. Our method achieved the
state-of-the-art performance with an EER of 0.77% on a widely used dataset:
ASVspoof2019 LA Challenge.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning aims to learn a model from a continuous stream of data,
but it mainly assumes a fixed number of data and tasks with clear task
boundaries. However, in real-world scenarios, the number of input data and
tasks is constantly changing in a statistical way, not a static way. Although
recently introduced incremental learning scenarios having blurry task
boundaries somewhat address the above issues, they still do not fully reflect
the statistical properties of real-world situations because of the fixed ratio
of disjoint and blurry samples. In this paper, we propose a new Stochastic
incremental Blurry task boundary scenario, called Si-Blurry, which reflects the
stochastic properties of the real-world. We find that there are two major
challenges in the Si-Blurry scenario: (1) inter- and intra-task forgettings and
(2) class imbalance problem. To alleviate them, we introduce Mask and Visual
Prompt tuning (MVP). In MVP, to address the inter- and intra-task forgetting
issues, we propose a novel instance-wise logit masking and contrastive visual
prompt tuning loss. Both of them help our model discern the classes to be
learned in the current batch. It results in consolidating the previous
knowledge. In addition, to alleviate the class imbalance problem, we introduce
a new gradient similarity-based focal loss and adaptive feature scaling to ease
overfitting to the major classes and underfitting to the minor classes.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed MVP significantly outperforms the
existing state-of-the-art methods in our challenging Si-Blurry scenario.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose P3D, the human part-wise motion context learning
framework for sign language recognition. Our main contributions lie in two
dimensions: learning the part-wise motion context and employing the pose
ensemble to utilize 2D and 3D pose jointly. First, our empirical observation
implies that part-wise context encoding benefits the performance of sign
language recognition. While previous methods of sign language recognition
learned motion context from the sequence of the entire pose, we argue that such
methods cannot exploit part-specific motion context. In order to utilize
part-wise motion context, we propose the alternating combination of a part-wise
encoding Transformer (PET) and a whole-body encoding Transformer (WET). PET
encodes the motion contexts from a part sequence, while WET merges them into a
unified context. By learning part-wise motion context, our P3D achieves
superior performance on WLASL compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
Second, our framework is the first to ensemble 2D and 3D poses for sign
language recognition. Since the 3D pose holds rich motion context and depth
information to distinguish the words, our P3D outperformed the previous
state-of-the-art methods employing a pose ensemble.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, large-scale diffusion models, e.g., Stable diffusion and DallE2,
have shown remarkable results on image synthesis. On the other hand,
large-scale cross-modal pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, ALIGN, and FILIP) are
competent for various downstream tasks by learning to align vision and language
embeddings. In this paper, we explore the possibility of jointly modeling
generation and discrimination. Specifically, we propose DiffDis to unify the
cross-modal generative and discriminative pretraining into one single framework
under the diffusion process. DiffDis first formulates the image-text
discriminative problem as a generative diffusion process of the text embedding
from the text encoder conditioned on the image. Then, we propose a novel
dual-stream network architecture, which fuses the noisy text embedding with the
knowledge of latent images from different scales for image-text discriminative
learning. Moreover, the generative and discriminative tasks can efficiently
share the image-branch network structure in the multi-modality model.
Benefiting from diffusion-based unified training, DiffDis achieves both better
generation ability and cross-modal semantic alignment in one architecture.
Experimental results show that DiffDis outperforms single-task models on both
the image generation and the image-text discriminative tasks, e.g., 1.65%
improvement on average accuracy of zero-shot classification over 12 datasets
and 2.42 improvement on FID of zero-shot image synthesis.

<p class="mathjax">Image forgery detection aims to detect and locate forged regions in an image.
Most existing forgery detection algorithms formulate classification problems to
classify pixels into forged or pristine. However, the definition of forged and
pristine pixels is only relative within one single image, e.g., a forged region
in image A is actually a pristine one in its source image B (splicing forgery).
Such a relative definition has been severely overlooked by existing methods,
which unnecessarily mix forged (pristine) regions across different images into
the same category. To resolve this dilemma, we propose the FOrensic ContrAstive
cLustering (FOCAL) method, a novel, simple yet very effective paradigm based on
contrastive learning and unsupervised clustering for the image forgery
detection. Specifically, FOCAL 1) utilizes pixel-level contrastive learning to
supervise the high-level forensic feature extraction in an image-by-image
manner, explicitly reflecting the above relative definition; 2) employs an
on-the-fly unsupervised clustering algorithm (instead of a trained one) to
cluster the learned features into forged/pristine categories, further
suppressing the cross-image influence from training data; and 3) allows to
further boost the detection performance via simple feature-level concatenation
without the need of retraining. Extensive experimental results over six public
testing datasets demonstrate that our proposed FOCAL significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art competing algorithms by big margins: +24.3% on Coverage,
+18.6% on Columbia, +17.5% on FF++, +14.2% on MISD, +13.5% on CASIA and +10.3%
on NIST in terms of IoU. The paradigm of FOCAL could bring fresh insights and
serve as a novel benchmark for the image forgery detection task. The code is
available at https://github.com/HighwayWu/FOCAL.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing point-of-interest (POI) recommenders aim to capture user
preference by employing city-level user historical check-ins, thus facilitating
users' exploration of the city. However, the scarcity of city-level user
check-ins brings a significant challenge to user preference learning. Although
prior studies attempt to mitigate this challenge by exploiting various context
information, e.g., spatio-temporal information, they ignore to transfer the
knowledge (i.e., common behavioral pattern) from other relevant cities (i.e.,
auxiliary cities). In this paper, we investigate the effect of knowledge
distilled from auxiliary cities and thus propose a novel Meta-learning Enhanced
next POI Recommendation framework (MERec). The MERec leverages the correlation
of check-in behaviors among various cities into the meta-learning paradigm to
help infer user preference in the target city, by holding the principle of
"paying more attention to more correlated knowledge". Particularly, a
city-level correlation strategy is devised to attentively capture common
patterns among cities, so as to transfer more relevant knowledge from more
correlated cities. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the proposed
MERec against state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel lip reading framework, especially for
low-resource languages, which has not been well addressed in the previous
literature. Since low-resource languages do not have enough video-text paired
data to train the model to have sufficient power to model lip movements and
language, it is regarded as challenging to develop lip reading models for
low-resource languages. In order to mitigate the challenge, we try to learn
general speech knowledge, the ability to model lip movements, from a
high-resource language through the prediction of speech units. It is known that
different languages partially share common phonemes, thus general speech
knowledge learned from one language can be extended to other languages. Then,
we try to learn language-specific knowledge, the ability to model language, by
proposing Language-specific Memory-augmented Decoder (LMDecoder). LMDecoder
saves language-specific audio features into memory banks and can be trained on
audio-text paired data which is more easily accessible than video-text paired
data. Therefore, with LMDecoder, we can transform the input speech units into
language-specific audio features and translate them into texts by utilizing the
learned rich language knowledge. Finally, by combining general speech knowledge
and language-specific knowledge, we can efficiently develop lip reading models
even for low-resource languages. Through extensive experiments using five
languages, English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese, the effectiveness
of the proposed method is evaluated.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in code
completion. However, due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge, they may not
be optimal in completing code that requires intensive domain knowledge for
example completing the library names. Although there are several works that
have confirmed the effectiveness of fine-tuning techniques to adapt language
models for code completion in specific domains. They are limited by the need
for constant fine-tuning of the model when the project is in constant
iteration.
<br />To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose $k$NM-LM, a
retrieval-augmented language model (R-LM), that integrates domain knowledge
into language models without fine-tuning. Different from previous techniques,
our approach is able to automatically adapt to different language models and
domains. Specifically, it utilizes the in-domain code to build the
retrieval-based database decoupled from LM, and then combines it with LM
through Bayesian inference to complete the code. The extensive experiments on
the completion of intra-project and intra-scenario have confirmed that $k$NM-LM
brings about appreciable enhancements when compared to CodeGPT and UnixCoder. A
deep analysis of our tool including the responding speed, storage usage,
specific type code completion, and API invocation completion has confirmed that
$k$NM-LM provides satisfactory performance, which renders it highly appropriate
for domain adaptive code completion. Furthermore, our approach operates without
the requirement for direct access to the language model's parameters. As a
result, it can seamlessly integrate with black-box code completion models,
making it easy to integrate our approach as a plugin to further enhance the
performance of these models.

<p class="mathjax">Learning per-point semantic features from the hierarchical feature pyramid is
essential for point cloud semantic segmentation. However, most previous methods
suffered from ambiguous region features or failed to refine per-point features
effectively, which leads to information loss and ambiguous semantic
identification. To resolve this, we propose Retro-FPN to model the per-point
feature prediction as an explicit and retrospective refining process, which
goes through all the pyramid layers to extract semantic features explicitly for
each point. Its key novelty is a retro-transformer for summarizing semantic
contexts from the previous layer and accordingly refining the features in the
current stage. In this way, the categorization of each point is conditioned on
its local semantic pattern. Specifically, the retro-transformer consists of a
local cross-attention block and a semantic gate unit. The cross-attention
serves to summarize the semantic pattern retrospectively from the previous
layer. And the gate unit carefully incorporates the summarized contexts and
refines the current semantic features. Retro-FPN is a pluggable neural network
that applies to hierarchical decoders. By integrating Retro-FPN with three
representative backbones, including both point-based and voxel-based methods,
we show that Retro-FPN can significantly improve performance over
state-of-the-art backbones. Comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks
can justify the effectiveness of our design. The source is available at

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning is used to train a shared model in a decentralized way
without clients sharing private data with each other. Federated learning
systems are susceptible to poisoning attacks when malicious clients send false
updates to the central server. Existing defense strategies are ineffective
under non-IID data settings. This paper proposes a new defense strategy, FedCPA
(Federated learning with Critical Parameter Analysis). Our attack-tolerant
aggregation method is based on the observation that benign local models have
similar sets of top-k and bottom-k critical parameters, whereas poisoned local
models do not. Experiments with different attack scenarios on multiple datasets
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing defense strategies in defending
against poisoning attacks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses distributed robust learning-based control for consensus
formation tracking of multiple underwater vessels, in which the system
parameters of the marine vessels are assumed to be entirely unknown and subject
to the modeling mismatch, oceanic disturbances, and noises. Towards this end,
graph theory is used to allow us to synthesize the distributed controller with
a stability guarantee. Due to the fact that the parameter uncertainties only
arise in the vessels' dynamic model, the backstepping control technique is then
employed. Subsequently, to overcome the difficulties in handling time-varying
and unknown systems, an online learning procedure is developed in the proposed
distributed formation control protocol. Moreover, modeling errors,
environmental disturbances, and measurement noises are considered and tackled
by introducing a neurodynamics model in the controller design to obtain a
robust solution. Then, the stability analysis of the overall closed-loop system
under the proposed scheme is provided to ensure the robust adaptive performance
at the theoretical level. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are
conducted to further verify the efficacy of the presented distributed control
protocol.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has made significant strides in video understanding tasks, but
the computation required to classify lengthy and massive videos using
clip-level video classifiers remains impractical and prohibitively expensive.
To address this issue, we propose Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN), which
leverages the commonly available audio and visual modalities to efficiently
process the spatio-temporally important parts of a video. AVGN firstly divides
the video into snippets of image-audio clip pair and employs lightweight
unimodal encoders to extract global visual features and audio features. To
identify the important temporal segments, we use an Audio-Visual Temporal
Saliency Transformer (AV-TeST) that estimates the saliency scores of each
frame. To further increase efficiency in the spatial dimension, AVGN processes
only the important patches instead of the whole images. We use an
Audio-Enhanced Spatial Patch Attention (AESPA) module to produce a set of
enhanced coarse visual features, which are fed to a policy network that
produces the coordinates of the important patches. This approach enables us to
focus only on the most important spatio-temporally parts of the video, leading
to more efficient video recognition. Moreover, we incorporate various training
techniques and multi-modal feature fusion to enhance the robustness and
effectiveness of our AVGN. By combining these strategies, our AVGN sets new
state-of-the-art performance in multiple video recognition benchmarks while
achieving faster processing speed.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid progress of modern computing systems has led to a growing interest
in informative run-time logs. Various log-based anomaly detection techniques
have been proposed to ensure software reliability. However, their
implementation in the industry has been limited due to the lack of high-quality
public log resources as training datasets.
<br />While some log datasets are available for anomaly detection, they suffer from
limitations in (1) comprehensiveness of log events; (2) scalability over
diverse systems; and (3) flexibility of log utility. To address these
limitations, we propose AutoLog, the first automated log generation methodology
for anomaly detection. AutoLog uses program analysis to generate run-time log
sequences without actually running the system. AutoLog starts with probing
comprehensive logging statements associated with the call graphs of an
application. Then, it constructs execution graphs for each method after pruning
the call graphs to find log-related execution paths in a scalable manner.
Finally, AutoLog propagates the anomaly label to each acquired execution path
based on human knowledge. It generates flexible log sequences by walking along
the log execution paths with controllable parameters. Experiments on 50 popular
Java projects show that AutoLog acquires significantly more (9x-58x) log events
than existing log datasets from the same system, and generates log messages
much faster (15x) with a single machine than existing passive data collection
approaches. We hope AutoLog can facilitate the benchmarking and adoption of
automated log analysis techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Robust constrained formation tracking control of underactuated underwater
vehicles (UUVs) fleet in three-dimensional space is a challenging but practical
problem. To address this problem, this paper develops a novel consensus based
optimal coordination protocol and a robust controller, which adopts a
hierarchical architecture. On the top layer, the spherical coordinate transform
is introduced to tackle the nonholonomic constraint, and then a distributed
optimal motion coordination strategy is developed. As a result, the optimal
formation tracking of UUVs fleet can be achieved, and the constraints are
fulfilled. To realize the generated optimal commands better and, meanwhile,
deal with the underactuation, at the lower-level control loop a neurodynamics
based robust backstepping controller is designed, and in particular, the issue
of "explosion of terms" appearing in conventional backstepping based
controllers is avoided and control activities are improved. The stability of
the overall UUVs formation system is established to ensure that all the states
of the UUVs are uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of unknown
disturbances. Finally, extensive simulation comparisons are made to illustrate
the superiority and effectiveness of the derived optimal formation tracking
protocol.

<p class="mathjax">Dark videos often lose essential information, which causes the knowledge
learned by networks is not enough to accurately recognize actions. Existing
knowledge assembling methods require massive GPU memory to distill the
knowledge from multiple teacher models into a student model. In action
recognition, this drawback becomes serious due to much computation required by
video process. Constrained by limited computation source, these approaches are
infeasible. To address this issue, we propose an unlimited knowledge
distillation (UKD) in this paper. Compared with existing knowledge assembling
methods, our UKD can effectively assemble different knowledge without
introducing high GPU memory consumption. Thus, the number of teaching models
for distillation is unlimited. With our UKD, the network's learned knowledge
can be remarkably enriched. Our experiments show that the single stream network
distilled with our UKD even surpasses a two-stream network. Extensive
experiments are conducted on the ARID dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection is an essential task in the medical
field, as ADRs have a gravely detrimental impact on patients' health and the
healthcare system. Due to a large number of people sharing information on
social media platforms, an increasing number of efforts focus on social media
data to carry out effective ADR detection. Despite having achieved impressive
performance, the existing methods of ADR detection still suffer from three main
challenges. Firstly, researchers have consistently ignored the interaction
between domain keywords and other words in the sentence. Secondly, social media
datasets suffer from the challenges of low annotated data. Thirdly, the issue
of sample imbalance is commonly observed in social media datasets. To solve
these challenges, we propose the Knowledge Enhanced Shallow and Deep
Transformer(KESDT) model for ADR detection. Specifically, to cope with the
first issue, we incorporate the domain keywords into the Transformer model
through a shallow fusion manner, which enables the model to fully exploit the
interactive relationships between domain keywords and other words in the
sentence. To overcome the low annotated data, we integrate the synonym sets
into the Transformer model through a deep fusion manner, which expands the size
of the samples. To mitigate the impact of sample imbalance, we replace the
standard cross entropy loss function with the focal loss function for effective
model training. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets
including TwiMed, Twitter, and CADEC. The proposed KESDT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on F1 values, with relative improvements of 4.87%,
47.83%, and 5.73% respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposed KESDT.

<p class="mathjax">Multimedia compression allows us to watch videos, see pictures and hear
sounds within a limited bandwidth, which helps the flourish of the internet.
During the past decades, multimedia compression has achieved great success
using hand-craft features and systems. With the development of artificial
intelligence and video compression, there emerges a lot of research work
related to using the neural network on the video compression task to get rid of
the complicated system. Not only producing the advanced algorithms, but
researchers also spread the compression to different content, such as User
Generated Content(UGC). With the rapid development of mobile devices, screen
content videos become an important part of multimedia data. In contrast, we
find community lacks a large-scale dataset for screen content video
compression, which impedes the fast development of the corresponding
learning-based algorithms. In order to fulfill this blank and accelerate the
research of this special type of videos, we propose the Large-scale Screen
Content Dataset(LSCD), which contains 714 source sequences. Meanwhile, we
provide the analysis of the proposed dataset to show some features of screen
content videos, which will help researchers have a better understanding of how
to explore new algorithms. Besides collecting and post-processing the data to
organize the dataset, we also provide a benchmark containing the performance of
both traditional codec and learning-based methods.

<p class="mathjax">Creating test collections for offline retrieval evaluation requires human
effort to judge documents' relevance. This expensive activity motivated much
work in developing methods for constructing benchmarks with fewer assessment
costs. In this respect, adjudication methods actively decide both which
documents and the order in which experts review them, in order to better
exploit the assessment budget or to lower it. Researchers evaluate the quality
of those methods by measuring the correlation between the known gold ranking of
systems under the full collection and the observed ranking of systems under the
lower-cost one. This traditional analysis ignores whether and how the low-cost
judgements impact on the statistically significant differences among systems
with respect to the full collection. We fill this void by proposing a novel
methodology to evaluate how the low-cost adjudication methods preserve the
pairwise significant differences between systems as the full collection. In
other terms, while traditional approaches look for stability in answering the
question "is system A better than system B?", our proposed approach looks for
stability in answering the question "is system A significantly better than
system B?", which is the ultimate questions researchers need to answer to
guarantee the generalisability of their results. Among other results, we found
that the best methods in terms of ranking of systems correlation do not always
match those preserving statistical significance.

The objective of DA is to reduce the manual effort during the generation of
documents by automatically creating and integrating input from different
sources and assembling documents conforming to defined templates. There have
been reviews of commercial solutions of DA, particularly in the legal domain,
but to date there has been no comprehensive review of the academic research on
DA architectures and technologies. The current survey of DA reviews the
academic literature and provides a clearer definition and characterization of
DA and its features, identifies state-of-the-art DA architectures and

<p class="mathjax">Surprise Machines is a project of experimental museology that sets out to
visualize the entire image collection of the Harvard Art Museums, intending to
open up unexpected vistas on more than 200,000 objects usually inaccessible to
visitors. Part of the exhibition Curatorial A(i)gents organized by metaLAB (at)
Harvard, the project explores the limits of artificial intelligence to display
a large set of images and create surprise among visitors. To achieve such a
feeling of surprise, a choreographic interface was designed to connect the
audience's movement with several unique views of the collection.

<p class="mathjax">Class prototype construction and matching are core aspects of few-shot action
recognition. Previous methods mainly focus on designing spatiotemporal relation
modeling modules or complex temporal alignment algorithms. Despite the
promising results, they ignored the value of class prototype construction and
matching, leading to unsatisfactory performance in recognizing similar
categories in every task. In this paper, we propose GgHM, a new framework with
Graph-guided Hybrid Matching. Concretely, we learn task-oriented features by
the guidance of a graph neural network during class prototype construction,
optimizing the intra- and inter-class feature correlation explicitly. Next, we
design a hybrid matching strategy, combining frame-level and tuple-level
matching to classify videos with multivariate styles. We additionally propose a
learnable dense temporal modeling module to enhance the video feature temporal
representation to build a more solid foundation for the matching process. GgHM
shows consistent improvements over other challenging baselines on several
few-shot datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/jiazheng-xing/GgHM.

<p class="mathjax">Relational Language-Image Pre-training (RLIP) aims to align vision
representations with relational texts, thereby advancing the capability of
relational reasoning in computer vision tasks. However, hindered by the slow
convergence of RLIPv1 architecture and the limited availability of existing
scene graph data, scaling RLIPv1 is challenging. In this paper, we propose
RLIPv2, a fast converging model that enables the scaling of relational
pre-training to large-scale pseudo-labelled scene graph data. To enable fast
scaling, RLIPv2 introduces Asymmetric Language-Image Fusion (ALIF), a mechanism
that facilitates earlier and deeper gated cross-modal fusion with sparsified
language encoding layers. ALIF leads to comparable or better performance than
RLIPv1 in a fraction of the time for pre-training and fine-tuning. To obtain
scene graph data at scale, we extend object detection datasets with free-form
relation labels by introducing a captioner (e.g., BLIP) and a designed Relation
Tagger. The Relation Tagger assigns BLIP-generated relation texts to region
pairs, thus enabling larger-scale relational pre-training. Through extensive
experiments conducted on Human-Object Interaction Detection and Scene Graph
Generation, RLIPv2 shows state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks under
fully-finetuning, few-shot and zero-shot settings. Notably, the largest RLIPv2
achieves 23.29mAP on HICO-DET without any fine-tuning, yields 32.22mAP with
just 1% data and yields 45.09mAP with 100% data. Code and models are publicly
available at https://github.com/JacobYuan7/RLIPv2.

<p class="mathjax">Materials language processing (MLP) is one of the key facilitators of
materials science research, as it enables the extraction of structured
information from massive materials science literature. Prior works suggested
high-performance MLP models for text classification, named entity recognition
(NER), and extractive question answering (QA), which require complex model
architecture, exhaustive fine-tuning and a large number of human-labelled
datasets. In this study, we develop generative pretrained transformer
(GPT)-enabled pipelines where the complex architectures of prior MLP models are
replaced with strategic designs of prompt engineering. First, we develop a
GPT-enabled document classification method for screening relevant documents,
achieving comparable accuracy and reliability compared to prior models, with
only small dataset. Secondly, for NER task, we design an entity-centric
prompts, and learning few-shot of them improved the performance on most of
entities in three open datasets. Finally, we develop an GPT-enabled extractive
QA model, which provides improved performance and shows the possibility of
automatically correcting annotations. While our findings confirm the potential
of GPT-enabled MLP models as well as their value in terms of reliability and
practicability, our scientific methods and systematic approach are applicable
to any materials science domain to accelerate the information extraction of
scientific literature.

<p class="mathjax">Constrained image splicing detection and localization (CISDL) is a
fundamental task of multimedia forensics, which detects splicing operation
between two suspected images and localizes the spliced region on both images.
Recent works regard it as a deep matching problem and have made significant
progress. However, existing frameworks typically perform feature extraction and
correlation matching as separate processes, which may hinder the model's
ability to learn discriminative features for matching and can be susceptible to
interference from ambiguous background pixels. In this work, we propose a
multi-scale target-aware framework to couple feature extraction and correlation
matching in a unified pipeline. In contrast to previous methods, we design a
target-aware attention mechanism that jointly learns features and performs
correlation matching between the probe and donor images. Our approach can
effectively promote the collaborative learning of related patches, and perform
mutual promotion of feature learning and correlation matching. Additionally, in
order to handle scale transformations, we introduce a multi-scale projection
method, which can be readily integrated into our target-aware framework that
enables the attention process to be conducted between tokens containing
information of varying scales. Our experiments demonstrate that our model,
which uses a unified pipeline, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several
benchmark datasets and is robust against scale transformations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the transmit energy beamforming in a multi-antenna
wireless power transfer (WPT) system, in which an access point (AP) equipped
with a uniform linear array (ULA) sends radio signals to wirelessly charge
multiple single-antenna energy receivers (ERs). Different from conventional
energy beamforming designs that require the AP to acquire the channel state
information (CSI) via training and feedback, we propose a new training-free
energy beamforming approach assisted by wireless radar sensing, which is
implemented based on the following two-stage protocol. In the first stage, the
AP performs wireless radar sensing to estimate the path gain and angle
parameters of the ERs for constructing the corresponding CSI. In the second
stage, the AP implements the transmit energy beamforming based on the
constructed CSI to efficiently charge these ERs in a fair manner. Under this
setup, first, we jointly optimize the sensing beamformers and duration in the
first stage to minimize the sensing duration, while ensuring a given accuracy
threshold for parameters estimation subject to the maximum transmit power
constraint at the AP. Next, we optimize the energy beamformers in the second
stage to maximize the minimum harvested energy by all ERs. In this approach,
the estimation accuracy threshold for the first stage is properly designed to
balance the resource allocation between the two stages for optimizing the
ultimate energy harvesting performance. Finally, numerical results show that
the proposed training-free energy beamforming design performs close to the
performance upper bound with perfect CSI, and outperforms the benchmark schemes
without such joint optimization and that with isotropic transmission.

<p class="mathjax">Major depressive disorder is a serious and heterogeneous psychiatric disorder
that needs accurate diagnosis. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), which
captures multiple perspectives on brain structure, function, and connectivity,
is increasingly applied in the diagnosis and pathological research of mental
diseases. Different machine learning algorithms are then developed to exploit
the rich information in rsfMRI and discriminate MDD patients from normal
controls. Despite recent advances reported, the discrimination accuracy has
room for further improvement. The generalizability and interpretability of the
method are not sufficiently addressed either. Here, we propose a machine
learning method (MFMC) for MDD discrimination by concatenating multiple
features and stacking multiple classifiers. MFMC is tested on the REST-meta-MDD
data set that contains 2428 subjects collected from 25 different sites. MFMC
yields 96.9% MDD discrimination accuracy, demonstrating a significant
improvement over existing methods. In addition, the generalizability of MFMC is
validated by the good performance when the training and testing subjects are
from independent sites. The use of XGBoost as the meta classifier allows us to
probe the decision process of MFMC. We identify 13 feature values related to 9
brain regions including the posterior cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus
orbital part, and angular gyrus, which contribute most to the classification
and also demonstrate significant differences at the group level. The use of
these 13 feature values alone can reach 87% of MFMC's full performance when
taking all feature values. These features may serve as clinically useful
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for mental disorders in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a challenging task that entails complex
multi-modal reasoning. In contrast to multiple-choice VideoQA which aims to
predict the answer given several options, the goal of open-ended VideoQA is to
answer questions without restricting candidate answers. However, the majority
of previous VideoQA models formulate open-ended VideoQA as a classification
task to classify the video-question pairs into a fixed answer set, i.e.,
closed-vocabulary, which contains only frequent answers (e.g., top-1000
answers). This leads the model to be biased toward only frequent answers and
fail to generalize on out-of-vocabulary answers. We hence propose a new
benchmark, Open-vocabulary Video Question Answering (OVQA), to measure the
generalizability of VideoQA models by considering rare and unseen answers. In
addition, in order to improve the model's generalization power, we introduce a
novel GNN-based soft verbalizer that enhances the prediction on rare and unseen
answers by aggregating the information from their similar words. For
evaluation, we introduce new baselines by modifying the existing
(closed-vocabulary) open-ended VideoQA models and improve their performances by
further taking into account rare and unseen answers. Our ablation studies and
qualitative analyses demonstrate that our GNN-based soft verbalizer further
improves the model performance, especially on rare and unseen answers. We hope
that our benchmark OVQA can serve as a guide for evaluating the
generalizability of VideoQA models and inspire future research. Code is
available at https://github.com/mlvlab/OVQA.

<p class="mathjax">Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in many domains.
Practically, the overlap between point clouds to be registered may be
relatively small. Most unsupervised methods lack effective initial evaluation
of overlap, leading to suboptimal registration accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose an unsupervised network Overlap Bias Matching Network (OBMNet) for
partial point cloud registration. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play
Overlap Bias Matching Module (OBMM) comprising two integral components, overlap
sampling module and bias prediction module. These two components are utilized
to capture the distribution of overlapping regions and predict bias
coefficients of point cloud common structures, respectively. Then, we integrate
OBMM with the neighbor map matching module to robustly identify correspondences
by precisely merging matching scores of points within the neighborhood, which
addresses the ambiguities in single-point features. OBMNet can maintain
efficacy even in pair-wise registration scenarios with low overlap ratios.
Experimental results on extensive datasets demonstrate that our approach's
performance achieves a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art
registration approach.

<p class="mathjax">In the last several years, wireless Battery Management Systems (BMS) have
slowly become a topic of interest from both academia and industry. It came from
a necessity derived from the increased production and use in different systems,
including the electrical vehicles. Wireless communication allows for a more
flexible and cost-efficient sensor installation in battery packs. However, many
wireless technologies, such as those that use the 2.4 GHz frequency band,
suffer from the interference limitations that need to be addressed. In this
paper we present an alternative approach to communication in BMS that relies on
the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology for battery sensor
readouts. Due to a vital concern over the counterfeited battery pack products,
security measures are also considered. To this end, we propose the use of an
effective, and easy to integrate, authentication schema that is supported by
the dedicated NFC devices. To test the usability of our design, a demonstrator
using the targeted devices was implemented and evaluated.

<p class="mathjax">Invertible neural networks (INNs) represent an important class of deep neural
network architectures that have been widely used in several applications. The
universal approximation properties of INNs have also been established recently.
However, the approximation rate of INNs is largely missing. In this work, we
provide an analysis of the capacity of a class of coupling-based INNs to
approximate bi-Lipschitz continuous mappings on a compact domain, and the
result shows that it can well approximate both forward and inverse maps
simultaneously. Furthermore, we develop an approach for approximating
bi-Lipschitz maps on infinite-dimensional spaces that simultaneously
approximate the forward and inverse maps, by combining model reduction with
principal component analysis and INNs for approximating the reduced map, and we
analyze the overall approximation error of the approach. Preliminary numerical
results show the feasibility of the approach for approximating the solution
operator for parameterized second-order elliptic problems.

<p class="mathjax">The Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities aims to digitize its Medieval
Latin Dictionary. This dictionary entails record cards referring to lemmas in
medieval Latin, a low-resource language. A crucial step of the digitization
process is the Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) of the handwritten lemmas
found on these record cards. In our work, we introduce an end-to-end pipeline,
tailored to the medieval Latin dictionary, for locating, extracting, and
transcribing the lemmas. We employ two state-of-the-art (SOTA) image
segmentation models to prepare the initial data set for the HTR task.
Furthermore, we experiment with different transformer-based models and conduct
a set of experiments to explore the capabilities of different combinations of
vision encoders with a GPT-2 decoder. Additionally, we also apply extensive
data augmentation resulting in a highly competitive model. The best-performing
setup achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.015, which is even superior to
the commercial Google Cloud Vision model, and shows more stable performance.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the research community has shown a lot of interest to
panoramic images that offer a 360-degree directional perspective. Multiple data
modalities can be fed, and complimentary characteristics can be utilized for
more robust and rich scene interpretation based on semantic segmentation, to
fully realize the potential. Existing research, however, mostly concentrated on
pinhole RGB-X semantic segmentation. In this study, we propose a
transformer-based cross-modal fusion architecture to bridge the gap between
multi-modal fusion and omnidirectional scene perception. We employ
distortion-aware modules to address extreme object deformations and panorama
distortions that result from equirectangular representation. Additionally, we
conduct cross-modal interactions for feature rectification and information
exchange before merging the features in order to communicate long-range
contexts for bi-modal and tri-modal feature streams. In thorough tests using
combinations of four different modality types in three indoor panoramic-view
datasets, our technique achieved state-of-the-art mIoU performance: 60.60% on
Stanford2D3DS (RGB-HHA), 71.97% Structured3D (RGB-D-N), and 35.92% Matterport3D
(RGB-D). We plan to release all codes and trained models soon.

<p class="mathjax">Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is an important technology in music and has
been researched for a long time. Previous approaches for OMR are usually based
on CNN for image understanding and RNN for music symbol classification. In this
paper, we propose a transformer-based approach with excellent global perceptual
capability for end-to-end polyphonic OMR, called TrOMR. We also introduce a
novel consistency loss function and a reasonable approach for data annotation
to improve recognition accuracy for complex music scores. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TrOMR outperforms current OMR methods, especially in
real-world scenarios. We also develop a TrOMR system and build a camera scene
dataset for full-page music scores in real-world. The code and datasets will be
made available for reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">The growing popularity of Vision Transformers as the go-to models for image
classification has led to an explosion of architectural modifications claiming
to be more efficient than the original ViT. However, a wide diversity of
experimental conditions prevents a fair comparison between all of them, based
solely on their reported results. To address this gap in comparability, we
conduct a comprehensive analysis of more than 30 models to evaluate the
efficiency of vision transformers and related architectures, considering
various performance metrics. Our benchmark provides a comparable baseline
across the landscape of efficiency-oriented transformers, unveiling a plethora
of surprising insights. For example, we discover that ViT is still Pareto
optimal across multiple efficiency metrics, despite the existence of several
alternative approaches claiming to be more efficient. Results also indicate
that hybrid attention-CNN models fare particularly well when it comes to low
inference memory and number of parameters, and also that it is better to scale
the model size, than the image size. Furthermore, we uncover a strong positive
correlation between the number of FLOPS and the training memory, which enables
the estimation of required VRAM from theoretical measurements alone.
<br />Thanks to our holistic evaluation, this study offers valuable insights for
practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting
models for specific applications. We publicly release our code and data at

<p class="mathjax">As the dawn of sixth-generation (6G) networking approaches, it promises
unprecedented advancements in communication and automation. Among the leading
innovations of 6G is the concept of Zero Touch Networks (ZTNs), aiming to
achieve fully automated, self-optimizing networks with minimal human
intervention. Despite the advantages ZTNs offer in terms of efficiency and
scalability, challenges surrounding transparency, adaptability, and human trust
remain prevalent. Concurrently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents an opportunity to elevate the ZTN framework by bridging the gap
between automated processes and human-centric interfaces. This paper explores
the integration of LLMs into ZTNs, highlighting their potential to enhance
network transparency and improve user interactions. Through a comprehensive
case study on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based anti-jamming technique,
we demonstrate how LLMs can distill intricate network operations into
intuitive, human-readable reports. Additionally, we address the technical and
ethical intricacies of melding LLMs with ZTNs, with an emphasis on data
privacy, transparency, and bias reduction. Looking ahead, we identify emerging
research avenues at the nexus of LLMs and ZTNs, advocating for sustained
innovation and interdisciplinary synergy in the domain of automated networks.

<p class="mathjax">Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for diagnosing knee
osteoarthritis (OA) have faced criticism for their lack of transparency and
interpretability, despite achieving medical-expert-like performance. This
opacity makes them challenging to trust in clinical practice. Recently,
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a specialized
technique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by revealing
how the prediction is derived, thus promoting the use of AI systems in
healthcare. This paper presents the first survey of XAI techniques used for
knee OA diagnosis. The XAI techniques are discussed from two perspectives: data
interpretability and model interpretability. The aim of this paper is to
provide valuable insights into XAI's potential towards a more reliable knee OA
diagnosis approach and encourage its adoption in clinical practice.

<p class="mathjax">Attribution methods shed light on the explainability of data-driven
approaches such as deep learning models by revealing the most contributing
features to decisions that have been made. A widely accepted way of deriving
feature attributions is to analyze the gradients of the target function with
respect to input features. Analysis of gradients requires full access to the
target system, meaning that solutions of this kind treat the target system as a
white-box. However, the white-box assumption may be untenable due to security
and safety concerns, thus limiting their practical applications. As an answer
to the limited flexibility, this paper presents GEEX (gradient-estimation-based
explanation), an explanation method that delivers gradient-like explanations
under a black-box setting. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed method with a
path method. The resulting approach iGEEX (integrated GEEX) satisfies the four
fundamental axioms of attribution methods: sensitivity, insensitivity,
implementation invariance, and linearity. With a focus on image data, the
exhaustive experiments empirically show that the proposed methods outperform
state-of-the-art black-box methods and achieve competitive performance compared
to the ones with full access.

<p class="mathjax">Recognizing objects from sparse and noisy events becomes extremely difficult
when paired images and category labels do not exist. In this paper, we study
label-free event-based object recognition where category labels and paired
images are not available. To this end, we propose a joint formulation of object
recognition and image reconstruction in a complementary manner. Our method
first reconstructs images from events and performs object recognition through
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling better recognition
through a rich context of images. Since the category information is essential
in reconstructing images, we propose category-guided attraction loss and
category-agnostic repulsion loss to bridge the textual features of predicted
categories and the visual features of reconstructed images using CLIP.
Moreover, we introduce a reliable data sampling strategy and local-global
reconstruction consistency to boost joint learning of two tasks. To enhance the
accuracy of prediction and quality of reconstruction, we also propose a
prototype-based approach using unpaired images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method and its extensibility for zero-shot
object recognition. Our project code is available at

<p class="mathjax">In today's modern communications, with evolution of various applications, the
demand of data rate is increasing exponentially at the cost of huge consumption
of available resources. It has been recorded that the communication networks
dissipate nearly 1\% of the world-wide total power consumption, results in
millions of tons of CO2 emission due to their production and thereby causes
various environmental health hazards. The optimal utilization of available
resources that can balance the present coexisting problem without any
compromise on the high throughput demand, paves the way for the next generation
green 5G wireless networks. In this chapter, we study the minimization of total
power consumption while satisfying the desired coverage of the user equipments
(UEs) to provide the minimum throughput over the network. In this regard, the
deployment of base stations (BSs), their number, and transmit power are
optimized in two scenarios (i) when the UEs are large in 5G wireless network
and (ii) when moderate UEs are distributed over the field.

<p class="mathjax">Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is popular in the computer vision
community recently, registering multiple NeRFs has yet to gain much attention.
Unlike the existing work, NeRF2NeRF, which is based on traditional optimization
methods and needs human annotated keypoints, we propose DReg-NeRF to solve the
NeRF registration problem on object-centric scenes without human intervention.
After training NeRF models, our DReg-NeRF first extracts features from the
occupancy grid in NeRF. Subsequently, our DReg-NeRF utilizes a transformer
architecture with self-attention and cross-attention layers to learn the
relations between pairwise NeRF blocks. In contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point cloud registration methods, the decoupled correspondences are supervised
by surface fields without any ground truth overlapping labels. We construct a
novel view synthesis dataset with 1,700+ 3D objects obtained from Objaverse to
train our network. When evaluated on the test set, our proposed method beats
the SOTA point cloud registration methods by a large margin, with a mean
$\text{RPE}=9.67^{\circ}$ and a mean $\text{RTE}=0.038$.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic agents performing domestic chores by natural language directives are
required to master the complex job of navigating environment and interacting
with objects in the environments. The tasks given to the agents are often
composite thus are challenging as completing them require to reason about
multiple subtasks, e.g., bring a cup of coffee. To address the challenge, we
propose to divide and conquer it by breaking the task into multiple subgoals
and attend to them individually for better navigation and interaction. We call
it Multi-level Compositional Reasoning Agent (MCR-Agent). Specifically, we
learn a three-level action policy. At the highest level, we infer a sequence of
human-interpretable subgoals to be executed based on language instructions by a
high-level policy composition controller. At the middle level, we
discriminatively control the agent's navigation by a master policy by
alternating between a navigation policy and various independent interaction
policies. Finally, at the lowest level, we infer manipulation actions with the
corresponding object masks using the appropriate interaction policy. Our
approach not only generates human interpretable subgoals but also achieves
2.03% absolute gain to comparable state of the arts in the efficiency metric
(PLWSR in unseen set) without using rule-based planning or a semantic spatial
memory.

<p class="mathjax">Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the
low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of
images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model
has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby
raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image
restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate
diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior
performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and
enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce.
In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent
diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning
paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and
evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion
model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion
models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the
innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR,
intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods
thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and
evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for
open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution,
deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing
works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future
research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model
compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant
learning, and framework design.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an elegant optimization framework consisting of a mix of
linear-matrix-inequality and second-order-cone constraints. The proposed
framework generalizes the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) enabled solution to the
typical transmit beamforming problems presented in the form of quadratically
constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) in the literature. It is proved that the
optimization problems subsumed under the framework always admit a rank-one
optimal solution when they are feasible and their optimal solutions are not
trivial. This finding indicates that the relaxation is tight as the optimal
solution of the original beamforming QCQP can be straightforwardly obtained
from that of the SDR counterpart without any loss of optimality. Four
representative examples of transmit beamforming, i.e., transmit beamforming
with perfect channel state information (CSI), transmit beamforming with
imperfect CSI, chance-constraint approach for imperfect CSI, and
reconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS) aided beamforming, are shown to
demonstrate how the proposed optimization framework can be realized in deriving
the SDR counterparts for different beamforming designs.

<p class="mathjax">Domain generalization (DG) is proposed to deal with the issue of domain
shift, which occurs when statistical differences exist between source and
target domains. However, most current methods do not account for a common
realistic scenario where the source and target domains have different classes.
To overcome this deficiency, open set domain generalization (OSDG) then emerges
as a more practical setting to recognize unseen classes in unseen domains. An
intuitive approach is to use multiple one-vs-all classifiers to define decision
boundaries for each class and reject the outliers as unknown. However, the
significant class imbalance between positive and negative samples often causes
the boundaries biased towards positive ones, resulting in misclassification for
known samples in the unseen target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based framework called dualistic MEta-learning with joint
DomaIn-Class matching (MEDIC), which considers gradient matching towards
inter-domain and inter-class splits simultaneously to find a generalizable
boundary balanced for all tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDIC
not only outperforms previous methods in open set scenarios, but also maintains
competitive close set generalization ability at the same time. Our code is
available at https://github.com/zzwdx/MEDIC.

<p class="mathjax">Recent times have witnessed the rise of anti-phishing schemes powered by deep
learning (DL). In particular, logo-based phishing detectors rely on DL models
from Computer Vision to identify logos of well-known brands on webpages, to
detect malicious webpages that imitate a given brand. For instance, Siamese
networks have demonstrated notable performance for these tasks, enabling the
corresponding anti-phishing solutions to detect even "zero-day" phishing
webpages. In this work, we take the next step of studying the robustness of
logo-based phishing detectors against adversarial ML attacks. We propose a
novel attack exploiting generative adversarial perturbations to craft
"adversarial logos" that evade phishing detectors. We evaluate our attacks
through: (i) experiments on datasets containing real logos, to evaluate the
robustness of state-of-the-art phishing detectors; and (ii) user studies to
gauge whether our adversarial logos can deceive human eyes. The results show
that our proposed attack is capable of crafting perturbed logos subtle enough
to evade various DL models-achieving an evasion rate of up to 95%. Moreover,
users are not able to spot significant differences between generated
adversarial logos and original ones.

<p class="mathjax">Increasing the size of embedding layers has shown to be effective in
improving the performance of recommendation models, yet gradually causing their
sizes to exceed terabytes in industrial recommender systems, and hence the
increase of computing and storage costs. To save resources while maintaining
model performances, we propose SHARK, the model compression practice we have
summarized in the recommender system of industrial scenarios. SHARK consists of
two main components. First, we use the novel first-order component of Taylor
expansion as importance scores to prune the number of embedding tables (feature
fields). Second, we introduce a new row-wise quantization method to apply
different quantization strategies to each embedding. We conduct extensive
experiments on both public and industrial datasets, demonstrating that each
component of our proposed SHARK framework outperforms previous approaches. We
conduct A/B tests in multiple models on Kuaishou, such as short video,
e-commerce, and advertising recommendation models. The results of the online
A/B test showed SHARK can effectively reduce the memory footprint of the
embedded layer. For the short-video scenarios, the compressed model without any
performance drop significantly saves 70% storage and thousands of machines,
improves 30\% queries per second (QPS), and has been deployed to serve hundreds
of millions of users and process tens of billions of requests every day.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the fair allocation of indivisible items to several agents with
additional conflict constraints. These are represented by a conflict graph
where each item corresponds to a vertex of the graph and edges in the graph
represent incompatible pairs of items which should not be allocated to the same
agent. This setting combines the issues of Partition and Independent Set and
can be seen as a partial coloring of the conflict graph. In the resulting
optimization problem each agent has its own valuation function for the profits
of the items. We aim at maximizing the lowest total profit obtained by any of
the agents. In a previous paper this problem was shown to be strongly \NP-hard
for several well-known graph classes, e.g., bipartite graphs and their line
graphs. On the other hand, it was shown that pseudo-polynomial time algorithms
exist for the classes of chordal graphs, cocomparability graphs, biconvex
bipartite graphs, and graphs of bounded treewidth. In this contribution we
extend this line of research by developing pseudo-polynomial time algorithms
that solve the problem for the class of convex bipartite conflict graphs,
graphs of bounded clique-width, and graphs of bounded tree-independence number.
The algorithms are based on dynamic programming and also permit fully
polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS).

<p class="mathjax">Barrier terms for Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) energy are crucial for
maintaining an intersection and inversion free simulation trajectory. However,
existing formulations which directly use distance for measuring the state of
contact can restrict implementation design and performance. This is because
numerical eigendecompositions are required for guaranteeing positive
semi-definiteness of the Hessian of the barrier energy during optimization with
Projected-Newton solvers, and alternative Gauss-Newton methods suffer from
significantly reduced convergence rates. We rewrite the barrier function of IPC
to derive an efficient approximation its Hessian, which can then be used for
simultaneous construction and projection to positive semi-definite state. The
key idea is to formulate a simplicial geometric measure of contact using mesh
boundary elements, where analytic eigensystems are obtained for minimising the
proposed barrier energy with superlinear convergence to retain much of the
advantage of Newton-type methods. Our approach is suitable for standard second
order unconstrained optimization strategies for IPC based collision processing,
minimizing nonlinear nonconvex functions where the Hessian may be indefinite.
The result is a 3-times speedup over the standard full-space IPC barrier
formulation based on direct Euclidean distance measures. We further apply our
analytic proxy eigensystems to produce an entirely GPU-based implementation of
IPC with significant further acceleration.

<p class="mathjax">The robustness of legged locomotion is crucial for quadrupedal robots in
challenging terrains. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promising
results in legged locomotion and various methods try to integrate privileged
distillation, scene modeling, and external sensors to improve the
generalization and robustness of locomotion policies. However, these methods
are hard to handle uncertain scenarios such as abrupt terrain changes or
unexpected external forces. In this paper, we consider a novel risk-sensitive
perspective to enhance the robustness of legged locomotion. Specifically, we
employ a distributional value function learned by quantile regression to model
the aleatoric uncertainty of environments, and perform risk-averse policy
learning by optimizing the worst-case scenarios via a risk distortion measure.
Extensive experiments in both simulation environments and a real Aliengo robot
demonstrate that our method is efficient in handling various external
disturbances, and the resulting policy exhibits improved robustness in harsh
and uncertain situations in legged locomotion. Videos are available at

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based sequential recommendation (SR) has been booming in recent
years, with the self-attention mechanism as its key component. Self-attention
has been widely believed to be able to effectively select those informative and
relevant items from a sequence of interacted items for next-item prediction via
learning larger attention weights for these items. However, this may not always
be true in reality. Our empirical analysis of some representative
Transformer-based SR models reveals that it is not uncommon for large attention
weights to be assigned to less relevant items, which can result in inaccurate
recommendations. Through further in-depth analysis, we find two factors that
may contribute to such inaccurate assignment of attention weights: sub-optimal
position encoding and noisy input. To this end, in this paper, we aim to
address this significant yet challenging gap in existing works. To be specific,
we propose a simple yet effective framework called Attention Calibration for
Transformer-based Sequential Recommendation (AC-TSR). In AC-TSR, a novel
spatial calibrator and adversarial calibrator are designed respectively to
directly calibrates those incorrectly assigned attention weights. The former is
devised to explicitly capture the spatial relationships (i.e., order and
distance) among items for more precise calculation of attention weights. The
latter aims to redistribute the attention weights based on each item's
contribution to the next-item prediction. AC-TSR is readily adaptable and can
be seamlessly integrated into various existing transformer-based SR models.
Extensive experimental results on four benchmark real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ACTSR via significant
recommendation performance enhancements. The source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">In the field of monocular 3D detection, it is common practice to utilize
scene geometric clues to enhance the detector's performance. However, many
existing works adopt these clues explicitly such as estimating a depth map and
back-projecting it into 3D space. This explicit methodology induces sparsity in
3D representations due to the increased dimensionality from 2D to 3D, and leads
to substantial information loss, especially for distant and occluded objects.
To alleviate this issue, we propose MonoNeRD, a novel detection framework that
can infer dense 3D geometry and occupancy. Specifically, we model scenes with
Signed Distance Functions (SDF), facilitating the production of dense 3D
representations. We treat these representations as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and then employ volume rendering to recover RGB images and depth maps.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce volume
rendering for M3D, and demonstrates the potential of implicit reconstruction
for image-based 3D perception. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI-3D
benchmark and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MonoNeRD.

<p class="mathjax">Mid-air haptic interfaces employ focused ultrasound waves to generate
touchless haptic sensations on the skin. Prior studies have demonstrated the
potential positive impact of mid-air haptic feedback on virtual experiences,
enhancing aspects such as enjoyment, immersion, and sense of agency. As a
highly immersive environment, Virtual Reality (VR) is being explored as a tool
for stress management and relaxation in current research. However, the impact
of incorporating mid-air haptic stimuli into relaxing experiences in VR has not
been studied thus far. In this paper, for the first time, we design a mid-air
haptic stimulation that is congruent with a relaxing scene in VR, and conduct a
user study investigating the effectiveness of this experience. Our user study
encompasses three different conditions: a control group with no relaxation
intervention, a VR-only relaxation experience, and a VR+Haptics relaxation
experience that includes the mid-air haptic feedback. While we did not find any
significant differences between the conditions, a trend suggesting that the
VR+Haptics condition might be associated with greater pleasure emerged,
requiring further validation with a larger sample size. These initial findings
set the foundation for future investigations into leveraging multimodal
interventions in VR, utilising mid-air haptics to potentially enhance
relaxation experiences.

<p class="mathjax">Inverse problems in image reconstruction are fundamentally complicated by
unknown noise properties. Classical iterative deconvolution approaches amplify
noise and require careful parameter selection for an optimal trade-off between
sharpness and grain. Deep learning methods allow for flexible parametrization
of the noise and learning its properties directly from the data. Recently,
self-supervised blind-spot neural networks were successfully adopted for image
deconvolution by including a known point-spread function in the end-to-end
training. However, their practical application has been limited to 2D images in
the biomedical domain because it implies large kernels that are poorly
optimized. We tackle this problem with Fast Fourier Transform convolutions that
provide training speed-up in 3D microscopy deconvolution tasks. Further, we
propose to adopt a Siamese invariance loss for deconvolution and empirically
identify its optimal position in the neural network between blind-spot and full
image branches. The experimental results show that our improved framework
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art deconvolution methods with a known
point spread function.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) performed in an asynchronous manner plays a
crucial role in training large-scale machine learning models. However, the
generalization performance of asynchronous delayed SGD, which is an essential
metric for assessing machine learning algorithms, has rarely been explored.
Existing generalization error bounds are rather pessimistic and cannot reveal
the correlation between asynchronous delays and generalization. In this paper,
we investigate sharper generalization error bound for SGD with asynchronous
delay $\tau$. Leveraging the generating function analysis tool, we first
establish the average stability of the delayed gradient algorithm. Based on
this algorithmic stability, we provide upper bounds on the generalization error
of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{T-\tau}{n\tau})$ and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{1}{n})$ for quadratic convex and strongly convex
problems, respectively, where $T$ refers to the iteration number and $n$ is the
amount of training data. Our theoretical results indicate that asynchronous
delays reduce the generalization error of the delayed SGD algorithm. Analogous
analysis can be generalized to the random delay setting, and the experimental
results validate our theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">Modern large language models demonstrate impressive capabilities in text
generation and generalization. However, they often struggle with solving text
editing tasks, particularly when it comes to correcting spelling errors and
mistypings. In this paper, we present a methodology for generative spelling
correction (SC), which was tested on English and Russian languages and
potentially can be extended to any language with minor changes. Our research
mainly focuses on exploring natural spelling errors and mistypings in texts and
studying the ways those errors can be emulated in correct sentences to
effectively enrich generative models' pre-train procedure. We investigate the
impact of such emulations and the models' abilities across different text
domains. In this work, we investigate two spelling corruption techniques: 1)
first one mimics human behavior when making a mistake through leveraging
statistics of errors from particular dataset and 2) second adds the most common
spelling errors, keyboard miss clicks, and some heuristics within the texts. We
conducted experiments employing various corruption strategies, models'
architectures and sizes on the pre-training and fine-tuning stages and
evaluated the models using single-domain and multi-domain test sets. As a
practical outcome of our work, we introduce SAGE (Spell checking via
Augmentation and Generative distribution Emulation) is a library for automatic
generative SC that includes a family of pre-trained generative models and
built-in augmentation algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Many medical or pharmaceutical processes have strict guidelines regarding
continuous hygiene monitoring. This often involves the labor-intensive task of
manually counting microorganisms in Petri dishes by trained personnel.
Automation attempts often struggle due to major challenges: significant scaling
differences, low separation, low contrast, etc. To address these challenges, we
introduce AttnPAFPN, a high-resolution detection pipeline that leverages a
novel transformer variation, the efficient-global self-attention mechanism. Our
streamlined approach can be easily integrated in almost any multi-scale object
detection pipeline. In a comprehensive evaluation on the publicly available
AGAR dataset, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of our network over the
current state-of-the-art. In order to demonstrate the task-independent
performance of our approach, we perform further experiments on COCO and
LIVECell datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks are prone to learning spurious correlations embedded in
the training data, leading to potentially biased predictions. This poses risks
when deploying these models for high-stake decision-making, such as in medical
applications. Current methods for post-hoc model correction either require
input-level annotations, which are only possible for spatially localized
biases, or augment the latent feature space, thereby hoping to enforce the
right reasons. We present a novel method ensuring the right reasons on the
concept level by reducing the model's sensitivity towards biases through the
gradient. When modeling biases via Concept Activation Vectors, we highlight the
importance of choosing robust directions, as traditional regression-based
approaches such as Support Vector Machines tend to result in diverging
directions. We effectively mitigate biases in controlled and real-world
settings on the ISIC, Bone Age, ImageNet and CelebA datasets using VGG, ResNet
and EfficientNet architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Software startups are newly created companies with no operating history and
oriented towards producing cutting-edge products. However, despite the
increasing importance of startups in the economy, few scientific studies
attempt to address software engineering issues, especially for early-stage
startups. If anything, startups need engineering practices of the same level or
better than those of larger companies, as their time and resources are more
scarce, and one failed project can put them out of business. In this study we
aim to improve understanding of the software development strategies employed by
startups. We performed this state-of-practice investigation using a grounded
theory approach. We packaged the results in the Greenfield Startup Model (GSM),
which explains the priority of startups to release the product as quickly as
possible. This strategy allows startups to verify product and market fit, and
to adjust the product trajectory according to early collected user feedback.
The need to shorten time-to-market, by speeding up the development through
low-precision engineering activities, is counterbalanced by the need to
restructure the product before targeting further growth. The resulting
implications of the GSM outline challenges and gaps, pointing out opportunities
for future research to develop and validate engineering practices in the
startup context.

<p class="mathjax">With easier access to powerful compute resources, there is a growing trend in
the field of AI for software development to develop larger and larger language
models (LLMs) to address a variety of programming tasks. Even LLMs applied to
tasks from the high-performance computing (HPC) domain are huge in size (e.g.,
billions of parameters) and demand expensive compute resources for training. We
found this design choice confusing - why do we need large LLMs trained on
natural languages and programming languages unrelated to HPC for HPC-specific
tasks? In this line of work, we aim to question design choices made by existing
LLMs by developing smaller LLMs for specific domains - we call them
domain-specific LLMs. Specifically, we start off with HPC as a domain and
propose a novel tokenizer named Tokompiler, designed specifically for
preprocessing code in HPC and compilation-centric tasks. Tokompiler leverages
knowledge of language primitives to generate language-oriented tokens,
providing a context-aware understanding of code structure while avoiding human
semantics attributed to code structures completely. We applied Tokompiler to
pre-train two state-of-the-art models, SPT-Code and Polycoder, for a Fortran
code corpus mined from GitHub. We evaluate the performance of these models
against the conventional LLMs. Results demonstrate that Tokompiler
significantly enhances code completion accuracy and semantic understanding
compared to traditional tokenizers in normalized-perplexity tests, down to ~1
perplexity score. This research opens avenues for further advancements in
domain-specific LLMs, catering to the unique demands of HPC and compilation
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models (FMs) have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide
range of downstream tasks in various domains. Nevertheless, general-purpose FMs
often face challenges when confronted with domain-specific problems, due to
their limited access to the proprietary training data in a particular domain.
In life science, a large portion of biomedical knowledge is encapsulated within
heterogeneous biological data, such as molecular structures, wet-lab experiment
results, and knowledge bases, which exhibit significant modality gaps with
human natural language. In this paper, we introduce BioMedGPT, an open
multimodal generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) for biomedicine, to bridge
the gap between biomedical data and natural language. BioMedGPT allows users to
easily "communicate" with various biological modalities through free text,
which is the first of its kind. BioMedGPT aligns different biological
modalities with the text modality via a large generative language model,
namely, BioMedGPT-LM. We publish BioMedGPT-10B, which unifies the feature
spaces of molecules, proteins, and natural language via encoding and alignment.
Through fine-tuning, BioMedGPT-10B outperforms or is on par with human and
significantly larger general-purpose foundation models on the biomedical QA
task. It also demonstrates promising performance in the molecule QA and protein
QA tasks, which could greatly accelerate the discovery of new drugs and
therapeutic targets. In addition, BioMedGPT-LM-7B is the first large generative
language model based on Llama2 in the biomedical domain, therefore is
commercial friendly. Both BioMedGPT-10B and BioMedGPT-LM-7B are open-sourced to
the research community. We also publish the datasets that are meticulously
curated for the alignment of multi-modalities, i.e., PubChemQA and UniProtQA.
All the models, codes, and datasets are publicly available.

graphs in which Player $0$ announces a strategy and Player $1$, having several
objectives, responds rationally by following plays providing him Pareto-optimal
payoffs given the strategy of Player $0$. The Stackelberg-Pareto synthesis
problem, asking whether Player $0$ can announce a strategy which satisfies his

<p class="mathjax">Detailed timing models are indispensable tools for the design space
exploration of Multiprocessor Systems on Chip (MPSoCs). As core counts continue
to increase, the complexity in memory hierarchies and interconnect topologies
is also growing, making accurate predictions of design decisions more
challenging than ever. In this context, the open-source Full System Simulator
(FSS) gem5 is a popular choice for MPSoC design space exploration, thanks to
its flexibility and robust set of detailed timing models. However, its
single-threaded simulation kernel severely hampers its throughput. To address
this challenge, we introduce parti-gem5, an extension of gem5 that enables
parallel timing simulations on modern multi-core simulation hosts. Unlike
previous works, parti-gem5 supports gem5's timing mode, the O3CPU, and Ruby's
custom cache and interconnect models. Compared to reference single-thread
simulations, we achieved speedups of up to 42.7x when simulating a 120-core ARM
MPSoC on a 64-core x86-64 host system. While our method introduces timing
deviations, the error in total simulated time is below 15% in most cases.

<p class="mathjax">As a privacy-preserving method for implementing Vertical Federated Learning,
Split Learning has been extensively researched. However, numerous studies have
indicated that the privacy-preserving capability of Split Learning is
insufficient. In this paper, we primarily focus on label inference attacks in
Split Learning under regression setting, which are mainly implemented through
the gradient inversion method. To defend against label inference attacks, we
propose Random Label Extension (RLE), where labels are extended to obfuscate
the label information contained in the gradients, thereby preventing the
attacker from utilizing gradients to train an attack model that can infer the
original labels. To further minimize the impact on the original task, we
propose Model-based adaptive Label Extension (MLE), where original labels are
preserved in the extended labels and dominate the training process. The
experimental results show that compared to the basic defense methods, our
proposed defense methods can significantly reduce the attack model's
performance while preserving the original task's performance.

<p class="mathjax">Research in natural language processing has demonstrated that the quality of
generations from trained autoregressive language models is significantly
influenced by the used sampling strategy. In this study, we investigate the
impact of different sampling techniques on musical qualities such as diversity
and structure. To accomplish this, we train a high-capacity transformer model
on a vast collection of highly-structured Irish folk melodies and analyze the
musical qualities of the samples generated using distribution truncation
sampling techniques. Specifically, we use nucleus sampling, the recently
proposed "typical sampling", and conventional ancestral sampling. We evaluate
the effect of these sampling strategies in two scenarios: optimal circumstances
with a well-calibrated model and suboptimal circumstances where we
systematically degrade the model's performance. We assess the generated samples
using objective and subjective evaluations. We discover that probability
truncation techniques may restrict diversity and structural patterns in optimal
circumstances, but may also produce more musical samples in suboptimal
circumstances.

<p class="mathjax">With the success of self-supervised learning, multimodal foundation models
have rapidly adapted a wide range of downstream tasks driven by vision and
language (VL) pretraining. State-of-the-art methods achieve impressive
performance by pre-training on large-scale datasets. However, bridging the
semantic gap between the two modalities remains a nonnegligible challenge for
VL tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient computation framework for
multimodal alignment by introducing a novel visual semantic module to further
improve the performance of the VL tasks. Specifically, we propose a flexible
model, namely Artificial-Spiking Hierarchical Networks (ASH-Nets), which
combines the complementary advantages of Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enrich visual semantic representations. In
particular, a visual concrete encoder and a semantic abstract encoder are
constructed to learn continuous and discrete latent variables to enhance the
flexibility of semantic encoding. Considering the spatio-temporal properties of
SNNs modeling, we introduce a contrastive learning method to optimize the
inputs of similar samples. This can improve the computational efficiency of the
hierarchical network, while the augmentation of hard samples is beneficial to
the learning of visual representations. Furthermore, the Spiking to Text
Uni-Alignment Learning (STUA) pre-training method is proposed, which only
relies on text features to enhance the encoding ability of abstract semantics.
We validate the performance on multiple well-established downstream VL tasks.
Experiments show that the proposed ASH-Nets achieve competitive results.

<p class="mathjax">Overtaking on two-lane roads is a great challenge for autonomous vehicles, as
oncoming traffic appearing on the opposite lane may require the vehicle to
change its decision and abort the overtaking. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
has shown promise for difficult decision problems such as this, but it requires
massive number of data, especially if the action space is continuous. This
paper proposes to incorporate guidance from an expert system into DRL to
increase its sample efficiency in the autonomous overtaking setting. The
guidance system developed in this study is composed of constrained iterative
LQR and PID controllers. The novelty lies in the incorporation of a fading
guidance function, which gradually decreases the effect of the expert system,
allowing the agent to initially learn an appropriate action swiftly and then
improve beyond the performance of the expert system. This approach thus
combines the strengths of traditional control engineering with the flexibility
of learning systems, expanding the capabilities of the autonomous system. The
proposed methodology for autonomous vehicle overtaking does not depend on a
particular DRL algorithm and three state-of-the-art algorithms are used as
baselines for evaluation. Simulation results show that incorporating expert
system guidance improves state-of-the-art DRL algorithms greatly in both sample
efficiency and driving safety.

<p class="mathjax">This dissertation explores the impact of bias in deep neural networks and
presents methods for reducing its influence on model performance. The first
part begins by categorizing and describing potential sources of bias and errors
in data and models, with a particular focus on bias in machine learning
pipelines. The next chapter outlines a taxonomy and methods of Explainable AI
as a way to justify predictions and control and improve the model. Then, as an
example of a laborious manual data inspection and bias discovery process, a
skin lesion dataset is manually examined. A Global Explanation for the Bias
Identification method is proposed as an alternative semi-automatic approach to
manual data exploration for discovering potential biases in data. Relevant
numerical methods and metrics are discussed for assessing the effects of the
identified biases on the model. Whereas identifying errors and bias is
critical, improving the model and reducing the number of flaws in the future is
an absolute priority. Hence, the second part of the thesis focuses on
mitigating the influence of bias on ML models. Three approaches are proposed
and discussed: Style Transfer Data Augmentation, Targeted Data Augmentations,
and Attribution Feedback. Style Transfer Data Augmentation aims to address
shape and texture bias by merging a style of a malignant lesion with a
conflicting shape of a benign one. Targeted Data Augmentations randomly insert
possible biases into all images in the dataset during the training, as a way to
make the process random and, thus, destroy spurious correlations. Lastly,
Attribution Feedback is used to fine-tune the model to improve its accuracy by
eliminating obvious mistakes and teaching it to ignore insignificant input
parts via an attribution loss. The goal of these approaches is to reduce the
influence of bias on machine learning models, rather than eliminate it
entirely.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the transformative
potential of additive manufacturing (AM) since it allows for producing highly
customizable and complex components while reducing lead times and costs. The
rise of AM for traditional and new business models enforces the need for
efficient planning procedures for AM facilities. In this area, the assignment
and sequencing of components to be built by an AM machine, also called a 3D
printer, is a complex problem joining the nesting and scheduling of parts to be
printed. This paper proposes a new branch-and-cut algorithm for integrated
planning for unrelated parallel machines. The algorithm is based on
combinatorial Benders decomposition: The scheduling problem is considered in
the master problem, while the feasibility of a solution is checked in the
sub-problem. Current state-of-the-art techniques are extended to solve the
orthogonal packing with rotation to speed up the solution of the sub-problem.
Extensive computational tests on existing instances and a new benchmark
instance set show the algorithm's superior performance compared to an existing
integrated mixed-integer programming model.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have seen a growing interest in Scene Graph Generation (SGG), a
comprehensive visual scene understanding task that aims to predict entity
relationships using a relation encoder-decoder pipeline stacked on top of an
object encoder-decoder backbone. Unfortunately, current SGG methods suffer from
an information loss regarding the entities local-level cues during the relation
encoding process. To mitigate this, we introduce the Vision rElation
TransfOrmer (VETO), consisting of a novel local-level entity relation encoder.
We further observe that many existing SGG methods claim to be unbiased, but are
still biased towards either head or tail classes. To overcome this bias, we
introduce a Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET) learning strategy that captures
important relation features without bias towards head or tail classes.
Experimental results on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that VETO + MEET
boosts the predictive performance by up to 47 percentage over the state of the
art while being 10 times smaller.

<p class="mathjax">The discovery of scientific formulae that parsimoniously explain natural
phenomena and align with existing background theory is a key goal in science.
Historically, scientists have derived natural laws by manipulating equations
based on existing knowledge, forming new equations, and verifying them
experimentally. In recent years, data-driven scientific discovery has emerged
as a viable competitor in settings with large amounts of experimental data.
Unfortunately, data-driven methods often fail to discover valid laws when data
is noisy or scarce. Accordingly, recent works combine regression and reasoning
to eliminate formulae inconsistent with background theory. However, the problem
of searching over the space of formulae consistent with background theory to
find one that fits the data best is not well solved. We propose a solution to
this problem when all axioms and scientific laws are expressible via polynomial
equalities and inequalities and argue that our approach is widely applicable.
We further model notions of minimal complexity using binary variables and
logical constraints, solve polynomial optimization problems via mixed-integer
linear or semidefinite optimization, and automatically prove the validity of
our scientific discoveries via Positivestellensatz certificates. Remarkably,
the optimization techniques leveraged in this paper allow our approach to run
in polynomial time with fully correct background theory, or non-deterministic
polynomial (NP) time with partially correct background theory. We
experimentally demonstrate that some famous scientific laws, including Kepler's
Third Law of Planetary Motion, the Hagen-Poiseuille Equation, and the Radiated
Gravitational Wave Power equation, can be automatically derived from sets of
partially correct background axioms.

<p class="mathjax">Robot-assisted surgery has made significant progress, with instrument
segmentation being a critical factor in surgical intervention quality. It
serves as the building block to facilitate surgical robot navigation and
surgical education for the next generation of operating intelligence. Although
existing methods have achieved accurate instrument segmentation results, they
simultaneously generate segmentation masks for all instruments, without the
capability to specify a target object and allow an interactive experience. This
work explores a new task of Referring Surgical Video Instrument Segmentation
(RSVIS), which aims to automatically identify and segment the corresponding
surgical instruments based on the given language expression. To achieve this,
we devise a novel Video-Instrument Synergistic Network (VIS-Net) to learn both
video-level and instrument-level knowledge to boost performance, while previous
work only used video-level information. Meanwhile, we design a Graph-based
Relation-aware Module (GRM) to model the correlation between multi-modal
information (i.e., textual description and video frame) to facilitate the
extraction of instrument-level information. We are also the first to produce
two RSVIS datasets to promote related research. Our method is verified on these
datasets, and experimental results exhibit that the VIS-Net can significantly
outperform existing state-of-the-art referring segmentation methods. Our code
and our datasets will be released upon the publication of this work.

meeting point for researchers and practitioners from the two separate fields of
Requirements Engineering (RE) and Testing. The goal is to improve the
connection and alignment of these two areas through an exchange of ideas,
challenges, practices, experiences and results. The long term aim is to build a
community and a body of knowledge within the intersection of RE and Testing,
i.e. RET. The 3rd workshop was held in co-location with REFSQ 2016 in
Gothenburg, Sweden. The workshop continued in the same interactive vein as the
predecessors and included a keynote, paper presentations with ample time for
discussions, and panels. In order to create an RET knowledge base, this
crosscutting area elicits contributions from both RE and Testing, and from both
researchers and practitioners. A range of papers were presented from short
positions papers to full research papers that cover connections between the two
fields.

<p class="mathjax">In conceptual modeling (CM) as a subdiscipline of software engineering,
current proposed ontologies (categorical analysis of entities) are typically
established through whole adoption of philosophical theories (e.g. Bunge s). In
this paper, we pursue an interdisciplinary research approach to develop a
diagrammatic-based ontological foundation for CM using philosophical ontology
as a secondary source. It is an endeavor to escape an offshore procurement of
ontology from philosophy and implant it in CM. In such an effort, the CM
diagrammatic language plays an important role in contrast to dogmatic
philosophical languages obsession with abstract entities. Specifically, this
paper is about developing a descriptive (in contrast to formal) ontology that a
modeler accepts as a supplementary account of reality when using thinging
machines (TMs; i.e. a reality that uncovers the ontology of things that TM
modeling discusses or talks about, akin to the ontology of natural language).
The aim here is aligned toward developing CM notions and processes that are
firm enough. Classical analysis of being per se (e.g. identity, substance) is
de-emphasized in this work; nevertheless, philosophical concepts form an
acknowledged authority to compare to. As a case study, such a methodology is
applied to the notion of information. This application would enhance
understanding of the TM methodology and clarify some of the issues that shed
light on the question of the nature of information as an important concept in
software engineering. Information is defined as about events; that is, it is
about existing things. It is viewed as having a subsisting nature that exists
only through being carried on by other things. The results seem to indicate a
promising approach to define information and understand its nature.

<p class="mathjax">Recent statistics have demonstrated that missing items have become the main
cause of loss for retailers in inventory management. To quickly identify
missing tags, traditional protocols adopt Aloha-based strategies which take a
long time, especially when the number of tags is large. Among them, few works
considered the effect of unexpected unknown tags on the missing tag
identification process. With the presence of unknown tags, some missing tags
may be falsely identified as present. Thus, the system's reliability is hardly
guaranteed. In this work, we propose an efficient early-breaking estimation and
tree-splitting-based missing tag identification (ETMTI) protocol for
large-scale RFID systems. In ETMTI, a new early-breaking estimation and
deactivation method is developed to effectively estimate the number of unknown
tags and deactivate them within a short time. Next, a new tree-splitting-based
missing tag identification method is proposed to quickly identify missing tags
with a B-ary splitting tree. Besides, a bit-tracking response strategy is
designed to further reduce the time cost. The optimal parameters, time cost,
and false negative rate of ETMTI are analyzed theoretically. Simulation results
are presented to demonstrate that the proposed ETMTI protocol takes a smaller
time and has a lower false negative rate than the best-performing benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">To successfully launch backdoor attacks, injected data needs to be correctly
labeled; otherwise, they can be easily detected by even basic data filters.
Hence, the concept of clean-label attacks was introduced, which is more
dangerous as it doesn't require changing the labels of injected data. To the
best of our knowledge, the existing clean-label backdoor attacks largely relies
on an understanding of the entire training set or a portion of it. However, in
practice, it is very difficult for attackers to have it because of training
datasets often collected from multiple independent sources. Unlike all current
clean-label attacks, we propose a novel clean label method called 'Poison Dart
Frog'. Poison Dart Frog does not require access to any training data; it only
necessitates knowledge of the target class for the attack, such as 'frog'. On
CIFAR10, Tiny-ImageNet, and TSRD, with a mere 0.1\%, 0.025\%, and 0.4\%
poisoning rate of the training set size, respectively, Poison Dart Frog
achieves a high Attack Success Rate compared to LC, HTBA, BadNets, and Blend.
Furthermore, compared to the state-of-the-art attack, NARCISSUS, Poison Dart
Frog achieves similar attack success rates without any training data. Finally,
we demonstrate that four typical backdoor defense algorithms struggle to
counter Poison Dart Frog.

<p class="mathjax">Dairy farming can be an energy intensive form of farming. Understanding the
factors affecting electricity consumption on dairy farms is crucial for farm
owners and energy providers. In order to accurately estimate electricity
demands in dairy farms, it is necessary to develop a model. In this research
paper, an agent-based model is proposed to model the electricity consumption of
Irish dairy farms. The model takes into account various factors that affect the
energy consumption of dairy farms, including herd size, number of milking
machines, and time of year. The outputs are validated using existing
state-of-the-art dairy farm modelling frameworks. The proposed agent-based
model is fully explainable, which is an advantage over other Artificial

multiple-input single-output (MISO) simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, which consists
of a STAR-RIS, an access point (AP), and reflection users and transmission
users with energy buffers. In the proposed system, the multi-antenna AP can
transmit information and energy to several single-antenna reflection and
transmission users simultaneously in a NOMA fashion, where the power transfer
and information transmission states of the users are modeled using Markov
chains. The reflection and transmission users harvest and store the energy in
energy buffers as additional power supplies. The power outage probability,
information outage probability, sum throughput, and joint outage probability
closed-form expressions of the proposed system are derived over Nakagami-m
fading channels, which are validated via simulations. Results demonstrate that
the proposed system achieves better performance in comparison to the STAR-RIS
aided MISO SWIPT-NOMA buffer-less, conventional RIS and energy buffer aided
MISO SWIPT-NOMA, and STAR-RIS and energy buffer aided MISO SWIPT-time-division
multiple access (TDMA) systems. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization
based power allocation (PSO-PA) algorithm is designed to maximize the sum
throughput with a constraint on the joint outage probability. Simulation
results illustrate that the proposed PSO-PA algorithm can achieve an improved

<p class="mathjax">The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced remarkable progress
in recent years, driven by the widespread adoption of open-source machine
learning models in both research and industry. Considering the
resource-intensive nature of training on vast datasets, many applications opt
for models that have already been trained. Hence, a small number of key players
undertake the responsibility of training and publicly releasing large
pre-trained models, providing a crucial foundation for a wide range of
applications. However, the adoption of these open-source models carries
inherent privacy and security risks that are often overlooked. To provide a
concrete example, an inconspicuous model may conceal hidden functionalities
that, when triggered by specific input patterns, can manipulate the behavior of
the system, such as instructing self-driving cars to ignore the presence of
other vehicles. The implications of successful privacy and security attacks
encompass a broad spectrum, ranging from relatively minor damage like service
interruptions to highly alarming scenarios, including physical harm or the
exposure of sensitive user data. In this work, we present a comprehensive
overview of common privacy and security threats associated with the use of
open-source models. By raising awareness of these dangers, we strive to promote
the responsible and secure use of AI systems.

and alternative communication (AAC) systems to have conversations and
communique their wants. Such systems allow message authoring by arranging
pictograms in sequence. However, the difficulty of finding the desired item to
complete a sentence can increase as the user's vocabulary increases. This paper
proposes using BERTimbau, a Brazilian Portuguese version of BERT, for pictogram
prediction in AAC systems. To finetune BERTimbau, we constructed an AAC corpus
for Brazilian Portuguese to use as a training corpus. We tested different
approaches to representing a pictogram for prediction: as a word (using
pictogram captions), as a concept (using a dictionary definition), and as a set
of synonyms (using related terms). We also evaluated the usage of images for
pictogram prediction. The results demonstrate that using embeddings computed
from the pictograms' caption, synonyms, or definitions have a similar
performance. Using synonyms leads to lower perplexity, but using captions leads
to the highest accuracies. This paper provides insight into how to represent a
pictogram for prediction using a BERT-like model and the potential of using
images for pictogram prediction.

usually built on strong assumptions, e.g., the domain invariant posterior
distribution, which is usually unsatisfied and may introduce noises, resulting
in poor generalization ability on target domains. Inspired by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) that aggregate information from neighboring nodes, we redefine
the paradigm as learning a knowledge-enhanced posterior distribution for target
domains, namely Knowledge Bridge Learning (KBL). KBL first learns the scope of
knowledge transfer by constructing a Bridged-Graph that connects knowledgeable
samples to each target sample and then performs sample-wise knowledge transfer
via GNNs.KBL is free from strong assumptions and is robust to noises in the
source data. Guided by KBL, we propose the Bridged-GNN} including an Adaptive
Knowledge Retrieval module to build Bridged-Graph and a Graph Knowledge
Transfer module. Comprehensive experiments on both un-relational and relational
data-hungry scenarios demonstrate the significant improvements of Bridged-GNN
compared with SOTA methods

<p class="mathjax">One major problem in the study of numerical semigroups is determining the
growth of the semigroup tree. In the present work, infinite chains of numerical
semigroups in the semigroup tree, firstly introduced in Bras-Amor\'os and
Nulygin (2009), are studied. Computational results show that these chains are
rare, but without them the tree would not be infinite. It is proved that for
each genus $g\geq 5$ there are more semigroups of that genus not belonging to
infinite chains than semigroups belonging. The reference Bras-Amor\'os and
Bulygin (2009) presented a characterization of the semigroups that belong to
infinite chains in terms of the coprimality of the left elements of the
semigroup as well as a result on the cardinality of the set of infinite chains
to which a numerical semigroup belongs in terms of the primality of the
greatest common divisor of these left elements. We revisit these results and
fix an imprecision on the cardinality of the set of infinite chains to which a
semigroup belongs in the case when the greatest common divisor of the left
elements is a prime number. We then look at infinite chains in subtrees with
fixed multiplicity. When the multiplicity is a prime number there is only one
infinite chain in the tree of semigroups with such multiplicity. When the
multpliplicity is $4$ or $6$ we prove a self-replication behavior in the
subtree and prove a formula for the number of semigroups in infinite chains of
a given genus and multiplicity $4$ and $6$, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Knop and Schierreich [AAMAS '23] recently introduced a novel model of refugee
housing and specifically asked for the computational complexity picture of the
following variant. Given a topology modelled as an undirected graph, a set of
inhabitants, a number of refugees $R$, an assignment of inhabitants to houses
of the topology, and an upper-bound for every inhabitant, find a set $\pi$ of
unoccupied houses of size $R$ intended such that the number of refugees in the
neighbourhood of every inhabitant is at most its upper-bound. If such a set
$\pi$ exists, we say that the instance admits an inhabitant-respecting housing.
<br />In this paper, we show that the existence of inhabitant-respecting housing is
not guaranteed even under several further restrictions of the upper-bounds.
Then, we focus on the computational complexity of deciding whether
inhabitant-respecting housing exists. To this end, we provide tractable
algorithms for several restrictions of the topology. We complement these
results with appropriate hardness results and running-time lower-bounds.
Furthermore, we introduce a relaxed (or approximate) version of the
inhabitant-respecting housing, where we allow at most $t$ upper-bounds to be
exceeded.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluating semantic relatedness of Web resources is still an open challenge.
This paper focuses on knowledge-based methods, which represent an alternative
to corpus-based approaches, and rely in general on the availability of
knowledge graphs. In particular, we have selected 10 methods from the existing
literature, that have been organized according to it adjacent resources, triple
patterns, and triple weights-based methods. They have been implemented and
evaluated by using DBpedia as reference RDF knowledge graph. Since DBpedia is
continuously evolving, the experimental results provided by these methods in
the literature are not comparable. For this reason, in this work, such methods
have been experimented by running them all at once on the same DBpedia release
and against 14 well-known golden datasets. On the basis of the correlation
values with human judgment obtained according to the experimental results,
weighting the RDF triples in combination with evaluating all the directed paths
linking the compared resources is the best strategy in order to compute
semantic relatedness in DBpedia.

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate B-splines and Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) lack
adaptivity due to their tensor product structure. Truncated hierarchical
B-splines (THB-splines) provide a solution for this. THB-splines organize the
parameter space into a hierarchical structure, which enables efficient
approximation and representation of functions with different levels of detail.
The truncation mechanism ensures the partition of unity property of B-splines
and defines a more scattered set of basis functions without overlapping on the
multi-level spline space. Transferring these multi-level splines into B\'ezier
elements representation facilitates straightforward incorporation into existing
finite element (FE) codes. By separating the multi-level extraction of the
THB-splines from the standard B\'ezier extraction, a more general independent
framework applicable to any sequence of nested spaces is created. The operators
for the multi-level structure of THB-splines and the operators of B\'ezier
extraction are constructed in a local approach. Adjusting the operators for the
multi-level structure from an element point of view and multiplying with the
B\'ezier extraction operators of those elements, a direct map between B\'ezier
elements and a hierarchical structure is obtained. The presented implementation
involves the use of an open-source Octave/MATLAB isogeometric analysis (IGA)
code called GeoPDEs. A basic Poisson problem is presented to investigate the
performance of multi-level B\'ezier extraction compared to a standard
THB-spline approach.

<p class="mathjax">This work focuses on pose-following, a variant of path-following in which the
goal is to steer the system's position and attitude along a path with a moving
frame attached to it. Full body motion control, while accounting for the
additional freedom to self-regulate the progress along the path, is an
appealing trade-off. Towards this end, we extend the well-established dual
quaternion-based pose-tracking method into a pose-following control law.
Specifically, we derive the equations of motion for the full pose error between
the geometric reference and the rigid body in the form of a dual quaternion and
dual twist. Subsequently, we formulate an almost globally asymptotically stable
control law. The global attractivity of the presented approach is validated in
a spatial example, while its benefits over pose-tracking are showcased through
a planar case-study.

<p class="mathjax">This paper accelerates video perception, such as semantic segmentation and
human pose estimation, by levering cross-frame redundancies. Unlike the
existing approaches, which avoid redundant computations by warping the past
features using optical-flow or by performing sparse convolutions on frame
differences, we approach the problem from a new perspective: low-bit
quantization. We observe that residuals, as the difference in network
activations between two neighboring frames, exhibit properties that make them
highly quantizable. Based on this observation, we propose a novel quantization
scheme for video networks coined as Residual Quantization. ResQ extends the
standard, frame-by-frame, quantization scheme by incorporating temporal
dependencies that lead to better performance in terms of accuracy vs.
bit-width. Furthermore, we extend our model to dynamically adjust the bit-width
proportional to the amount of changes in the video. We demonstrate the
superiority of our model, against the standard quantization and existing
efficient video perception models, using various architectures on semantic
segmentation and human pose estimation benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology which enables a local movement
of the antenna in the transmitter/receiver region for improving the channel
condition and communication performance. In this paper, we study the deployment
of multiple MAs at the base station (BS) for enhancing the multiuser
communication performance. First, we model the multiuser channel in the uplink
to characterize the wireless channel variation due to MAs' movements at the BS.
Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable
rate among multiple users for MA-aided uplink multiuser communications by
jointly optimizing the MAs' positions, their receive combining at the BS, and
the transmit power of users, under the constraints of finite moving region for
MAs, minimum inter-MA distance, and maximum transmit power of each user. To
solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, a two-loop iterative
algorithm is proposed by leveraging the particle swarm optimization (PSO)
method. Specifically, the outer-loop updates the positions of a set of
particles, where each particle's position represents one realization of the
antenna position vector (APV) of all MAs. The inner-loop implements the fitness
evaluation for each particle in terms of the max-min achievable rate of
multiple users with its corresponding APV, where the receive combining matrix
of the BS and the transmit power of each user are optimized by applying the
block coordinate descent (BCD) technique. Simulation results show that the
antenna position optimization for MAs-aided BSs can significantly improve the
rate performance as compared to conventional BSs with fixed-position antennas
(FPAs).

We show that the same models generalize well to widely-used evaluation

<p class="mathjax">In natural language processing (NLP) of spoken languages, word embeddings
have been shown to be a useful method to encode the meaning of words. Sign
languages are visual languages, which require sign embeddings to capture the
visual and linguistic semantics of sign. Unlike many common approaches to Sign
Recognition, we focus on explicitly creating sign embeddings that bridge the
gap between sign language and spoken language. We propose a learning framework
to derive LCC (Learnt Contrastive Concept) embeddings for sign language, a
weakly supervised contrastive approach to learning sign embeddings. We train a
vocabulary of embeddings that are based on the linguistic labels for sign
video. Additionally, we develop a conceptual similarity loss which is able to
utilise word embeddings from NLP methods to create sign embeddings that have
better sign language to spoken language correspondence. These learnt
representations allow the model to automatically localise the sign in time. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art keypoint-based sign recognition performance
on the WLASL and BOBSL datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems may suffer from congestion, meaning that there is an
unequal distribution of the items in how often they are recommended. Some items
may be recommended much more than others. Recommenders are increasingly used in
domains where items have limited availability, such as the job market, where
congestion is especially problematic: Recommending a vacancy -- for which
typically only one person will be hired -- to a large number of job seekers may
lead to frustration for job seekers, as they may be applying for jobs where
they are not hired. This may also leave vacancies unfilled and result in job
market inefficiency.
<br />We propose a novel approach to job recommendation called ReCon, accounting
for the congestion problem. Our approach is to use an optimal transport
component to ensure a more equal spread of vacancies over job seekers, combined
with a job recommendation model in a multi-objective optimization problem. We
evaluated our approach on two real-world job market datasets. The evaluation
results show that ReCon has good performance on both congestion-related (e.g.,
Congestion) and desirability (e.g., NDCG) measures.

<p class="mathjax">Graph representation learning (GRL) methods, such as graph neural networks
and graph transformer models, have been successfully used to analyze
graph-structured data, mainly focusing on node classification and link
prediction tasks. However, the existing studies mostly only consider local
connectivity while ignoring long-range connectivity and the roles of nodes. In
this paper, we propose Unified Graph Transformer Networks (UGT) that
effectively integrate local and global structural information into fixed-length
vector representations. First, UGT learns local structure by identifying the
local substructures and aggregating features of the $k$-hop neighborhoods of
each node. Second, we construct virtual edges, bridging distant nodes with
structural similarity to capture the long-range dependencies. Third, UGT learns
unified representations through self-attention, encoding structural distance
and $p$-step transition probability between node pairs. Furthermore, we propose
a self-supervised learning task that effectively learns transition probability
to fuse local and global structural features, which could then be transferred
to other downstream tasks. Experimental results on real-world benchmark
datasets over various downstream tasks showed that UGT significantly
outperformed baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models. In addition,
UGT reaches the expressive power of the third-order Weisfeiler-Lehman
isomorphism test (3d-WL) in distinguishing non-isomorphic graph pairs. The

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of aligning real-world 3D data of garments, which
benefits many applications such as texture learning, physical parameter
estimation, generative modeling of garments, etc. Existing extrinsic methods
typically perform non-rigid iterative closest point and struggle to align
details due to incorrect closest matches and rigidity constraints. While
intrinsic methods based on functional maps can produce high-quality
correspondences, they work under isometric assumptions and become unreliable
for garment deformations which are highly non-isometric. To achieve
wrinkle-level as well as texture-level alignment, we present a novel
coarse-to-fine two-stage method that leverages intrinsic manifold properties
with two neural deformation fields, in the 3D space and the intrinsic space,
respectively. The coarse stage performs a 3D fitting, where we leverage
intrinsic manifold properties to define a manifold deformation field. The
coarse fitting then induces a functional map that produces an alignment of
intrinsic embeddings. We further refine the intrinsic alignment with a second
neural deformation field for higher accuracy. We evaluate our method with our
captured garment dataset, GarmCap. The method achieves accurate wrinkle-level
and texture-level alignment and works for difficult garment types such as long
coats. Our project page is

<p class="mathjax">The 2nd International Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense was held at the
Florida Institute of Technology, Florida. This workshop was organized to share
research that explores unique applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) as foundational capabilities for the pursuit of adaptive
cyber defense. The cyber domain cannot currently be reliably and effectively
defended without extensive reliance on human experts. Skilled cyber defenders
are in short supply and often cannot respond fast enough to cyber threats.
<br />Building on recent advances in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community
has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable defenses through the
adoption of AI and ML techniques to cyber settings. Bridging critical gaps
between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate efforts to
create semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize and respond
to cyber attacks or discover and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation with other
cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore, these defenses are
expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart changes in
attacker behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and natural
shifts in user behavior over time.
<br />The workshop was comprised of invited keynote talks, technical presentations
and a panel discussion about how AI/ML can enable autonomous mitigation of
current and future cyber attacks. Workshop submissions were peer reviewed by a
panel of domain experts with a proceedings consisting of six technical articles
exploring challenging problems of critical importance to national and global
security. Participation in this workshop offered new opportunities to stimulate
research and innovation in the emerging domain of adaptive and autonomous cyber
defense.

<p class="mathjax">This manuscript presents novel techniques for identifying the switch states,
phase identification, and estimation of equipment parameters in multi-phase low
voltage electrical grids, which is a major challenge in long-standing German
low voltage grids that lack observability and are heavily impacted by modelling
errors. The proposed methods are tailored for systems with a limited number of
spatially distributed measuring devices, which measure voltage magnitudes at
specific nodes and some line current magnitudes. The overall approach employs a
problem decomposition strategy to divide the problem into smaller subproblems,
which are addressed independently. The techniques for identifying switch states
and system phases are based on heuristics and a binary optimization problem
using correlation analysis of the measured time series. The estimation of
equipment parameters is achieved through a data-driven regression approach and
by an optimization problem, and the identification of cable types is solved
using a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming solver. To validate the presented
methods, a realistic grid is used and the presented techniques are evaluated
for their resilience to data quality and time resolution, discussing the
limitations of the proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">The evolution of cybersecurity is undoubtedly associated and intertwined with
the development and improvement of artificial intelligence (AI). As a key tool
for realizing more cybersecure ecosystems, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)
have evolved tremendously in recent years by integrating machine learning (ML)
techniques for the detection of increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity
attacks hidden in big data. However, these approaches have traditionally been
based on centralized learning architectures, in which data from end nodes are
shared with data centers for analysis. Recently, the application of federated
learning (FL) in this context has attracted great interest to come up with
collaborative intrusion detection approaches where data does not need to be
shared. Due to the recent rise of this field, this work presents a complete,
contemporary taxonomy for FL-enabled IDS approaches that stems from a
comprehensive survey of the literature in the time span from 2018 to 2022.
Precisely, our discussion includes an analysis of the main ML models, datasets,
aggregation functions, as well as implementation libraries, which are employed
by the proposed FL-enabled IDS approaches. On top of everything else, we
provide a critical view of the current state of the research around this topic,
and describe the main challenges and future directions based on the analysis of
the literature and our own experience in this area.

<p class="mathjax">Hand pose estimation from a single image has many applications. However,
approaches to full 3D body pose estimation are typically trained on day-to-day
activities or actions. As such, detailed hand-to-hand interactions are poorly
represented, especially during motion. We see this in the failure cases of
techniques such as OpenPose or MediaPipe. However, accurate hand pose
estimation is crucial for many applications where the global body motion is
less important than accurate hand pose estimation.
<br />This paper addresses the problem of 3D hand pose estimation from monocular
images or sequences. We present a novel end-to-end framework for 3D hand
regression that employs diffusion models that have shown excellent ability to
capture the distribution of data for generative purposes. Moreover, we enforce
kinematic constraints to ensure realistic poses are generated by incorporating
an explicit forward kinematic layer as part of the network. The proposed model
provides state-of-the-art performance when lifting a 2D single-hand image to
3D. However, when sequence data is available, we add a Transformer module over
a temporal window of consecutive frames to refine the results, overcoming
jittering and further increasing accuracy.
<br />The method is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated showing
state-of-the-art robustness, generalization, and accuracy on several different
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">This work addresses 3D human pose reconstruction in single images. We present
a method that combines Forward Kinematics (FK) with neural networks to ensure a
fast and valid prediction of 3D pose. Pose is represented as a hierarchical
tree/graph with nodes corresponding to human joints that model their physical
limits. Given a 2D detection of keypoints in the image, we lift the skeleton to
3D using neural networks to predict both the joint rotations and bone lengths.
These predictions are then combined with skeletal constraints using an FK layer
implemented as a network layer in PyTorch. The result is a fast and accurate
approach to the estimation of 3D skeletal pose. Through quantitative and
qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the method is significantly more
accurate than MediaPipe in terms of both per joint positional error and visual
appearance. Furthermore, we demonstrate generalization over different datasets.
The implementation in PyTorch runs at between 100-200 milliseconds per image
(including CNN detection) using CPU only.

<p class="mathjax">The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection,
while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances.
Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and
object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the
paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To
alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework
tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and
Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to
ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the
dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the
conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate
the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in
an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised
contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When
integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A,
underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream
detection approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Channel charting is a self-supervised learning technique whose objective is
to reconstruct a map of the radio environment, called channel chart, by taking
advantage of similarity relationships in high-dimensional channel state
information. We provide an overview of processing steps and evaluation methods
for channel charting and propose a novel dissimilarity metric that takes into
account angular-domain information as well as a novel deep learning-based
metric. Furthermore, we suggest a method to fuse dissimilarity metrics such
that both the time at which channels were measured as well as similarities in
channel state information can be taken into consideration while learning a
channel chart. By applying both classical and deep learning-based manifold
learning to a dataset containing sub-6GHz distributed massive MIMO channel
measurements, we show that our metrics outperform previously proposed
dissimilarity measures. The results indicate that the new metrics improve
channel charting performance, even under non-line-of-sight conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot object detection aims to localize and recognize objects of unseen
classes. Most of existing works face two problems: the low recall of RPN in
unseen classes and the confusion of unseen classes with background. In this
paper, we present the first method that combines DETR and meta-learning to
perform zero-shot object detection, named Meta-ZSDETR, where model training is
formalized as an individual episode based meta-learning task. Different from
Faster R-CNN based methods that firstly generate class-agnostic proposals, and
then classify them with visual-semantic alignment module, Meta-ZSDETR directly
predict class-specific boxes with class-specific queries and further filter
them with the predicted accuracy from classification head. The model is
optimized with meta-contrastive learning, which contains a regression head to
generate the coordinates of class-specific boxes, a classification head to
predict the accuracy of generated boxes, and a contrastive head that utilizes
the proposed contrastive-reconstruction loss to further separate different
classes in visual space. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets MS COCO and PASCAL VOC. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms the existing ZSD methods by a large margin.

<p class="mathjax">Early diagnosis of prostate cancer is crucial for efficient treatment.
Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Images (mp-MRI) are widely used for lesion
detection. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) has
standardized interpretation of prostate MRI by defining a score for lesion
malignancy. PI-RADS data is readily available from radiology reports but is
subject to high inter-reports variability. We propose a new contrastive loss
function that leverages weak metadata with multiple annotators per sample and
takes advantage of inter-reports variability by defining metadata confidence.
By combining metadata of varying confidence with unannotated data into a single
conditional contrastive loss function, we report a 3% AUC increase on lesion
detection on the public PI-CAI challenge dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The impact of randomness on model training is poorly understood. How do
differences in data order and initialization actually manifest in the model,
such that some training runs outperform others or converge faster? Furthermore,
how can we interpret the resulting training dynamics and the phase transitions
that characterize different trajectories? To understand the effect of
randomness on the dynamics and outcomes of neural network training, we train
models multiple times with different random seeds and compute a variety of
metrics throughout training, such as the $L_2$ norm, mean, and variance of the
neural network's weights. We then fit a hidden Markov model (HMM) over the
resulting sequences of metrics. The HMM represents training as a stochastic
process of transitions between latent states, providing an intuitive overview
of significant changes during training. Using our method, we produce a
low-dimensional, discrete representation of training dynamics on grokking
tasks, image classification, and masked language modeling. We use the HMM
representation to study phase transitions and identify latent "detour" states
that slow down convergence.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we investigate exemplar-free class incremental learning (CIL)
with knowledge distillation (KD) as a regularization strategy, aiming to
prevent forgetting. KD-based methods are successfully used in CIL, but they
often struggle to regularize the model without access to exemplars of the
training data from previous tasks. Our analysis reveals that this issue
originates from substantial representation shifts in the teacher network when
dealing with out-of-distribution data. This causes large errors in the KD loss
component, leading to performance degradation in CIL. Inspired by recent
test-time adaptation methods, we introduce Teacher Adaptation (TA), a method
that concurrently updates the teacher and the main model during incremental
training. Our method seamlessly integrates with KD-based CIL approaches and
allows for consistent enhancement of their performance across multiple
exemplar-free CIL benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) provides diverse audio-to-text services
for humans to communicate with machines. However, recent research reveals ASR
systems are vulnerable to various malicious audio attacks. In particular, by
removing the non-essential frequency components, a new spectrum reduction
attack can generate adversarial audios that can be perceived by humans but
cannot be correctly interpreted by ASR systems. It raises a new challenge for
content moderation solutions to detect harmful content in audio and video
available on social media platforms. In this paper, we propose an acoustic
compensation system named ACE to counter the spectrum reduction attacks over
ASR systems. Our system design is based on two observations, namely, frequency
component dependencies and perturbation sensitivity. First, since the Discrete
Fourier Transform computation inevitably introduces spectral leakage and
aliasing effects to the audio frequency spectrum, the frequency components with
similar frequencies will have a high correlation. Thus, considering the
intrinsic dependencies between neighboring frequency components, it is possible
to recover more of the original audio by compensating for the removed
components based on the remaining ones. Second, since the removed components in
the spectrum reduction attacks can be regarded as an inverse of adversarial
noise, the attack success rate will decrease when the adversarial audio is
replayed in an over-the-air scenario. Hence, we can model the acoustic
propagation process to add over-the-air perturbations into the attacked audio.
We implement a prototype of ACE and the experiments show ACE can effectively
reduce up to 87.9% of ASR inference errors caused by spectrum reduction
attacks. Also, by analyzing residual errors, we summarize six general types of
ASR inference errors and investigate the error causes and potential mitigation
solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Context. Refactoring has been widely investigated in the past in relation to
production code quality, yet still little is known on how developers apply
refactoring on test code. Specifically, there is still a lack of investigation
into how developers typically refactor test code and its effects on test code
quality and effectiveness. Objective. This paper presents a research agenda
aimed to bridge this gap of knowledge by investigating (1) whether test
refactoring actually targets test classes affected by quality and effectiveness
concerns and (2) the extent to which refactoring contributes to the improvement
of test code quality and effectiveness. Method. We plan to conduct an
exploratory mining software repository study to collect test refactoring data
of open-source Java projects from GitHub and statistically analyze them in
combination with quality metrics, test smells, and code/mutation coverage
indicators. Furthermore, we will measure how refactoring operations impact the
quality and effectiveness of test code.

that there exists a probabilistic Turing machine running within time $O(n^k)$
for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_1$ accepting a language $L_d$ which is different from
any language in $\mathcal{P}$, and then to show that $L_d\in\mathcal{BPP}$,
thus separating the complexity classes $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{BPP}$ (i.e.,
$\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BPP}$). Since the complexity class of {\em
bounded error quantum polynomial-time} $\mathcal{BQP}$ contains the complexity
class $\mathcal{BPP}$, i.e., $\mathcal{BPP}\subseteq\mathcal{BQP}$, we thus
obtain the result that quantum computers are {\em rigorously powerful than}

show that (1). $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{RP}$; (2).
$\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\text{co-}\mathcal{RP}$; (3).
$\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{ZPP}$.
<br />The result of $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BPP}$ shows that {\em

Specifically, we show that: (1). The number of random bits used by any
probabilistic algorithm which accepts the language $L_d$ can not be reduced to
$O(\log n)$; (2). There exits no efficient (complexity-theoretic) {\em
pseudorandom generator} (PRG) $G:\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$;
(3). There exists no quick HSG $H:k(n)\rightarrow n$ such that $k(n)=O(\log

<p class="mathjax">The success of machine learning (ML) has been accompanied by increased
concerns about its trustworthiness. Several jurisdictions are preparing ML
regulatory frameworks. One such concern is ensuring that model training data
has desirable distributional properties for certain sensitive attributes. For
example, draft regulations indicate that model trainers are required to show
that training datasets have specific distributional properties, such as
reflecting diversity of the population.
<br />We propose the notion of property attestation allowing a prover (e.g., model
trainer) to demonstrate relevant distributional properties of training data to
a verifier (e.g., a customer) without revealing the data. We present an
effective hybrid property attestation combining property inference with
cryptographic mechanisms.

<p class="mathjax">A minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) maps a set $S$ of $n$ keys to the
first $n$ integers without collisions. There is a lower bound of
$n\log_2e-O(\log n)$ bits of space needed to represent an MPHF. A matching
upper bound is obtained using the brute-force algorithm that tries random hash
functions until stumbling on an MPHF and stores that function's seed. In
expectation, $e^n\textrm{poly}(n)$ seeds need to be tested. The most
space-efficient previous algorithms for constructing MPHFs all use such a
brute-force approach as a basic building block.
<br />In this paper, we introduce ShockHash - Small, heavily overloaded cuckoo hash
tables. ShockHash uses two hash functions $h_0$ and $h_1$, hoping for the
existence of a function $f : S \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ such that $x \mapsto
h_{f(x)}(x)$ is an MPHF on $S$. In graph terminology, ShockHash generates
$n$-edge random graphs until stumbling on a pseudoforest - a graph where each
component contains as many edges as nodes. Using cuckoo hashing, ShockHash then
derives an MPHF from the pseudoforest in linear time. It uses a 1-bit retrieval
data structure to store $f$ using $n + o(n)$ bits.
<br />By carefully analyzing the probability that a random graph is a pseudoforest,
we show that ShockHash needs to try only $(e/2)^n\textrm{poly}(n)$ hash
function seeds in expectation, reducing the space for storing the seed by
roughly $n$ bits. This makes ShockHash almost a factor $2^n$ faster than
brute-force, while maintaining the asymptotically optimal space consumption. An
implementation within the RecSplit framework yields the currently most space
efficient MPHFs, i.e., competing approaches need about two orders of magnitude
more work to achieve the same space.

<p class="mathjax">Query-based object detectors directly decode image features into object
instances with a set of learnable queries. These query vectors are
progressively refined to stable meaningful representations through a sequence
of decoder layers, and then used to directly predict object locations and
categories with simple FFN heads. In this paper, we present a new query-based
object detector (DEQDet) by designing a deep equilibrium decoder. Our DEQ
decoder models the query vector refinement as the fixed point solving of an
{implicit} layer and is equivalent to applying {infinite} steps of refinement.
To be more specific to object decoding, we use a two-step unrolled equilibrium
equation to explicitly capture the query vector refinement. Accordingly, we are
able to incorporate refinement awareness into the DEQ training with the inexact
gradient back-propagation (RAG). In addition, to stabilize the training of our
DEQDet and improve its generalization ability, we devise the deep supervision
scheme on the optimization path of DEQ with refinement-aware
perturbation~(RAP). Our experiments demonstrate DEQDet converges faster,
consumes less memory, and achieves better results than the baseline counterpart
(AdaMixer). In particular, our DEQDet with ResNet50 backbone and 300 queries
achieves the $49.5$ mAP and $33.0$ AP$_s$ on the MS COCO benchmark under
$2\times$ training scheme (24 epochs).

<p class="mathjax">Layer normalization (LN) is a widely adopted deep learning technique
especially in the era of foundation models. Recently, LN has been shown to be
surprisingly effective in federated learning (FL) with non-i.i.d. data.
However, exactly why and how it works remains mysterious. In this work, we
reveal the profound connection between layer normalization and the label shift
problem in federated learning. To understand layer normalization better in FL,
we identify the key contributing mechanism of normalization methods in FL,
called feature normalization (FN), which applies normalization to the latent
feature representation before the classifier head. Although LN and FN do not
improve expressive power, they control feature collapse and local overfitting
to heavily skewed datasets, and thus accelerates global training. Empirically,
we show that normalization leads to drastic improvements on standard benchmarks
under extreme label shift. Moreover, we conduct extensive ablation studies to
understand the critical factors of layer normalization in FL. Our results
verify that FN is an essential ingredient inside LN to significantly improve
the convergence of FL while remaining robust to learning rate choices,
especially under extreme label shift where each client has access to few
classes.

<p class="mathjax">Visual localization plays a critical role in the functionality of low-cost
autonomous mobile robots. Current state-of-the-art approaches to accurate
visual localization are 3D scene-specific, requiring additional computational
and storage resources to construct a 3D scene model when facing a new
environment. An alternative approach of directly using a database of 2D images
for visual localization offers more flexibility. However, such methods
currently suffer from limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose
a robust and accurate multiple checking-based 3D model-free visual localization
system that addresses the aforementioned issues. The core idea is to model the
local planar motion characteristic of general ground-moving robots into both
essential matrix estimation and triangulation stages to obtain two minimal
solutions. By embedding the proposed minimal solutions into the multiple
checking scheme, the proposed 3D model-free visual localization framework
demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in both simulation and real-world
experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Recent developments of multi-modal large language models have demonstrated
its strong ability in solving vision-language tasks. In this paper, we focus on
the product understanding task, which plays an essential role in enhancing
online shopping experience. Product understanding task includes a variety of
sub-tasks, which require models to respond diverse queries based on multi-modal
product information. Traditional methods design distinct model architectures
for each sub-task. On the contrary, we present PUMGPT, a large vision-language
model aims at unifying all product understanding tasks under a singular model
structure. To bridge the gap between vision and text representations, we
propose Layer-wise Adapters (LA), an approach that provides enhanced alignment
with fewer visual tokens and enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Moreover,
the inherent parameter-efficient fine-tuning ability allows PUMGPT to be
readily adapted to new product understanding tasks and emerging products. We
design instruction templates to generate diverse product instruction datasets.
Simultaneously, we utilize open-domain datasets during training to improve the
performance of PUMGPT and its generalization ability. Through extensive
evaluations, PUMGPT demonstrates its superior performance across multiple
product understanding tasks, including product captioning, category
question-answering, attribute extraction, attribute question-answering, and
even free-form question-answering about products.

<p class="mathjax">For decades, database research has focused on optimizing performance under
fixed resources. As more and more database applications move to the public
cloud, we argue that it is time to make cost a first-class citizen when solving
database optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of cost
intelligence and envision the architecture of a cloud data warehouse designed
for that. We investigate two critical challenges to achieving cost intelligence
in an analytical system: automatic resource deployment and cost-oriented
auto-tuning. We describe our system architecture with an emphasis on the
components that are missing in today's cloud data warehouses. Each of these new
components represents unique research opportunities in this much-needed
research area.

<p class="mathjax">In the past, the dichotomy between homophily and heterophily has inspired
research contributions toward a better understanding of Deep Graph Networks'
inductive bias. In particular, it was believed that homophily strongly
correlates with better node classification predictions of message-passing
methods. More recently, however, researchers pointed out that such dichotomy is
too simplistic as we can construct node classification tasks where graphs are
completely heterophilic but the performances remain high. Most of these works
have also proposed new quantitative metrics to understand when a graph
structure is useful, which implicitly or explicitly assume the correlation
between node features and target labels. Our work empirically investigates what
happens when this strong assumption does not hold, by formalising two
generative processes for node classification tasks that allow us to build and
study ad-hoc problems. To quantitatively measure the influence of the node
features on the target labels, we also use a metric we call Feature
Informativeness. We construct six synthetic tasks and evaluate the performance
of six models, including structure-agnostic ones. Our findings reveal that
previously defined metrics are not adequate when we relax the above assumption.
Our contribution to the workshop aims at presenting novel research findings
that could help advance our understanding of the field.

<p class="mathjax">Partial differential equations (PDEs) can describe many relevant phenomena in
dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine
formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially
relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial
conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent
years, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for
problems of this kind. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often
suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense
collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this
problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as
a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original
problem space. PIBI-Nets only need collocation points at the computational
domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results, and in several
practical settings, they clearly outperform PINNs. Exploiting elementary
properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we
present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse
problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI-Nets for the Laplace
and Poisson equations, both on artificial data sets and within a real-world
application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.

<p class="mathjax">StackOverflow (SO) is a widely used question-and-answer (Q\&amp;A) website for
software developers and computer scientists. GitHub is an online development
platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
Prior work relates the information mined from both platforms to link user
accounts or compare developers' activities across platforms. However, not much
work is done to characterize the SO answers reused by GitHub projects. For this
paper, we did an empirical study by mining the SO answers reused by Java
projects available on GitHub. We created a hybrid approach of clone detection,
keyword-based search, and manual inspection, to identify the answer(s) actually
leveraged by developers. Based on the identified answers, we further studied
topics of the discussion threads, answer characteristics (e.g., scores, ages,
code lengths, and text lengths), and developers' reuse practices.
<br />We observed that most reused answers offer programs to implement specific
coding tasks. Among all analyzed SO discussion threads, the reused answers
often have relatively higher scores, older ages, longer code, and longer text
than unused answers. In only 9% of scenarios (40/430), developers fully copied
answer code for reuse. In the remaining scenarios, they reused partial code or
created brand new code from scratch. Our study characterized 130 SO discussion
threads referred to by Java developers in 357 GitHub projects. Our empirical
findings can guide SO answerers to provide better answers, and shed lights on
future research related to SO and GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud virtualization technology, ingrained with physical resource sharing,
prompts cybersecurity threats on users' virtual machines (VM)s due to the
presence of inevitable vulnerabilities on the offsite servers. Contrary to the
existing works which concentrated on reducing resource sharing and encryption
and decryption of data before transfer for improving cybersecurity which raises
computational cost overhead, the proposed model operates diversely for
efficiently serving the same purpose. This paper proposes a novel Multiple
Risks Analysis based VM Threat Prediction Model (MR-TPM) to secure
computational data and minimize adversary breaches by proactively estimating
the VMs threats. It considers multiple cybersecurity risk factors associated
with the configuration and management of VMs, along with analysis of users'
behaviour. All these threat factors are quantified for the generation of
respective risk score values and fed as input into a machine learning based
classifier to estimate the probability of threat for each VM. The performance
of MR-TPM is evaluated using benchmark Google Cluster and OpenNebula VM threat
traces. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
efficiently computes the cybersecurity risks and learns the VM threat patterns
from historical and live data samples. The deployment of MR-TPM with existing
VM allocation policies reduces cybersecurity threats up to 88.9%.

<p class="mathjax">Given a family $X$ of subsets of $[n]$ and an ensemble of local functions
$\{f_s:s\to\Sigma\; | \; s\in X\}$, an agreement test is a randomized property
tester that is supposed to test whether there is some global function
$G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $f_s=G|_s$ for many sets $s$. A "classical"
small-soundness agreement theorem is a list-decoding $(LD)$ statement, saying
that \[\tag{$LD$} Agree(\{f_s\}) &gt; \varepsilon \quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\exists G^1,\dots, G^\ell,\quad P_s[f_s\overset{0.99}{\approx}G^i|_s]\geq
poly(\varepsilon),\;i=1,\dots,\ell. \] Such a statement is motivated by PCP
questions and has been shown in the case where $X=\binom{[n]}k$, or where $X$
is a collection of low dimensional subspaces of a vector space.
<br />In this work we study small the case of on high dimensional expanders $X$. It
has been an open challenge to analyze their small soundness behavior.
Surprisingly, the small soundness behavior turns out to be governed by the
topological covers of $X$.We show that:
<br />1. If $X$ has no connected covers, then $(LD)$ holds, provided that $X$
satisfies an additional expansion property.
<br />2. If $X$ has a connected cover, then $(LD)$ necessarily fails.
<br />3. If $X$ has a connected cover (and assuming the additional expansion
property), we replace the $(LD)$ by a weaker statement we call lift-decoding:
<br />\[ \tag{$LFD$}
<br />Agree(\{f_s\})&gt; \varepsilon \Longrightarrow \quad \exists\text{ cover
}\rho:Y\twoheadrightarrow X,\text{ and }G:Y(0)\to\Sigma,\text{ such that }\]
\[P_{{\tilde s\twoheadrightarrow s}}[f_s \overset{0.99}{\approx} G|_{\tilde s}]
\geq poly(\varepsilon),\] where ${\tilde s\twoheadrightarrow s}$ means that
$\rho(\tilde s)=s$.
<br />The additional expansion property is cosystolic expansion of a complex
derived from $X$ holds for the spherical building and for quotients of the
Bruhat-Tits building.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable
performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging
mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only
pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.
In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical reasoning
abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from
Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive
experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we
reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. WizardMath surpasses all
other open-source LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even
outperforms ChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k,
simultaneously surpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More

<p class="mathjax">Occlusion is a common issue in 3D reconstruction from RGB-D videos, often
blocking the complete reconstruction of objects and presenting an ongoing
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, empowered by a 2D
diffusion-based in-painting model, to reconstruct complete surfaces for the
hidden parts of objects. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained diffusion model
to fill in the hidden areas of 2D images. Then we use these in-painted images
to optimize a neural implicit surface representation for each instance for 3D
reconstruction. Since creating the in-painting masks needed for this process is
tricky, we adopt a human-in-the-loop strategy that involves very little human
engagement to generate high-quality masks. Moreover, some parts of objects can
be totally hidden because the videos are usually shot from limited
perspectives. To ensure recovering these invisible areas, we develop a cascaded
network architecture for predicting signed distance field, making use of
different frequency bands of positional encoding and maintaining overall
smoothness. Besides the commonly used rendering loss, Eikonal loss, and
silhouette loss, we adopt a CLIP-based semantic consistency loss to guide the
surface from unseen camera angles. Experiments on ScanNet scenes show that our
proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and completeness in
object-level reconstruction from scene-level RGB-D videos.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion-based methods can generate realistic images and videos, but they
struggle to edit existing objects in a video while preserving their appearance
over time. This prevents diffusion models from being applied to natural video
editing in practical scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
introducing temporal dependency to existing text-driven diffusion models, which
allows them to generate consistent appearance for the edited objects.
Specifically, we develop a novel inter-frame propagation mechanism for
diffusion video editing, which leverages the concept of layered representations
to propagate the appearance information from one frame to the next. We then
build up a text-driven video editing framework based on this mechanism, namely
StableVideo, which can achieve consistency-aware video editing. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the strong editing capability of our approach. Compared
with state-of-the-art video editing methods, our approach shows superior
qualitative and quantitative results. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of deep learning technology in the past decade,
appearance-based gaze estimation has attracted great attention from both
computer vision and human-computer interaction research communities.
Fascinating methods were proposed with variant mechanisms including soft
attention, hard attention, two-eye asymmetry, feature disentanglement, rotation
consistency, and contrastive learning. Most of these methods take the
single-face or multi-region as input, yet the basic architecture of gaze
estimation has not been fully explored. In this paper, we reveal the fact that
tuning a few simple parameters of a ResNet architecture can outperform most of
the existing state-of-the-art methods for the gaze estimation task on three
popular datasets. With our extensive experiments, we conclude that the stride
number, input image resolution, and multi-region architecture are critical for
the gaze estimation performance while their effectiveness dependent on the
quality of the input face image. We obtain the state-of-the-art performances on
three datasets with 3.64 on ETH-XGaze, 4.50 on MPIIFaceGaze, and 9.13 on
Gaze360 degrees gaze estimation error by taking ResNet-50 as the backbone.

<p class="mathjax">Robustly cooperating with unseen agents and human partners presents
significant challenges due to the diverse cooperative conventions these
partners may adopt. Existing Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT) methods address this
challenge by training an agent with a population of diverse teammate policies
obtained through maximizing specific diversity metrics. However, these
heuristic diversity metrics do not always maximize the agent's robustness in
all cooperative problems. In this work, we first propose that maximizing an AHT
agent's robustness requires it to emulate policies in the minimum coverage set
(MCS), the set of best-response policies to any partner policies in the
environment. We then introduce the L-BRDiv algorithm that generates a set of
teammate policies that, when used for AHT training, encourage agents to emulate
policies from the MCS. L-BRDiv works by solving a constrained optimization
problem to jointly train teammate policies for AHT training and approximating
AHT agent policies that are members of the MCS. We empirically demonstrate that
L-BRDiv produces more robust AHT agents than state-of-the-art methods in a
broader range of two-player cooperative problems without the need for extensive
hyperparameter tuning for its objectives. Our study shows that L-BRDiv
outperforms the baseline methods by prioritizing discovering distinct members
of the MCS instead of repeatedly finding redundant policies.

<p class="mathjax">Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical human
applications for predicting node labels in attributed graphs. Their ability to
aggregate features from nodes' neighbors for accurate classification also has
the capacity to exacerbate existing biases in data or to introduce new ones
towards members from protected demographic groups. Thus, it is imperative to
quantify how GNNs may be biased and to what extent their harmful effects may be
mitigated. To this end, we propose two new GNN-agnostic interventions namely,
(i) PFR-AX which decreases the separability between nodes in protected and
non-protected groups, and (ii) PostProcess which updates model predictions
based on a blackbox policy to minimize differences between error rates across
demographic groups. Through a large set of experiments on four datasets, we
frame the efficacies of our approaches (and three variants) in terms of their
algorithmic fairness-accuracy tradeoff and benchmark our results against three
strong baseline interventions on three state-of-the-art GNN models. Our results
show that no single intervention offers a universally optimal tradeoff, but
PFR-AX and PostProcess provide granular control and improve model confidence
when correctly predicting positive outcomes for nodes in protected groups.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling complex systems that consist of different types of objects leads to
multilayer networks, in which vertices are connected by both inter-layer and
intra-layer edges. In this paper, we investigate multiplex networks, in which
vertices in different layers are identified with each other, and the only
inter-layer edges are those that connect a vertex with its copy in other
layers. Let the third-order adjacency tensor $\mathcal{A}\in\R^{N\times N\times
L}$ and the parameter $\gamma\geq 0$, which is associated with the ease of
communication between layers, represent a multiplex network with $N$ vertices
and $L$ layers. To measure the ease of communication in a multiplex network, we
focus on the average inverse geodesic length, which we refer to as the
multiplex global efficiency $e_\mathcal{A}(\gamma)$ by means of the multiplex
path length matrix $P\in\R^{N\times N}$. This paper generalizes the approach
proposed in \cite{NR23} for single-layer networks. We describe an algorithm
based on min-plus matrix multiplication to construct $P$, as well as variants
$P^K$ that only take into account multiplex paths made up of at most $K$
intra-layer edges. These matrices are applied to detect redundant edges and to
determine non-decreasing lower bounds $e_\mathcal{A}^K(\gamma)$ for
$e_\mathcal{A}(\gamma)$, for $K=1,2,\dots,N-2$.
<br />Finally, the sensitivity of $e_\mathcal{A}^K(\gamma)$ to changes of the
entries of the adjacency tensor $\mathcal{A}$ is investigated to determine
edges that should be strengthened to enhance the multiplex global efficiency
the most.

<p class="mathjax">Visual grounding (VG) tasks involve explicit cross-modal alignment, as
semantically corresponding image regions are to be located for the language
phrases provided. Existing approaches complete such visual-text reasoning in a
single-step manner. Their performance causes high demands on large-scale
anchors and over-designed multi-modal fusion modules based on human priors,
leading to complicated frameworks that may be difficult to train and overfit to
specific scenarios. Even worse, such once-for-all reasoning mechanisms are
incapable of refining boxes continuously to enhance query-region matching. In
contrast, in this paper, we formulate an iterative reasoning process by
denoising diffusion modeling. Specifically, we propose a language-guided
diffusion framework for visual grounding, LG-DVG, which trains the model to
progressively reason queried object boxes by denoising a set of noisy boxes
with the language guide. To achieve this, LG-DVG gradually perturbs
query-aligned ground truth boxes to noisy ones and reverses this process step
by step, conditional on query semantics. Extensive experiments for our proposed
framework on five widely used datasets validate the superior performance of
solving visual grounding, a cross-modal alignment task, in a generative way.

<p class="mathjax">The concept of k-core plays an important role in measuring the cohesiveness
and engagement of a network. And recent studies have shown the vulnerability of
k-core under adversarial attacks. However, there are few researchers
concentrating on the vulnerability of individual nodes within k-core.
Therefore, in this paper, we attempt to study Targeted k-Nodes Collapse Problem
(TNsCP), which focuses on removing a minimal size set of edges to make multiple
target k-nodes collapse. For this purpose, we first propose a novel algorithm
named MOD for candidate reduction. Then we introduce an efficient strategy
named MONA, based on MOD, to address TNsCP. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and scalability of MONA compared to several baselines. An
open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/Yocenly/MONA.

STOchastic Recursive Momentum (NSTORM), attaining the optimal sample complexity
of $O(\kappa^3/\epsilon^3)$ for finding an $\epsilon$-accurate solution.
However, NSTORM requires low learning rates, potentially limiting
applicability. Thus we introduce ADAptive NSTORM (ADA-NSTORM) with adaptive
learning rates, proving it achieves the same sample complexity while

<p class="mathjax">Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been demonstrated to be
efficient in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) from a variety of
experimental perspectives. Some recent studies have also proposed PINN
algorithms for PDEs on surfaces, including spheres. However, theoretical
understanding of the numerical performance of PINNs, especially PINNs on
surfaces or manifolds, is still lacking. In this paper, we establish rigorous
analysis of the physics-informed convolutional neural network (PICNN) for
solving PDEs on the sphere. By using and improving the latest approximation
results of deep convolutional neural networks and spherical harmonic analysis,
we prove an upper bound for the approximation error with respect to the Sobolev
norm. Subsequently, we integrate this with innovative localization complexity
analysis to establish fast convergence rates for PICNN. Our theoretical results
are also confirmed and supplemented by our experiments. In light of these
findings, we explore potential strategies for circumventing the curse of
dimensionality that arises when solving high-dimensional PDEs.

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art rehearsal-free continual learning methods exploit the
peculiarities of Vision Transformers to learn task-specific prompts,
drastically reducing catastrophic forgetting. However, there is a tradeoff
between the number of learned parameters and the performance, making such
models computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to reduce this cost
while maintaining competitive performance. We achieve this by revisiting and
extending a simple transfer learning idea: learning task-specific normalization
layers. Specifically, we tune the scale and bias parameters of LayerNorm for
each continual learning task, selecting them at inference time based on the
similarity between task-specific keys and the output of the pre-trained model.
To make the classifier robust to incorrect selection of parameters during
inference, we introduce a two-stage training procedure, where we first optimize
the task-specific parameters and then train the classifier with the same
selection procedure of the inference time. Experiments on ImageNet-R and
CIFAR-100 show that our method achieves results that are either superior or on
par with {the state of the art} while being computationally cheaper.

<p class="mathjax">Language-guided human motion synthesis has been a challenging task due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of human behaviors. Previous methods face
limitations in generalization to novel actions, often resulting in unrealistic
or incoherent motion sequences. In this paper, we propose ATOM (ATomic mOtion
Modeling) to mitigate this problem, by decomposing actions into atomic actions,
and employing a curriculum learning strategy to learn atomic action
composition. First, we disentangle complex human motions into a set of atomic
actions during learning, and then assemble novel actions using the learned
atomic actions, which offers better adaptability to new actions. Moreover, we
introduce a curriculum learning training strategy that leverages masked motion
modeling with a gradual increase in the mask ratio, and thus facilitates atomic
action assembly. This approach mitigates the overfitting problem commonly
encountered in previous methods while enforcing the model to learn better
motion representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ATOM through
extensive experiments, including text-to-motion and action-to-motion synthesis
tasks. We further illustrate its superiority in synthesizing plausible and
coherent text-guided human motion sequences.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel constrained Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm
optimizing the design process of Laterally-Diffused Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
(LDMOS) transistors while realizing a target Breakdown Voltage (BV). We convert
the constrained BO problem into a conventional BO problem using a Lagrange
multiplier. Instead of directly optimizing the traditional Figure-of-Merit
(FOM), we set the Lagrangian as the objective function of BO. This adaptive
objective function with a changeable Lagrange multiplier can address
constrained BO problems which have constraints that require costly evaluations,
without the need for additional surrogate models to approximate constraints.
Our algorithm enables a device designer to set the target BV in the design
space, and obtain a device that satisfies the optimized FOM and the target BV
constraint automatically. Utilizing this algorithm, we have also explored the
physical limits of the FOM for our devices in 30 - 50 V range within the
defined design space.

<p class="mathjax">Due to its computational complexity, graph cuts for cluster detection and
identification are used mostly in the form of convex relaxations. We propose to
utilize the original graph cuts such as Ratio, Normalized or Cheeger Cut in
order to detect clusters in weighted undirected graphs by restricting the graph
cut minimization to the subset of $st$-MinCut partitions. Incorporating a
vertex selection technique and restricting optimization to tightly connected
clusters, we therefore combine the efficient computability of $st$-MinCuts and
the intrinsic properties of Gomory-Hu trees with the cut quality of the
original graph cuts, leading to linear runtime in the number of vertices and
quadratic in the number of edges. Already in simple scenarios, the resulting
algorithm Xist is able to approximate graph cut values better empirically than
spectral clustering or comparable algorithms, even for large network datasets.
We showcase its applicability by segmenting images from cell biology and
provide empirical studies of runtime and classification rate.

<p class="mathjax">Recently 3D object detection from surround-view images has made notable
advancements with its low deployment cost. However, most works have primarily
focused on close perception range while leaving long-range detection less
explored. Expanding existing methods directly to cover long distances poses
challenges such as heavy computation costs and unstable convergence. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel sparse query-based framework,
dubbed Far3D. By utilizing high-quality 2D object priors, we generate 3D
adaptive queries that complement the 3D global queries. To efficiently capture
discriminative features across different views and scales for long-range
objects, we introduce a perspective-aware aggregation module. Additionally, we
propose a range-modulated 3D denoising approach to address query error
propagation and mitigate convergence issues in long-range tasks. Significantly,
Far3D demonstrates SoTA performance on the challenging Argoverse 2 dataset,
covering a wide range of 150 meters, surpassing several LiDAR-based approaches.
Meanwhile, Far3D exhibits superior performance compared to previous methods on
the nuScenes dataset. The code will be available soon.

<p class="mathjax">The progress in maritime obstacle detection is hindered by the lack of a
diverse dataset that adequately captures the complexity of general maritime
environments. We present the first maritime panoptic obstacle detection
benchmark LaRS, featuring scenes from Lakes, Rivers and Seas. Our major
contribution is the new dataset, which boasts the largest diversity in
recording locations, scene types, obstacle classes, and acquisition conditions
among the related datasets. LaRS is composed of over 4000 per-pixel labeled key
frames with nine preceding frames to allow utilization of the temporal texture,
amounting to over 40k frames. Each key frame is annotated with 8 thing, 3 stuff
classes and 19 global scene attributes. We report the results of 27 semantic
and panoptic segmentation methods, along with several performance insights and
future research directions. To enable objective evaluation, we have implemented
an online evaluation server. The LaRS dataset, evaluation toolkit and benchmark
are publicly available at: https://lojzezust.github.io/lars-dataset

<p class="mathjax">Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate
spoken language sentences from sign language videos, both of which have
different grammar and word/gloss order. From a Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
perspective, the straightforward way of training translation models is to use
sign language phrase-spoken language sentence pairs. However, human
interpreters heavily rely on the context to understand the conveyed
information, especially for sign language interpretation, where the vocabulary
size may be significantly smaller than their spoken language equivalent.
<br />Taking direct inspiration from how humans translate, we propose a novel
multi-modal transformer architecture that tackles the translation task in a
context-aware manner, as a human would. We use the context from previous
sequences and confident predictions to disambiguate weaker visual cues. To
achieve this we use complementary transformer encoders, namely: (1) A Video
Encoder, that captures the low-level video features at the frame-level, (2) A
Spotting Encoder, that models the recognized sign glosses in the video, and (3)
A Context Encoder, which captures the context of the preceding sign sequences.
We combine the information coming from these encoders in a final transformer
decoder to generate spoken language translations.
<br />We evaluate our approach on the recently published large-scale BOBSL dataset,
which contains ~1.2M sequences, and on the SRF dataset, which was part of the
WMT-SLT 2022 challenge. We report significant improvements on state-of-the-art
translation performance using contextual information, nearly doubling the
reported BLEU-4 scores of baseline approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) estimates the location of a ground image
by matching it to a geo-tagged aerial image in a database. Recent works achieve
outstanding progress on CVGL benchmarks. However, existing methods still suffer
from poor performance in cross-area evaluation, in which the training and
testing data are captured from completely distinct areas. We attribute this
deficiency to the lack of ability to extract the geometric layout of visual
features and models' overfitting to low-level details. Our preliminary work
introduced a Geometric Layout Extractor (GLE) to capture the geometric layout
from input features. However, the previous GLE does not fully exploit
information in the input feature. In this work, we propose GeoDTR+ with an
enhanced GLE module that better models the correlations among visual features.
To fully explore the LS techniques from our preliminary work, we further
propose Contrastive Hard Samples Generation (CHSG) to facilitate model
training. Extensive experiments show that GeoDTR+ achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in cross-area evaluation on CVUSA, CVACT, and VIGOR by a large
margin ($16.44\%$, $22.71\%$, and $17.02\%$ without polar transformation) while
keeping the same-area performance comparable to existing SOTA. Moreover, we
provide detailed analyses of GeoDTR+.

<p class="mathjax">We study two-player multi-weighted reachability games played on a finite
directed graph, where an agent, called P1, has several quantitative
reachability objectives that he wants to optimize against an antagonistic
environment, called P2. In this setting, we ask what cost profiles P1 can
ensure regardless of the opponent's behavior. Cost profiles are compared thanks
to: (i) a lexicographic order that ensures the unicity of an upper value and
(ii) a componentwise order for which we consider the Pareto frontier. We
synthesize (i) lexico-optimal strategies and (ii) Pareto-optimal strategies.
The strategies are obtained thanks to a fixpoint algorithm which also computes
the upper value in polynomial time and the Pareto frontier in exponential time.
Finally, the constrained existence problem is proved in P for the lexicographic
order and PSPACE-complete for the componentwise order.

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques have become increasingly used in
various fields for decision-making processes. However, a challenge that often
arises is the trade-off between both the computational efficiency of the
decision-making process and the ability of the learned agent to solve a
particular task. This is particularly critical in real-time settings such as
video games where the agent needs to take relevant decisions at a very high
frequency, with a very limited inference time.
<br />In this work, we propose a generic offline learning approach where the
computation cost of the input features is taken into account. We derive the
Budgeted Decision Transformer as an extension of the Decision Transformer that
incorporates cost constraints to limit its cost at inference. As a result, the
model can dynamically choose the best input features at each timestep. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several tasks, including D4RL
benchmarks and complex 3D environments similar to those found in video games,
and show that it can achieve similar performance while using significantly
fewer computational resources compared to classical approaches.

goal to contribute to the understanding of domain-specific factors that
influence perception performance of DNNs (deep neural networks). This work was
carried out under the German research project KI Absicherung in order to
develop a methodology for the validation of DNNs in the context of pedestrian
detection in urban environments for automated driving. The VALERIE22 dataset
was generated with the VALERIE procedural tools pipeline providing a
photorealistic sensor simulation rendered from automatically synthesized
scenes. The dataset provides a uniquely rich set of metadata, allowing
extraction of specific scene and semantic features (like pixel-accurate
occlusion rates, positions in the scene and distance + angle to the camera).
This enables a multitude of possible tests on the data and we hope to stimulate
research on understanding performance of DNNs. Based on performance metric a
comparison with several other publicly available datasets is provided,
demonstrating that VALERIE22 is one of best performing synthetic datasets
currently available in the open domain.

<p class="mathjax">Parallel robots provide the potential to be leveraged for human-robot
collaboration (HRC) due to low collision energies even at high speeds resulting
from their reduced moving masses. However, the risk of unintended contact with
the leg chains increases compared to the structure of serial robots. As a first
step towards HRC, contact cases on the whole parallel robot structure are
investigated and a disturbance observer based on generalized momenta and
measurements of motor current is applied. In addition, a Kalman filter and a
second-order sliding-mode observer based on generalized momenta are compared in
terms of error and detection time. Gearless direct drives with low friction
improve external force estimation and enable low impedance. The experimental
validation is performed with two force-torque sensors and a kinetostatic model.
This allows a new identification method of the motor torque constant of an
assembled parallel robot to estimate external forces from the motor current and
via a dynamics model. A Cartesian impedance control scheme for compliant
robot-environmental dynamics with stiffness from 0.1-2N/mm and the force
observation for low forces over the entire structure are validated. The
observers are used for collisions and clamping at velocities of 0.4-0.9m/s for
detection within 9-58ms and a reaction in the form of a zero-g mode.

<p class="mathjax">Time series data are observations collected over time intervals. Successful
analysis of time series data captures patterns such as trends, cyclicity and
irregularity, which are crucial for decision making in research, business, and
governance. However, missing values in time series data occur often and present
obstacles to successful analysis, thus they need to be filled with alternative
values, a process called imputation. Although various approaches have been
attempted for robust imputation of time series data, even the most advanced
methods still face challenges including limited scalability, poor capacity to
handle heterogeneous data types and inflexibility due to requiring strong
assumptions of data missing mechanisms. Moreover, the imputation accuracy of
these methods still has room for improvement. In this study, I developed
tsDataWig (time-series DataWig) by modifying DataWig, a neural network-based
method that possesses the capacity to process large datasets and heterogeneous
data types but was designed for non-time series data imputation. Unlike the
original DataWig, tsDataWig can directly handle values of time variables and
impute missing values in complex time series datasets. Using one simulated and
three different complex real-world time series datasets, I demonstrated that
tsDataWig outperforms the original DataWig and the current state-of-the-art
methods for time series data imputation and potentially has broad application
due to not requiring strong assumptions of data missing mechanisms. This study
provides a valuable solution for robustly imputing missing values in
challenging time series datasets, which often contain millions of samples, high
dimensional variables, and heterogeneous data types.

<p class="mathjax">For peer production communities to be sustainable, they must attract and
retain new contributors. Studies have identified social and technical barriers
to entry and discovered some potential solutions, but these solutions have
typically focused on a single highly successful community, the English
Wikipedia, been tested in isolation, and rarely evaluated through controlled
experiments. We propose the Newcomer Homepage, a central place where newcomers
can learn how peer production works and find opportunities to contribute, as a
solution for attracting and retaining newcomers. The homepage was built upon
existing research and designed in collaboration with partner communities.
Through a large-scale controlled experiment spanning 27 non-English Wikipedia
wikis, we evaluate the homepage and find modest gains, and that having a
positive effect on the newcomer experience depends on the newcomer's context.
We discuss how this impacts interventions that aim to improve the newcomer
experience in peer production communities.

<p class="mathjax">The democratization of Data Mining has been widely successful thanks in part
to powerful and easy-to-use Machine Learning libraries. These libraries have
been particularly tailored to tackle Supervised Learning. However, strong
supervision signals are scarce in practice, and practitioners must resort to
weak supervision. In addition to weaknesses of supervision, dataset shifts are
another kind of phenomenon that occurs when deploying machine learning models
in the real world. That is why Biquality Learning has been proposed as a
machine learning framework to design algorithms capable of handling multiple
weaknesses of supervision and dataset shifts without assumptions on their
nature and level by relying on the availability of a small trusted dataset
composed of cleanly labeled and representative samples. Thus we propose
biquality-learn: a Python library for Biquality Learning with an intuitive and
consistent API to learn machine learning models from biquality data, with
well-proven algorithms, accessible and easy to use for everyone, and enabling
researchers to experiment in a reproducible way on biquality data.

<p class="mathjax">Numerous approaches have been explored for graph clustering, including those
which optimize a global criteria such as modularity. More recently, Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), which have produced state-of-the-art results in graph
analysis tasks such as node classification and link prediction, have been
applied for unsupervised graph clustering using these modularity-based metrics.
Modularity, though robust for many practical applications, suffers from the
resolution limit problem, in which optimization may fail to identify clusters
smaller than a scale that is dependent on properties of the network. In this
paper, we propose a new GNN framework which draws from the Potts model in
physics to overcome this limitation. Experiments on a variety of real world
datasets show that this model achieves state-of-the-art clustering results.

<p class="mathjax">Deploying deep learning models in safety-critical applications remains a very
challenging task, mandating the provision of assurances for the dependable
operation of these models. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods estimate the
model's confidence per prediction, informing decision-making by considering the
effect of randomness and model misspecification. Despite the advances of
state-of-the-art UQ methods, they are computationally expensive or produce
conservative prediction sets/intervals. We introduce MC-CP, a novel hybrid UQ
method that combines a new adaptive Monte Carlo (MC) dropout method with
conformal prediction (CP). MC-CP adaptively modulates the traditional MC
dropout at runtime to save memory and computation resources, enabling
predictions to be consumed by CP, yielding robust prediction sets/intervals.
Throughout comprehensive experiments, we show that MC-CP delivers significant
improvements over advanced UQ methods, like MC dropout, RAPS and CQR, both in
classification and regression benchmarks. MC-CP can be easily added to existing
models, making its deployment simple.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems have become indispensable in music streaming services,
enhancing user experiences by personalizing playlists and facilitating the
serendipitous discovery of new music. However, the existing recommender systems
overlook the unique challenges inherent in the music domain, specifically
shuffle play, which provides subsequent tracks in a random sequence. Based on
our observation that the shuffle play sessions hinder the overall training
process of music recommender systems mainly due to the high unique transition
rates of shuffle play sessions, we propose a Music Recommender System with
Shuffle Play Recommendation Enhancement (MUSE). MUSE employs the
self-supervised learning framework that maximizes the agreement between the
original session and the augmented session, which is augmented by our novel
session augmentation method, called transition-based augmentation. To further
facilitate the alignment of the representations between the two views, we
devise two fine-grained matching strategies, i.e., item- and similarity-based
matching strategies. Through rigorous experiments conducted across diverse
environments, we demonstrate MUSE's efficacy over 12 baseline models on a
large-scale Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD) from Spotify. The source
code of MUSE is available at \url{https://github.com/yunhak0/MUSE}.

<p class="mathjax">Parallel robots (PRs) allow for higher speeds in human-robot collaboration
due to their lower moving masses but are more prone to unintended contact. For
a safe reaction, knowledge of the location and force of a collision is useful.
A novel algorithm for collision isolation and identification with
proprioceptive information for a real PR is the scope of this work. To classify
the collided body, the effects of contact forces at the links and platform of
the PR are analyzed using a kinetostatic projection. This insight enables the
derivation of features from the line of action of the estimated external force.
The significance of these features is confirmed in experiments for various load
cases. A feedforward neural network (FNN) classifies the collided body based on
these physically modeled features. Generalization with the FNN to 300k load
cases on the whole robot structure in other joint angle configurations is
successfully performed with a collision-body classification accuracy of 84% in
the experiments. Platform collisions are isolated and identified with an
explicit solution, while a particle filter estimates the location and force of
a contact on a kinematic chain. Updating the particle filter with estimated
external joint torques leads to an isolation error of less than 3cm and an
identification error of 4N in a real-world experiment.

<p class="mathjax">Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for safe human-robot collaboration
because of their low moving masses. Due to the in-parallel kinematic chains,
the risk of contact in the form of collisions and clamping at a chain
increases. Ensuring safety is investigated in this work through various contact
reactions on a real planar PR. External forces are estimated based on
proprioceptive information and a dynamics model, which allows contact
detection. Retraction along the direction of the estimated line of action
provides an instantaneous response to limit the occurring contact forces within
the experiment to 70N at a maximum velocity 0.4m/s. A reduction in the
stiffness of a Cartesian impedance control is investigated as a further
strategy. For clamping, a feedforward neural network (FNN) is trained and
tested in different joint angle configurations to classify whether a collision
or clamping occurs with an accuracy of 80%. A second FNN classifies the
clamping kinematic chain to enable a subsequent kinematic projection of the
clamping joint angle onto the rotational platform coordinates. In this way, a
structure opening is performed in addition to the softer retraction movement.
The reaction strategies are compared in real-world experiments at different
velocities and controller stiffnesses to demonstrate their effectiveness. The
results show that in all collision and clamping experiments the PR terminates
the contact in less than 130ms.

<p class="mathjax">There emerges a promising trend of using large language models (LLMs) to
generate code-like plans for complex inference tasks such as visual reasoning.
This paradigm, known as LLM-based planning, provides flexibility in problem
solving and endows better interpretability. However, current research is mostly
limited to basic scenarios of simple questions that can be straightforward
answered in a few inference steps. Planning for the more challenging multi-hop
visual reasoning tasks remains under-explored. Specifically, under multi-hop
reasoning situations, the trade-off between accuracy and the complexity of
plan-searching becomes prominent. The prevailing algorithms either address the
efficiency issue by employing the fast one-stop generation or adopt a complex
iterative generation method to improve accuracy. Both fail to balance the need
for efficiency and performance. Drawing inspiration from the dual system of
cognition in the human brain, the fast and the slow think processes, we propose
a hierarchical plan-searching algorithm that integrates the one-stop reasoning
(fast) and the Tree-of-thought (slow). Our approach succeeds in performance
while significantly saving inference steps. Moreover, we repurpose the PTR and
the CLEVER datasets, developing a systematic framework for evaluating the
performance and efficiency of LLMs-based plan-search algorithms under reasoning
tasks at different levels of difficulty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of performance and efficiency.
The dataset and code will be release soon.

<p class="mathjax">Instead of repeatedly re-analyzing from scratch, an incremental static
analysis only analyzes a codebase once completely, and then it updates the
previous results based on the code changes. While this sounds promising to
achieve speed-ups, the reality is that sophisticated static analyses typically
employ features that can ruin incremental performance, such as
inter-procedurality or context-sensitivity. In this study, we set out to
explore whether incrementalization can help to achieve speed-ups for production
CodeQL analyses that provide automated feedback on pull requests on GitHub. We
first empirically validate the idea by measuring the potential for reuse on
real-world codebases, and then we create a prototype incremental solver for
CodeQL that exploits incrementality. We report on experimental results showing
that we can indeed achieve update times proportional to the size of the code
change, and we also discuss the limitations of our prototype.

<p class="mathjax">Larger language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm with their
massive multi-tasking capabilities simply by optimizing over a next-word
prediction objective. With the emergence of their properties and encoded
knowledge, the risk of LLMs producing harmful outputs increases, making them
unfit for scalable deployment for the public. In this work, we propose a new
safety evaluation benchmark RED-EVAL that carries out red-teaming. We show that
even widely deployed models are susceptible to the Chain of Utterances-based
(CoU) prompting, jailbreaking closed source LLM-based systems such as GPT-4 and
ChatGPT to unethically respond to more than 65% and 73% of harmful queries. We
also demonstrate the consistency of the RED-EVAL across 8 open-source LLMs in
generating harmful responses in more than 86% of the red-teaming attempts.
Next, we propose RED-INSTRUCT--An approach for the safety alignment of LLMs. It
constitutes two phases: 1) HARMFULQA data collection: Leveraging CoU prompting,
we collect a dataset that consists of 1.9K harmful questions covering a wide
range of topics, 9.5K safe and 7.3K harmful conversations from ChatGPT; 2)
SAFE-ALIGN: We demonstrate how the conversational dataset can be used for the
safety alignment of LLMs by minimizing the negative log-likelihood over helpful
responses and penalizing over harmful responses by gradient accent over sample
loss. Our model STARLING, a fine-tuned Vicuna-7B, is observed to be more safely
aligned when evaluated on RED-EVAL and HHH benchmarks while preserving the
utility of the baseline models (TruthfulQA, MMLU, and BBH).

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning with masked autoencoders has recently gained
popularity for its ability to produce effective image or textual
representations, which can be applied to various downstream tasks without
retraining. However, we observe that the current masked autoencoder models lack
good generalization ability on graph data. To tackle this issue, we propose a
novel graph masked autoencoder framework called GiGaMAE. Different from
existing masked autoencoders that learn node presentations by explicitly
reconstructing the original graph components (e.g., features or edges), in this
paper, we propose to collaboratively reconstruct informative and integrated
latent embeddings. By considering embeddings encompassing graph topology and
attribute information as reconstruction targets, our model could capture more
generalized and comprehensive knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a mutual
information based reconstruction loss that enables the effective reconstruction
of multiple targets. This learning objective allows us to differentiate between
the exclusive knowledge learned from a single target and common knowledge
shared by multiple targets. We evaluate our method on three downstream tasks
with seven datasets as benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of GiGaMAE against state-of-the-art baselines. We hope our results
will shed light on the design of foundation models on graph-structured data.

factor ${\sf Gap}_{\ell,\mu}(\psi)/\log(1/\mu)^2$ (ignoring factors depending
on $r$) for any $\ell \geq \ell(\mu,r)$. Here, ${\sf Gap}_{\ell,\mu}(\psi)$ is
the optimal integrality gap of $\ell$-round Lasserre relaxation for
$\mu$-constrained Max-CSP($\psi$) instances.
<br />Our results are derived by combining the framework of Raghavendra [STOC 2008]
along with more recent advances in rounding Lasserre relaxations and reductions
from the Small-Set Expansion (SSE) problem. A crucial component of our
reduction is a novel way of composing generic bias-dependent dictatorship tests
with SSE, which could be of independent interest.

<p class="mathjax">A $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $X$ is said to support a direct product
tester if any locally consistent function defined on its $k$-faces (where $k\ll
d$) necessarily come from a function over its vertices. More precisely, a
direct product tester has a distribution $\mu$ over pairs of $k$-faces
$(A,A')$, and given query access to $F\colon X(k)\to\{0,1\}^k$ it samples
$(A,A')\sim \mu$ and checks that $F[A]|_{A\cap A'} = F[A']|_{A\cap A'}$. The
tester should have (1) the "completeness property", meaning that any assignment
$F$ which is a direct product assignment passes the test with probability $1$,
and (2) the "soundness property", meaning that if $F$ passes the test with
probability $s$, then $F$ must be correlated with a direct product function.
<br />Dinur and Kaufman showed that a sufficiently good spectral expanding complex
$X$ admits a direct product tester in the "high soundness" regime where $s$ is
close to $1$. They asked whether there are high dimensional expanders that
support direct product tests in the "low soundness", when $s$ is close to $0$.
<br />We give a characterization of high-dimensional expanders that support a
direct product tester in the low soundness regime. We show that spectral
expansion is insufficient, and the complex must additionally satisfy a variant
of coboundary expansion, which we refer to as Unique-Games coboundary
expanders. This property can be seen as a high-dimensional generalization of
the standard notion of coboundary expansion over non-Abelian groups for
2-dimensional complexes. It asserts that any locally consistent Unique-Games
instance obtained using the low-level faces of the complex, must admit a good
global solution.

<p class="mathjax">Language models are useful adjuncts to optical models for producing accurate
optical character recognition (OCR) results. One factor which limits the power
of language models in this context is the existence of many specialized domains
with language statistics very different from those implied by a general
language model - think of checks, medical prescriptions, and many other
specialized document classes. This paper introduces an algorithm for
efficiently generating and attaching a domain specific word based language
model at run time to a general language model in an OCR system. In order to
best use this model the paper also introduces a modified CTC beam search
decoder which effectively allows hypotheses to remain in contention based on
possible future completion of vocabulary words. The result is a substantial
reduction in word error rate in recognizing material from specialized domains.

<p class="mathjax">In human-robot collaboration, unintentional physical contacts occur in the
form of collisions and clamping, which must be detected and classified
separately for a reaction. If certain collision or clamping situations are
misclassified, reactions might occur that make the true contact case more
dangerous. This work analyzes data-driven modeling based on physically modeled
features like estimated external forces for clamping and collision
classification with a real parallel robot. The prediction reliability of a
feedforward neural network is investigated. Quantification of the
classification uncertainty enables the distinction between safe versus
unreliable classifications and optimal reactions like a retraction movement for
collisions, structure opening for the clamping joint, and a fallback reaction
in the form of a zero-g mode. This hypothesis is tested with experimental data
of clamping and collision cases by analyzing dangerous misclassifications and
then reducing them by the proposed uncertainty quantification. Finally, it is
investigated how the approach of this work influences correctly classified
clamping and collision scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">The current 3D human pose estimators face challenges in adapting to new
datasets due to the scarcity of 2D-3D pose pairs in target domain training
sets. We present the \textit{Multi-Hypothesis \textbf{P}ose \textbf{Syn}thesis
\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation} (\textbf{PoSynDA}) framework to overcome
this issue without extensive target domain annotation. Utilizing a
diffusion-centric structure, PoSynDA simulates the 3D pose distribution in the
target domain, filling the data diversity gap. By incorporating a
multi-hypothesis network, it creates diverse pose hypotheses and aligns them
with the target domain. Target-specific source augmentation obtains the target
domain distribution data from the source domain by decoupling the scale and
position parameters. The teacher-student paradigm and low-rank adaptation
further refine the process. PoSynDA demonstrates competitive performance on
benchmarks, such as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, even comparable with the
target-trained MixSTE model~\cite{zhang2022mixste}. This work paves the way for
the practical application of 3D human pose estimation. The code is available at
https://github.com/hbing-l/PoSynDA.

<p class="mathjax">We present Audiovisual Moments in Time (AVMIT), a large-scale dataset of
audiovisual action events. In an extensive annotation task 11 participants
labelled a subset of 3-second audiovisual videos from the Moments in Time
dataset (MIT). For each trial, participants assessed whether the labelled
audiovisual action event was present and whether it was the most prominent
feature of the video. The dataset includes the annotation of 57,177 audiovisual
videos, each independently evaluated by 3 of 11 trained participants. From this
initial collection, we created a curated test set of 16 distinct action
classes, with 60 videos each (960 videos). We also offer 2 sets of pre-computed
audiovisual feature embeddings, using VGGish/YamNet for audio data and
VGG16/EfficientNetB0 for visual data, thereby lowering the barrier to entry for
audiovisual DNN research. We explored the advantages of AVMIT annotations and
feature embeddings to improve performance on audiovisual event recognition. A
series of 6 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were trained on either
AVMIT-filtered audiovisual events or modality-agnostic events from MIT, and
then tested on our audiovisual test set. In all RNNs, top 1 accuracy was
increased by 2.71-5.94\% by training exclusively on audiovisual events, even
outweighing a three-fold increase in training data. We anticipate that the
newly annotated AVMIT dataset will serve as a valuable resource for research
and comparative experiments involving computational models and human
participants, specifically when addressing research questions where audiovisual
correspondence is of critical importance.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms
such as Chain-ofThought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary
advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as
an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices,
and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach
enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling
the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback
loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on
different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT,
while simultaneously reducing costs by &gt;31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible
with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new
prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking
or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.

<p class="mathjax">Three dimensional electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) microscopy is a
critical tool in many applications in materials science, yet its data quality
can fluctuate greatly during the arduous collection process, particularly via
serial-sectioning. Fortunately, 3D EBSD data is inherently sequential, opening
up the opportunity to use transformers, state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures that have made breakthroughs in a plethora of domains, for data
processing and recovery. To be more robust to errors and accelerate this 3D
EBSD data collection, we introduce a two step method that recovers missing
slices in an 3D EBSD volume, using an efficient transformer model and a
projection algorithm to process the transformer's outputs. Overcoming the
computational and practical hurdles of deep learning with scarce high
dimensional data, we train this model using only synthetic 3D EBSD data with
self-supervision and obtain superior recovery accuracy on real 3D EBSD data,
compared to existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">We tackle the data scarcity challenge in few-shot point cloud recognition of
3D objects by using a joint prediction from a conventional 3D model and a
well-trained 2D model. Surprisingly, such an ensemble, though seems trivial,
has hardly been shown effective in recent 2D-3D models. We find out the crux is
the less effective training for the ''joint hard samples'', which have high
confidence prediction on different wrong labels, implying that the 2D and 3D
models do not collaborate well. To this end, our proposed invariant training
strategy, called InvJoint, does not only emphasize the training more on the
hard samples, but also seeks the invariance between the conflicting 2D and 3D
ambiguous predictions. InvJoint can learn more collaborative 2D and 3D
representations for better ensemble. Extensive experiments on 3D shape
classification with widely adopted ModelNet10/40, ScanObjectNN and Toys4K, and
shape retrieval with ShapeNet-Core validate the superiority of our InvJoint.

<p class="mathjax">We present the first polynomial-time algorithm to exactly compute the number
of labeled chordal graphs on n vertices. Our algorithm solves a more general
problem: given n and omega as input, it computes the number of omega-colorable
labeled chordal graphs on n vertices, using O(n^7) arithmetic operations. A
standard sampling-to-counting reduction then yields a polynomial-time exact
sampler that generates an omega-colorable labeled chordal graph on n vertices
uniformly at random. Our counting algorithm improves upon the previous best
result by Wormald (1985), which computes the number of labeled chordal graphs
on n vertices in time exponential in n.
<br />An implementation of the polynomial-time counting algorithm gives the number
of labeled chordal graphs on up to 30 vertices in less than three minutes on a
standard desktop computer. Previously, the number of labeled chordal graphs was
only known for graphs on up to 15 vertices.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, text-to-image generation has exhibited remarkable advancements,
with the ability to produce visually impressive results. In contrast,
text-to-3D generation has not yet reached a comparable level of quality.
Existing methods primarily rely on text-guided score distillation sampling
(SDS), and they encounter difficulties in transferring 2D attributes of the
generated images to 3D content. In this work, we aim to develop an effective 3D
generative model capable of synthesizing high-resolution textured meshes by
leveraging both textual and image information. To this end, we introduce
Guide3D, a zero-shot text-and-image-guided generative model for 3D avatar
generation based on diffusion models. Our model involves (1) generating
sparse-view images of a text-consistent character using diffusion models, and
(2) jointly optimizing multi-resolution differentiable marching tetrahedral
grids with pixel-aligned image features. We further propose a similarity-aware
feature fusion strategy for efficiently integrating features from different
views. Moreover, we introduce two novel training objectives as an alternative
to calculating SDS, significantly enhancing the optimization process. We
thoroughly evaluate the performance and components of our framework, which
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in producing topologically and
structurally correct geometry and high-resolution textures. Guide3D enables the
direct transfer of 2D-generated images to the 3D space. Our code will be made
publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Automating the checkout process is important in smart retail, where users
effortlessly pass products by hand through a camera, triggering automatic
product detection, tracking, and counting. In this emerging area, due to the
lack of annotated training data, we introduce a dataset comprised of product 3D
models, which allows for fast, flexible, and large-scale training data
generation through graphic engine rendering. Within this context, we discern an
intriguing facet, because of the user "hands-on" approach, bias in user
behavior leads to distinct patterns in the real checkout process. The existence
of such patterns would compromise training effectiveness if training data fail
to reflect the same. To address this user bias problem, we propose a training
data optimization framework, i.e., training with digital twins (DtTrain).
Specifically, we leverage the product 3D models and optimize their rendering
viewpoint and illumination to generate "digital twins" that visually resemble
representative user images. These digital twins, inherit product labels and,
when augmented, form the Digital Twin training set (DT set). Because the
digital twins individually mimic user bias, the resulting DT training set
better reflects the characteristics of the target scenario and allows us to
train more effective product detection and tracking models. In our experiment,
we show that DT set outperforms training sets created by existing dataset
synthesis methods in terms of counting accuracy. Moreover, by combining DT set
with pseudo-labeled real checkout data, further improvement is observed. The
code is available at https://github.com/yorkeyao/Automated-Retail-Checkout.

<p class="mathjax">The recent wave of AI-generated content has witnessed the great development
and success of Text-to-Image (T2I) technologies. By contrast, Text-to-Video
(T2V) still falls short of expectations though attracting increasing interests.
Existing works either train from scratch or adapt large T2I model to videos,
both of which are computation and resource expensive. In this work, we propose
a Simple Diffusion Adapter (SimDA) that fine-tunes only 24M out of 1.1B
parameters of a strong T2I model, adapting it to video generation in a
parameter-efficient way. In particular, we turn the T2I model for T2V by
designing light-weight spatial and temporal adapters for transfer learning.
Besides, we change the original spatial attention to the proposed Latent-Shift
Attention (LSA) for temporal consistency. With similar model architecture, we
further train a video super-resolution model to generate high-definition
(1024x1024) videos. In addition to T2V generation in the wild, SimDA could also
be utilized in one-shot video editing with only 2 minutes tuning. Doing so, our
method could minimize the training effort with extremely few tunable parameters
for model adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">While state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation approaches achieve
impressive results in ideal settings, they are highly unreliable under
challenging illumination and weather conditions, such as at nighttime or in the
presence of rain. In this paper, we uncover these safety-critical issues and
tackle them with md4all: a simple and effective solution that works reliably
under both adverse and ideal conditions, as well as for different types of
learning supervision. We achieve this by exploiting the efficacy of existing
methods under perfect settings. Therefore, we provide valid training signals
independently of what is in the input. First, we generate a set of complex
samples corresponding to the normal training ones. Then, we train the model by
guiding its self- or full-supervision by feeding the generated samples and
computing the standard losses on the corresponding original images. Doing so
enables a single model to recover information across diverse conditions without
modifications at inference time. Extensive experiments on two challenging
public datasets, namely nuScenes and Oxford RobotCar, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our techniques, outperforming prior works by a large margin in
both standard and challenging conditions. Source code and data are available

<p class="mathjax">3D human generation from 2D images has achieved remarkable progress through
the synergistic utilization of neural rendering and generative models. Existing
3D human generative models mainly generate a clothed 3D human as an
undetectable 3D model in a single pass, while rarely considering the layer-wise
nature of a clothed human body, which often consists of the human body and
various clothes such as underwear, outerwear, trousers, shoes, etc. In this
work, we propose HumanLiff, the first layer-wise 3D human generative model with
a unified diffusion process. Specifically, HumanLiff firstly generates
minimal-clothed humans, represented by tri-plane features, in a canonical
space, and then progressively generates clothes in a layer-wise manner. In this
way, the 3D human generation is thus formulated as a sequence of
diffusion-based 3D conditional generation. To reconstruct more fine-grained 3D
humans with tri-plane representation, we propose a tri-plane shift operation
that splits each tri-plane into three sub-planes and shifts these sub-planes to
enable feature grid subdivision. To further enhance the controllability of 3D
generation with 3D layered conditions, HumanLiff hierarchically fuses tri-plane
features and 3D layered conditions to facilitate the 3D diffusion model
learning. Extensive experiments on two layer-wise 3D human datasets, SynBody
(synthetic) and TightCap (real-world), validate that HumanLiff significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in layer-wise 3D human generation. Our
code will be available at https://skhu101.github.io/HumanLiff.

<p class="mathjax">We present a method that simultaneously addresses the tasks of dynamic scene
novel-view synthesis and six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) tracking of all dense
scene elements. We follow an analysis-by-synthesis framework, inspired by
recent work that models scenes as a collection of 3D Gaussians which are
optimized to reconstruct input images via differentiable rendering. To model
dynamic scenes, we allow Gaussians to move and rotate over time while enforcing
that they have persistent color, opacity, and size. By regularizing Gaussians'
motion and rotation with local-rigidity constraints, we show that our Dynamic
3D Gaussians correctly model the same area of physical space over time,
including the rotation of that space. Dense 6-DOF tracking and dynamic
reconstruction emerges naturally from persistent dynamic view synthesis,
without requiring any correspondence or flow as input. We demonstrate a large
number of downstream applications enabled by our representation, including
first-person view synthesis, dynamic compositional scene synthesis, and 4D
video editing.

<p class="mathjax">The task of lip synchronization (lip-sync) seeks to match the lips of human
faces with different audio. It has various applications in the film industry as
well as for creating virtual avatars and for video conferencing. This is a
challenging problem as one needs to simultaneously introduce detailed,
realistic lip movements while preserving the identity, pose, emotions, and
image quality. Many of the previous methods trying to solve this problem suffer
from image quality degradation due to a lack of complete contextual
information. In this paper, we present Diff2Lip, an audio-conditioned
diffusion-based model which is able to do lip synchronization in-the-wild while
preserving these qualities. We train our model on Voxceleb2, a video dataset
containing in-the-wild talking face videos. Extensive studies show that our
method outperforms popular methods like Wav2Lip and PC-AVS in Fr\'echet
inception distance (FID) metric and Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) of the users. We
show results on both reconstruction (same audio-video inputs) as well as cross
(different audio-video inputs) settings on Voxceleb2 and LRW datasets. Video
results and code can be accessed from our project page (
https://soumik-kanad.github.io/diff2lip ).

<p class="mathjax">The task of few-shot GAN adaptation aims to adapt a pre-trained GAN model to
a small dataset with very few training images. While existing methods perform
well when the dataset for pre-training is structurally similar to the target
dataset, the approaches suffer from training instabilities or memorization
issues when the objects in the two domains have a very different structure. To
mitigate this limitation, we propose a new smoothness similarity regularization
that transfers the inherently learned smoothness of the pre-trained GAN to the
few-shot target domain even if the two domains are very different. We evaluate
our approach by adapting an unconditional and a class-conditional GAN to
diverse few-shot target domains. Our proposed method significantly outperforms
prior few-shot GAN adaptation methods in the challenging case of structurally
dissimilar source-target domains, while performing on par with the state of the
art for similar source-target domains.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancement of deep learning models often attributes to their
ability to leverage massive training data. In contrast, such privilege has not
yet fully benefited 3D deep learning, mainly due to the limited availability of
large-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting
them collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However, due
to the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets, such mixed supervision
could adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated
performance (i.e., negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In
view of this challenge, we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT), a novel
framework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D
representation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on
this framework, we propose Prompt-driven Normalization, which adapts the model
to different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided
Categorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces
by leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify
that PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic
learning and produce generalizable representations. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on each dataset using a single weight-shared model
with supervised multi-dataset training. Moreover, when served as a pre-training
framework, it outperforms other pre-training approaches regarding
representation quality and attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance
across over ten diverse downstream tasks spanning both indoor and outdoor 3D
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Providing an abstract representation of natural and human complex structures
is a challenging problem. Accounting for the system heterogenous components
while allowing for analytical tractability is a difficult balance. Here I
introduce complex hypergraphs (chygraphs), bringing together concepts from
hypergraphs, multi-layer networks, simplicial complexes and hyperstructures. To
illustrate the applicability of this combinatorial structure I calculate the
component sizes statistics and identify the transition to a giant component. To
this end I introduce a vectorization technique that tackles the multi-level
nature of chygraphs. I conclude that chygraphs are a unifying representation of
complex systems allowing for analytical insight.

lymphocyte nuclear density (LND) on myocardial WSIs. A cutoff value based on
the quantification of LND was proposed to determine if the myocardial
inflammatory infiltration was present. The performance of our approach was
evaluated with a five-fold cross-validation experiment, tested with an internal
test set from the myocarditis group, and confirmed by an external test from a
double-blind trial group. An LND of 1.02/mm2 could distinguish WSIs with
myocarditis from those without. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the five-fold
cross-validation experiment were 0.899 plus or minus 0.035, 0.971 plus or minus
0.017, 0.728 plus or minus 0.073 and 0.849 plus or minus 0.044, respectively.
For the internal test set, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were
0.887, 0.971, 0.737, and 0.854, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, and AUC for the external test set reached 0.853, 0.846, 0.858, and
0.852, respectively. Our new approach provides accurate and reliable
quantification of the LND of myocardial WSIs, facilitating automated
quantitative diagnosis of myocarditis with HE-stained images.

<p class="mathjax">Percolation theory investigates systems of interconnected units, their
resilience to damage and their propensity to propagation. For random networks
we can solve the percolation problems analytically using the generating
function formalism. Yet, with the introduction of higher order networks, the
generating function calculations are becoming difficult to perform and harder
to validate. Here, I illustrate the mapping of percolation in higher order
networks to percolation in chygraphs. Chygraphs are defined as a set of
complexes where complexes are hypergraphs with vertex sets in the set of
complexes. In a previous work I reported the generating function formalism to
percolation in chygraphs and obtained an analytical equation for the order
parameter. Taking advantage of this result, I recapitulate analytical results
for percolation problems in higher order networks and report extensions to more
complex scenarios using symbolic calculations.

<p class="mathjax">Communication compression, a technique aiming to reduce the information
volume to be transmitted over the air, has gained great interests in Federated
Learning (FL) for the potential of alleviating its communication overhead.
However, communication compression brings forth new challenges in FL due to the
interplay of compression-incurred information distortion and inherent
characteristics of FL such as partial participation and data heterogeneity.
Despite the recent development, the performance of compressed FL approaches has
not been fully exploited. The existing approaches either cannot accommodate
arbitrary data heterogeneity or partial participation, or require stringent
conditions on compression.
<br />In this paper, we revisit the seminal stochastic controlled averaging method
by proposing an equivalent but more efficient/simplified formulation with
halved uplink communication costs. Building upon this implementation, we
propose two compressed FL algorithms, SCALLION and SCAFCOM, to support unbiased
and biased compression, respectively. Both the proposed methods outperform the
existing compressed FL methods in terms of communication and computation
complexities. Moreover, SCALLION and SCAFCOM accommodates arbitrary data
heterogeneity and do not make any additional assumptions on compression errors.
Experiments show that SCALLION and SCAFCOM can match the performance of
corresponding full-precision FL approaches with substantially reduced uplink
communication, and outperform recent compressed FL methods under the same
communication budget.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting future prices of a stock is an arduous task to perform. However,
incorporating additional elements can significantly improve our predictions,
rather than relying solely on a stock's historical price data to forecast its
future price. Studies have demonstrated that investor sentiment, which is
impacted by daily news about the company, can have a significant impact on
stock price swings. There are numerous sources from which we can get this
information, but they are cluttered with a lot of noise, making it difficult to
accurately extract the sentiments from them. Hence the focus of our research is
to design an efficient system to capture the sentiments from the news about the
NITY50 stocks and investigate how much the financial news sentiment of these
stocks are affecting their prices over a period of time. This paper presents a
robust data collection and preprocessing framework to create a news database
for a timeline of around 3.7 years, consisting of almost half a million news
articles. We also capture the stock price information for this timeline and
create multiple time series data, that include the sentiment scores from
various sections of the article, calculated using different sentiment
libraries. Based on this, we fit several LSTM models to forecast the stock
prices, with and without using the sentiment scores as features and compare
their performances.

<p class="mathjax">We extend recurrent neural networks to include several flexible timescales
for each dimension of their output, which mechanically improves their abilities
to account for processes with long memory or with highly disparate time scales.
We compare the ability of vanilla and extended long short term memory networks
(LSTMs) to predict asset price volatility, known to have a long memory.
Generally, the number of epochs needed to train extended LSTMs is divided by
two, while the variation of validation and test losses among models with the
same hyperparameters is much smaller. We also show that the model with the
smallest validation loss systemically outperforms rough volatility predictions
by about 20% when trained and tested on a dataset with multiple time series.

<p class="mathjax">Cryptocurrencies have become a popular and widely researched topic of
interest in recent years for investors and scholars. In order to make informed
investment decisions, it is essential to comprehend the factors that impact
cryptocurrency prices and to identify risky cryptocurrencies. This paper
focuses on analyzing historical data and using artificial intelligence
algorithms on on-chain parameters to identify the factors affecting a
cryptocurrency's price and to find risky cryptocurrencies. We conducted an
analysis of historical cryptocurrencies' on-chain data and measured the
correlation between the price and other parameters. In addition, we used
clustering and classification in order to get a better understanding of a
cryptocurrency and classify it as risky or not. The analysis revealed that a
significant proportion of cryptocurrencies (39%) disappeared from the market,
while only a small fraction (10%) survived for more than 1000 days. Our
analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between cryptocurrency
price and maximum and total supply, as well as a weak positive correlation
between price and 24-hour trading volume. Moreover, we clustered
cryptocurrencies into five distinct groups using their on-chain parameters,
which provides investors with a more comprehensive understanding of a
cryptocurrency when compared to those clustered with it. Finally, by
implementing multiple classifiers to predict whether a cryptocurrency is risky
or not, we obtained the best f1-score of 76% using K-Nearest Neighbor.

<p class="mathjax">Financial time series have historically been assumed to be a martingale
process under the Random Walk hypothesis. Instead of making investment
decisions using the raw prices alone, various multimodal pattern matching
algorithms have been developed to help detect subtly hidden repeatable patterns
within the financial market. Many of the chart-based pattern matching tools
only retrieve similar past chart (PC) patterns given the current chart (CC)
pattern, and leaves the entire interpretive and predictive analysis, thus
ultimately the final investment decision, to the investors. In this paper, we
propose an approach of ranking similar PC movements given the CC information
and show that exploiting this as additional features improves the directional
prediction capacity of our model. We apply our ranking and directional
prediction modeling methodologies on Bitcoin due to its highly volatile prices
that make it challenging to predict its future movements.

<p class="mathjax">The Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) phase of drug development is a lengthy and
costly process. To revolutionize this process, we introduce our new concept
QMLS to shorten the whole R&amp;D phase to three to six months and decrease the
cost to merely fifty to eighty thousand USD. For Hit Generation, Machine
Learning Molecule Generation (MLMG) generates possible hits according to the
molecular structure of the target protein while the Quantum Simulation (QS)
filters molecules from the primary essay based on the reaction and binding
effectiveness with the target protein. Then, For Lead Optimization, the
resultant molecules generated and filtered from MLMG and QS are compared, and
molecules that appear as a result of both processes will be made into dozens of
molecular variations through Machine Learning Molecule Variation (MLMV), while
others will only be made into a few variations. Lastly, all optimized molecules
would undergo multiple rounds of QS filtering with a high standard for reaction
effectiveness and safety, creating a few dozen pre-clinical-trail-ready drugs.
This paper is based on our first paper, where we pitched the concept of machine
learning combined with quantum simulations. In this paper we will go over the
detailed design and framework of QMLS, including MLMG, MLMV, and QS.

<p class="mathjax">Classical methods of medical image super-resolution (MISR) utilize open-loop
architecture with implicit under-resolution (UR) unit and explicit
super-resolution (SR) unit. The UR unit can always be given, assumed, or
estimated, while the SR unit is elaborately designed according to various SR
algorithms. The closed-loop feedback mechanism is widely employed in current
MISR approaches and can efficiently improve their performance. The feedback
mechanism may be divided into two categories: local and global feedback.
Therefore, this paper proposes a global feedback-based closed-cycle framework,
circular MISR (CMISR), with unambiguous UR and SR elements. Mathematical model
and closed-loop equation of CMISR are built. Mathematical proof with
Taylor-series approximation indicates that CMISR has zero recovery error in
steady-state. In addition, CMISR holds plug-and-play characteristic which can
be established on any existing MISR algorithms. Five CMISR algorithms are
respectively proposed based on the state-of-the-art open-loop MISR algorithms.
Experimental results with three scale factors and on three open medical image
datasets show that CMISR is superior to MISR in reconstruction performance and
is particularly suited to medical images with strong edges or intense contrast.

<p class="mathjax">With the exponential increase of the protein sequence databases over time,
multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) methods, like PSI-BLAST, perform exhaustive
and time-consuming database search to retrieve evolutionary information. The
resulting position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) of such search engines
represent a crucial input to many machine learning (ML) models in the field of
bioinformatics and computational biology. A protein sequence is a collection of
contiguous tokens or characters called amino acids (AAs). The analogy to
natural language allowed us to exploit the recent advancements in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and therefore transfer NLP state-of-the-art
algorithms to bioinformatics. This research presents an Embedding Language
Model (ELMo), converting a protein sequence to a numerical vector
representation. While the original ELMo trained a 2-layer bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) network following a two-path architecture, one for
the forward and the second for the backward pass, by merging the idea of PSSMs
with the concept of transfer-learning, this work introduces a novel
bidirectional language model (bi-LM) with four times less free parameters and
using rather a single path for both passes. The model was trained not only on
predicting the next AA but also on the probability distribution of the next AA
derived from similar, yet different sequences as summarized in a PSSM,
simultaneously for multi-task learning, hence learning evolutionary information
of protein sequences as well. The network architecture and the pre-trained
model are made available as open source under the permissive MIT license on
GitHub at https://github.com/issararab/PEvoLM.

<p class="mathjax">Research and development investments are key to scientific and economic
development and to the well-being of society. Because scientific research
demands significant resources, national scientific investment is a crucial
driver of scientific production. As scientific production becomes increasingly
multinational, it is critically important to study how nations' scientific
activities are funded both domestically and internationally. By tracing
research grants acknowledged in scholarly publications, our study reveals a
duopoly of China and the United States in the global funding landscape, with a
contrasting funding pattern; while China has surpassed the United States both
in acknowledged domestic and international funding with its strong funding
activity for the Chinese institutions, the United States largely maintains its
place as the most important research partner for most countries. Our results
also highlight the precarity of low- and middle-income countries to global
funding disruptions. By revealing the complex interdependence and collaboration
between countries in the global scientific enterprise, our study informs future
studies investigating the national and global scientific enterprise and how
funding leads to both productive cooperation and dependencies.

<p class="mathjax">Learned image compression methods have shown superior rate-distortion
performance and remarkable potential compared to traditional compression
methods. Most existing learned approaches use stacked convolution or
window-based self-attention for transform coding, which aggregate spatial
information in a fixed range. In this paper, we focus on extending spatial
aggregation capability and propose a dynamic kernel-based transform coding. The
proposed adaptive aggregation generates kernel offsets to capture valid
information in the content-conditioned range to help transform. With the
adaptive aggregation strategy and the sharing weights mechanism, our method can
achieve promising transform capability with acceptable model complexity.
Besides, according to the recent progress of entropy model, we define a
generalized coarse-to-fine entropy model, considering the coarse global
context, the channel-wise, and the spatial context. Based on it, we introduce
dynamic kernel in hyper-prior to generate more expressive global context.
Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric spatial-channel entropy model according
to the investigation of the spatial characteristics of the grouped latents. The
asymmetric entropy model aims to reduce statistical redundancy while
maintaining coding efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves superior rate-distortion performance on three benchmarks compared to
the state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we present a computational framework tailored for the precise
detection and comprehensive analysis of nanoparticles within scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images. The primary objective of this framework revolves
around the accurate localization of nanoparticle coordinates, accompanied by
secondary objectives encompassing the extraction of pertinent morphological
attributes including area, orientation, brightness, and length.
<br />Constructed leveraging the robust image processing capabilities of Python,
particularly harnessing libraries such as OpenCV, SciPy, and Scikit-Image, the
framework employs an amalgamation of techniques, including thresholding,
dilating, and eroding, to enhance the fidelity of image processing outcomes.
<br />The ensuing nanoparticle data is seamlessly integrated into the RStudio
environment to facilitate meticulous post-processing analysis. This encompasses
a comprehensive evaluation of model accuracy, discernment of feature
distribution patterns, and the identification of intricate particle
arrangements. The finalized framework exhibits high nanoparticle identification
within the primary sample image and boasts 97\% accuracy in detecting particles
across five distinct test images drawn from a SEM nanoparticle dataset.
Furthermore, the framework demonstrates the capability to discern nanoparticles
of faint intensity, eluding manual labeling within the control group.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is the system description of the DKU-MSXF System for the track1,
track2 and track3 of the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2023
(VoxSRC-23). For Track 1, we utilize a network structure based on ResNet for
training. By constructing a cross-age QMF training set, we achieve a
substantial improvement in system performance. For Track 2, we inherite the
pre-trained model from Track 1 and conducte mixed training by incorporating the
VoxBlink-clean dataset. In comparison to Track 1, the models incorporating
VoxBlink-clean data exhibit a performance improvement by more than 10%
relatively. For Track3, the semi-supervised domain adaptation task, a novel
pseudo-labeling method based on triple thresholds and sub-center purification
is adopted to make domain adaptation. The final submission achieves mDCF of
0.1243 in task1, mDCF of 0.1165 in Track 2 and EER of 4.952% in Track 3.

<p class="mathjax">Currently, most speaker recognition backends, such as cosine, linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), or probabilistic linear discriminant analysis
(PLDA), make decisions by calculating similarity or distance between enrollment
and test embeddings which are already extracted from neural networks. However,
for each embedding, the local structure of itself and its neighbor embeddings
in the low-dimensional space is different, which may be helpful for the
recognition but is often ignored. In order to take advantage of it, we propose
a graph neural network (GNN) backend to mine latent relationships among
embeddings for classification. We assume all the embeddings as nodes on a
graph, and their edges are computed based on some similarity function, such as
cosine, LDA+cosine, or LDA+PLDA. We study different graph settings and explore
variants of GNN to find a better message passing and aggregation way to
accomplish the recognition task. Experimental results on NIST SRE14 i-vector
challenging, VoxCeleb1-O, VoxCeleb1-E, and VoxCeleb1-H datasets demonstrate
that our proposed GNN backends significantly outperform current mainstream
methods.

the Chinese labor market. We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities
by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following Eloundou et
al. (2023)'s methodology. We then aggregate occupation exposure to the industry
level to obtain industry exposure scores. The results indicate a positive
correlation between occupation exposure and wage levels/experience premiums,
suggesting higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater
displacement risks from LLM-powered software. The industry exposure scores
align with expert assessments and economic intuitions. We also develop an
economic growth model incorporating industry exposure to quantify the
productivity-employment trade-off from AI adoption. Overall, this study
provides an analytical basis for understanding the labor market impacts of
increasingly capable AI systems in China. Key innovations include the
occupation-level exposure analysis, industry aggregation approach, and economic
modeling incorporating AI adoption and labor market effects. The findings will
inform policymakers and businesses on strategies for maximizing the benefits of
AI while mitigating adverse disruption risks.

<p class="mathjax">The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an NP-optimization problem
(NPO) that arises in various fields including transportation and logistics. The
CVRP extends from the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), aiming to determine the
most efficient plan for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of
customers, subject to the limited carrying capacity of each vehicle. As the
number of possible solutions skyrockets when the number of customers increases,
finding the optimal solution remains a significant challenge. Recently, a
quantum-classical hybrid algorithm known as Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) can provide better solutions in some cases of combinatorial
optimization problems, compared to classical heuristics. However, the QAOA
exhibits a diminished ability to produce high-quality solutions for some
constrained optimization problems including the CVRP. One potential approach
for improvement involves a variation of the QAOA known as the Grover-Mixer
Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (GM-QAOA). In this work, we attempt to use
GM-QAOA to solve the CVRP. We present a new binary encoding for the CVRP, with
an alternative objective function of minimizing the shortest path that bypasses
the vehicle capacity constraint of the CVRP. The search space is further
restricted by the Grover-Mixer. We examine and discuss the effectiveness of the
proposed solver through its application to several illustrative examples.

<p class="mathjax">E-commerce, a type of trading that occurs at a high frequency on the
Internet, requires guaranteeing the integrity, authentication and
non-repudiation of messages through long distance. As current e-commerce
schemes are vulnerable to computational attacks, quantum cryptography, ensuring
information-theoretic security against adversary's repudiation and forgery,
provides a solution to this problem. However, quantum solutions generally have
much lower performance compared to classical ones. Besides, when considering
imperfect devices, the performance of quantum schemes exhibits a significant
decline. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the whole e-commerce process
of involving the signing of a contract and payment among three parties by
proposing a quantum e-commerce scheme, which shows resistance of attacks from
imperfect devices. Results show that with a maximum attenuation of 25 dB among
participants, our scheme can achieve a signature rate of 0.82 times per second
for an agreement size of approximately 0.428 megabit. This proposed scheme
presents a promising solution for providing information-theoretic security for
e-commerce.

<p class="mathjax">Motion-resolved reconstruction for abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
remains a challenge due to the trade-off between residual motion blurring
caused by discretized motion states and undersampling artefacts. In this work,
we propose to generate blurring-free motion-resolved abdominal reconstructions
by learning a neural implicit representation directly in k-space (NIK). Using
measured sampling points and a data-derived respiratory navigator signal, we
train a network to generate continuous signal values. To aid the regularization
of sparsely sampled regions, we introduce an additional informed correction
layer (ICo), which leverages information from neighboring regions to correct
NIK's prediction. Our proposed generative reconstruction methods, NIK and
ICoNIK, outperform standard motion-resolved reconstruction techniques and
provide a promising solution to address motion artefacts in abdominal MRI.

<p class="mathjax">For learning-based sound event localization and detection (SELD) methods,
different acoustic environments in the training and test sets may result in
large performance differences in the validation and evaluation stages.
Different environments, such as different sizes of rooms, different
reverberation times, and different background noise, may be reasons for a
learning-based system to fail. On the other hand, acquiring annotated spatial
sound event samples, which include onset and offset time stamps, class types of
sound events, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) of sound sources is very
expensive. In addition, deploying a SELD system in a new environment often
poses challenges due to time-consuming training and fine-tuning processes. To
address these issues, we propose Meta-SELD, which applies meta-learning methods
to achieve fast adaptation to new environments. More specifically, based on
Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), the proposed Meta-SELD aims to find good
meta-initialized parameters to adapt to new environments with only a small
number of samples and parameter updating iterations. We can then quickly adapt
the meta-trained SELD model to unseen environments. Our experiments compare
fine-tuning methods from pre-trained SELD models with our Meta-SELD on the
Sony-TAU Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSSS23) dataset. The evaluation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of Meta-SELD when adapting to new
environments.

<p class="mathjax">Graphical models have exhibited their performance in numerous tasks ranging
from biological analysis to recommender systems. However, graphical models with
hub nodes are computationally difficult to fit, particularly when the dimension
of the data is large. To efficiently estimate the hub graphical models, we
introduce a two-phase algorithm. The proposed algorithm first generates a good
initial point via a dual alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
and then warm starts a semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM) to compute a solution that is accurate enough for practical tasks.
The sparsity structure of the generalized Jacobian ensures that the algorithm
can obtain a nice solution very efficiently. Comprehensive experiments on both
synthetic data and real data show that it obviously outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, in some high dimensional tasks, it
can save more than 70\% of the execution time, meanwhile still achieves a
high-quality estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Phase information has a significant impact on speech perceptual quality and
intelligibility. However, existing speech enhancement methods encounter
limitations in explicit phase estimation due to the non-structural nature and
wrapping characteristics of the phase, leading to a bottleneck in enhanced
speech quality. To overcome the above issue, in this paper, we proposed
MP-SENet, a novel Speech Enhancement Network which explicitly enhances
Magnitude and Phase spectra in parallel. The proposed MP-SENet adopts a codec
architecture in which the encoder and decoder are bridged by time-frequency
Transformers along both time and frequency dimensions. The encoder aims to
encode time-frequency representations derived from the input distorted
magnitude and phase spectra. The decoder comprises dual-stream magnitude and
phase decoders, directly enhancing magnitude and wrapped phase spectra by
incorporating a magnitude estimation architecture and a phase parallel
estimation architecture, respectively. To train the MP-SENet model effectively,
we define multi-level loss functions, including mean square error and
perceptual metric loss of magnitude spectra, anti-wrapping loss of phase
spectra, as well as mean square error and consistency loss of short-time
complex spectra. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MP-SENet
excels in high-quality speech enhancement across multiple tasks, including
speech denoising, dereverberation, and bandwidth extension. Compared to
existing phase-aware speech enhancement methods, it successfully avoids the
bidirectional compensation effect between the magnitude and phase, leading to a
better harmonic restoration. Notably, for the speech denoising task, the
MP-SENet yields a state-of-the-art performance with a PESQ of 3.60 on the
public VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset.

<p class="mathjax">We study two notions of fan-planarity introduced by (Cheong et al., GD22),
called weak and strong fan-planarity that separate two non-equivalent
definitions of fan-planarity in the literature. We prove that not every weakly
fan-planar graph is strongly fan-planar, while the density upper bound for both
families is the same.

<p class="mathjax">In 1962 Ore initiated the study of geodetic graphs. A graph is called
geodetic if the shortest path between every pair of vertices is unique. In the
subsequent years a wide range of papers appeared investigating their peculiar
properties. Yet, a complete classification of geodetic graphs is out of reach.
<br />In this work we present a program enumerating all geodetic graphs of a given
size. Using our program, we succeed to find all geodetic graphs with up to 25
vertices and all regular geodetic graphs with up to 32 vertices. This leads to
the discovery of two new infinite families of geodetic graphs.

<p class="mathjax">Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic and relapsing disease
characterized by esophageal inflammation. Symptoms of EoE include difficulty
swallowing, food impaction, and chest pain which significantly impact the
quality of life, resulting in nutritional impairments, social limitations, and
psychological distress. The diagnosis of EoE is typically performed with a
threshold (15 to 20) of eosinophils (Eos) per high-power field (HPF). Since the
current counting process of Eos is a resource-intensive process for human
pathologists, automatic methods are desired. Circle representation has been
shown as a more precise, yet less complicated, representation for automatic
instance cell segmentation such as CircleSnake approach. However, the
CircleSnake was designed as a single-label model, which is not able to deal
with multi-label scenarios. In this paper, we propose the multi-label
CircleSnake model for instance segmentation on Eos. It extends the original
CircleSnake model from a single-label design to a multi-label model, allowing
segmentation of multiple object types. Experimental results illustrate the
CircleSnake model's superiority over the traditional Mask R-CNN model and
DeepSnake model in terms of average precision (AP) in identifying and
segmenting eosinophils, thereby enabling enhanced characterization of EoE. This
automated approach holds promise for streamlining the assessment process and
improving diagnostic accuracy in EoE analysis. The source code has been made
publicly available at https://github.com/yilinliu610730/EoE.

<p class="mathjax">We analyze the dynamics of streaming stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the
high-dimensional limit when applied to generalized linear models and
multi-index models (e.g. logistic regression, phase retrieval) with general
data-covariance. In particular, we demonstrate a deterministic equivalent of
SGD in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations that describes a
wide class of statistics, such as the risk and other measures of
sub-optimality. This equivalence holds with overwhelming probability when the
model parameter count grows proportionally to the number of data. This
framework allows us to obtain learning rate thresholds for stability of SGD as
well as convergence guarantees. In addition to the deterministic equivalent, we
introduce an SDE with a simplified diffusion coefficient (homogenized SGD)
which allows us to analyze the dynamics of general statistics of SGD iterates.
Finally, we illustrate this theory on some standard examples and show numerical
simulations which give an excellent match to the theory.

experiments based on generative adversarial networks. We treat the energy
depositions of simulated electromagnetic showers of photons and neutral-pion
decays in a toy electromagnetic calorimeter as 2D images and we train
super-resolution networks to generate images with an artificially increased
resolution by a factor of four in each dimension. The generated images are able
to reproduce features of the electromagnetic showers that are not obvious from
the images at nominal resolution. Using the artificially-enhanced images for
the reconstruction of shower-shape variables and of the position of the shower
center results in significant improvements. We additionally investigate the
utilization of the generated images as a pre-processing step for deep-learning
photon-identification algorithms and observe improvements in the case of low
training statistics.

<p class="mathjax">Data augmentation has become a de facto component of deep learning-based
medical image segmentation methods. Most data augmentation techniques used in
medical imaging focus on spatial and intensity transformations to improve the
diversity of training images. They are often designed at the image level,
augmenting the full image, and do not pay attention to specific abnormalities
within the image. Here, we present LesionMix, a novel and simple lesion-aware
data augmentation method. It performs augmentation at the lesion level,
increasing the diversity of lesion shape, location, intensity and load
distribution, and allowing both lesion populating and inpainting. Experiments
on different modalities and different lesion datasets, including four brain MR
lesion datasets and one liver CT lesion dataset, demonstrate that LesionMix
achieves promising performance in lesion image segmentation, outperforming
several recent Mix-based data augmentation methods. The code will be released
at https://github.com/dogabasaran/lesionmix.

<p class="mathjax">Developing objective methods for assessing the severity of Parkinson's
disease (PD) is crucial for improving the diagnosis and treatment. This study
proposes two sets of novel features derived from the single frequency filtering
(SFF) method: (1) SFF cepstral coefficients (SFFCC) and (2) MFCCs from the SFF
(MFCC-SFF) for the severity classification of PD. Prior studies have
demonstrated that SFF offers greater spectro-temporal resolution compared to
the short-time Fourier transform. The study uses the PC-GITA database, which
includes speech of PD patients and healthy controls produced in three speaking
tasks (vowels, sentences, text reading). Experiments using the SVM classifier
revealed that the proposed features outperformed the conventional MFCCs in all
three speaking tasks. The proposed SFFCC and MFCC-SFF features gave a relative
improvement of 5.8% and 2.3% for the vowel task, 7.0% &amp; 1.8% for the sentence
task, and 2.4% and 1.1% for the read text task, in comparison to MFCC features.

<p class="mathjax">Given $n$ observations from two balanced classes, consider the task of
labeling an additional $m$ inputs that are known to all belong to \emph{one} of
the two classes. Special cases of this problem are well-known: with complete
knowledge of class distributions ($n=\infty$) the problem is solved optimally
by the likelihood-ratio test; when $m=1$ it corresponds to binary
classification; and when $m\approx n$ it is equivalent to two-sample testing.
The intermediate settings occur in the field of likelihood-free inference,
where labeled samples are obtained by running forward simulations and the
unlabeled sample is collected experimentally. In recent work it was discovered
that there is a fundamental trade-off between $m$ and $n$: increasing the data
sample $m$ reduces the amount $n$ of training/simulation data needed. In this
work we (a) introduce a generalization where unlabeled samples come from a
mixture of the two classes -- a case often encountered in practice; (b) study
the minimax sample complexity for non-parametric classes of densities under
\textit{maximum mean discrepancy} (MMD) separation; and (c) investigate the
empirical performance of kernels parameterized by neural networks on two tasks:
detection of the Higgs boson and detection of planted DDPM generated images
amidst CIFAR-10 images. For both problems we confirm the existence of the
theoretically predicted asymmetric $m$ vs $n$ trade-off.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, formant tracking is investigated by refining the formants
tracked by an existing data-driven tracker, DeepFormants, using the formants
estimated in a model-driven manner by linear prediction (LP)-based methods. As
LP-based formant estimation methods, conventional covariance analysis (LP-COV)
and the recently proposed quasi-closed phase forward-backward (QCP-FB) analysis
are used. In the proposed refinement approach, the contours of the three lowest
formants are first predicted by the data-driven DeepFormants tracker, and the
predicted formants are replaced frame-wise with local spectral peaks shown by
the model-driven LP-based methods. The refinement procedure can be plugged into
the DeepFormants tracker with no need for any new data learning. Two refined
DeepFormants trackers were compared with the original DeepFormants and with
five known traditional trackers using the popular vocal tract resonance (VTR)
corpus. The results indicated that the data-driven DeepFormants trackers
outperformed the conventional trackers and that the best performance was
obtained by refining the formants predicted by DeepFormants using QCP-FB
analysis. In addition, by tracking formants using VTR speech that was corrupted
by additive noise, the study showed that the refined DeepFormants trackers were
more resilient to noise than the reference trackers. In general, these results
suggest that LP-based model-driven approaches, which have traditionally been
used in formant estimation, can be combined with a modern data-driven tracker
easily with no further training to improve the tracker's performance.

intrinsic variability of the experimental data is further compounded by data
aggregation practices that neglect heterogeneity to overcome sparsity. Here we
discuss the limitations of these practices and present a hierarchical
meta-learning framework that exploits the information synergy across disparate
assays by successfully accounting for assay heterogeneity. We show that the
model achieves a drastic improvement in affinity prediction across diverse
protein targets and assay types compared to conventional baselines. It can
quickly adapt to new target contexts using very few observations, thus enabling
large-scale virtual screening in early-phase drug discovery.

<p class="mathjax">Network complexity and computational efficiency have become increasingly
significant aspects of deep learning. Sparse deep learning addresses these
challenges by recovering a sparse representation of the underlying target
function by reducing heavily over-parameterized deep neural networks.
Specifically, deep neural architectures compressed via structured sparsity
(e.g. node sparsity) provide low latency inference, higher data throughput, and
reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we explore two well-established
shrinkage techniques, Lasso and Horseshoe, for model compression in Bayesian
neural networks. To this end, we propose structurally sparse Bayesian neural
networks which systematically prune excessive nodes with (i) Spike-and-Slab
Group Lasso (SS-GL), and (ii) Spike-and-Slab Group Horseshoe (SS-GHS) priors,
and develop computationally tractable variational inference including
continuous relaxation of Bernoulli variables. We establish the contraction
rates of the variational posterior of our proposed models as a function of the
network topology, layer-wise node cardinalities, and bounds on the network
weights. We empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our models
compared to the baseline models in prediction accuracy, model compression, and
inference latency.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a generalized information criterion that contains other
well-known information criteria, such as Bayesian information Criterion (BIC)
and Akaike information criterion (AIC), as special cases. Furthermore, the
proposed spectral information criterion (SIC) is also more general than the
other information criteria, e.g., since the knowledge of a likelihood function
is not strictly required. SIC extracts geometric features of the error curve
and, as a consequence, it can be considered an automatic elbow detector. SIC
provides a subset of all possible models, with a cardinality that often is much
smaller than the total number of possible models. The elements of this subset
are elbows of the error curve. A practical rule for selecting a unique model
within the sets of elbows is suggested as well. Theoretical invariance
properties of SIC are analyzed. Moreover, we test SIC in ideal scenarios where
provides always the optimal expected results. We also test SIC in several
numerical experiments: some involving synthetic data, and two experiments
involving real datasets. They are all real-world applications such as
clustering, variable selection, or polynomial order selection, to name a few.
The results show the benefits of the proposed scheme. Matlab code related to
the experiments is also provided. Possible future research lines are finally
discussed.

<p class="mathjax">JPEG compression adopts the quantization of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
coefficients for effective bit-rate reduction, whilst the quantization could
lead to a significant loss of important image details. Recovering compressed
JPEG images in the frequency domain has attracted more and more attention
recently, in addition to numerous restoration approaches developed in the pixel
domain. However, the current DCT domain methods typically suffer from limited
effectiveness in handling a wide range of compression quality factors, or fall
short in recovering sparse quantized coefficients and the components across
different colorspace. To address these challenges, we propose a DCT domain
spatial-frequential Transformer, named as DCTransformer. Specifically, a
dual-branch architecture is designed to capture both spatial and frequential
correlations within the collocated DCT coefficients. Moreover, we incorporate
the operation of quantization matrix embedding, which effectively allows our
single model to handle a wide range of quality factors, and a
luminance-chrominance alignment head that produces a unified feature map to
align different-sized luminance and chrominance components. Our proposed
DCTransformer outperforms the current state-of-the-art JPEG artifact removal
techniques, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based surrogate models have been widely applied in geological
carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir
pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based
numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the
complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the
available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to
the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity
Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable
multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable
grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure
between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model
efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The
multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity
model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data
generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity
model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid
cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and
low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and
reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict
pressure fields with reasonable accuracy even when the high-fidelity data are
extremely limited.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML)-based force fields are attracting ever-increasing
interest due to their capacity to span spatiotemporal scales of classical
interatomic potentials at quantum-level accuracy. They can be trained based on
high-fidelity simulations or experiments, the former being the common case.
However, both approaches are impaired by scarce and erroneous data resulting in
models that either do not agree with well-known experimental observations or
are under-constrained and only reproduce some properties. Here we leverage both
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experimentally measured
mechanical properties and lattice parameters to train an ML potential of
titanium. We demonstrate that the fused data learning strategy can concurrently
satisfy all target objectives, thus resulting in a molecular model of higher
accuracy compared to the models trained with a single data source. The
inaccuracies of DFT functionals at target experimental properties were
corrected, while the investigated off-target properties remained largely
unperturbed. Our approach is applicable to any material and can serve as a
general strategy to obtain highly accurate ML potentials.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate 3D cardiac reconstruction from cine magnetic resonance imaging
(cMRI) is crucial for improved cardiovascular disease diagnosis and
understanding of the heart's motion. However, current cardiac MRI-based
reconstruction technology used in clinical settings is 2D with limited
through-plane resolution, resulting in low-quality reconstructed cardiac
volumes. To better reconstruct 3D cardiac volumes from sparse 2D image stacks,
we propose a morphology-guided diffusion model for 3D cardiac volume
reconstruction, DMCVR, that synthesizes high-resolution 2D images and
corresponding 3D reconstructed volumes. Our method outperforms previous
approaches by conditioning the cardiac morphology on the generative model,
eliminating the time-consuming iterative optimization process of the latent
code, and improving generation quality. The learned latent spaces provide
global semantics, local cardiac morphology and details of each 2D cMRI slice
with highly interpretable value to reconstruct 3D cardiac shape. Our
experiments show that DMCVR is highly effective in several aspects, such as 2D
generation and 3D reconstruction performance. With DMCVR, we can produce
high-resolution 3D cardiac MRI reconstructions, surpassing current techniques.
Our proposed framework has great potential for improving the accuracy of
cardiac disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Code can be accessed at

<p class="mathjax">This study introduces multi-task pseudo-label (MPL) learning for a
non-intrusive speech quality assessment model. MPL consists of two stages which
are obtaining pseudo-label scores from a pretrained model and performing
multi-task learning. The 3QUEST metrics, namely Speech-MOS (S-MOS), Noise-MOS
(N-MOS), and General-MOS (G-MOS) are selected as the primary ground-truth
labels. Additionally, the pretrained MOSA-Net model is utilized to estimate
three pseudo-labels: perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time
objective intelligibility (STOI), and speech distortion index (SDI). Multi-task
learning stage of MPL is then employed to train the MTQ-Net model (multi-target
speech quality assessment network). The model is optimized by incorporating
Loss supervision (derived from the difference between the estimated score and
the real ground-truth labels) and Loss semi-supervision (derived from the
difference between the estimated score and pseudo-labels), where Huber loss is
employed to calculate the loss function. Experimental results first demonstrate
the advantages of MPL compared to training the model from scratch and using
knowledge transfer mechanisms. Secondly, the benefits of Huber Loss in
improving the prediction model of MTQ-Net are verified. Finally, the MTQ-Net
with the MPL approach exhibits higher overall prediction capabilities when
compared to other SSL-based speech assessment models.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of finite sums minimization, variance reduction techniques are
widely used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art stochastic gradient
methods. Their practical impact is clear, as well as their theoretical
properties. Stochastic proximal point algorithms have been studied as an
alternative to stochastic gradient algorithms since they are more stable with
respect to the choice of the stepsize but a proper variance reduced version is
missing. In this work, we propose the first study of variance reduction
techniques for stochastic proximal point algorithms. We introduce a stochastic
proximal version of SVRG, SAGA, and some of their variants for smooth and
convex functions. We provide several convergence results for the iterates and
the objective function values. In addition, under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
(PL) condition, we obtain linear convergence rates for the iterates and the
function values. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the
proximal variance reduction methods over their gradient counterparts,
especially about the stability with respect to the choice of the step size.

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting the state of a system from an observed time series is the subject
of research in many domains, such as computational neuroscience. Here, the
prediction of epileptic seizures from brain measurements is an unresolved
problem. There are neither complete models describing underlying brain
dynamics, nor do individual patients exhibit a single seizure onset pattern,
which complicates the development of a `one-size-fits-all' solution. Based on a
longitudinal patient data set, we address the automated discovery and
quantification of statistical features (biomarkers) that can be used to
forecast seizures in a patient-specific way. We use existing and novel feature
extraction algorithms, in particular the path signature, a recent development
in time series analysis. Of particular interest is how this set of complex,
nonlinear features performs compared to simpler, linear features on this task.
Our inference is based on statistical classification algorithms with in-built
subset selection to discern time series with and without an impending seizure
while selecting only a small number of relevant features. This study may be
seen as a step towards a generalisable pattern recognition pipeline for time
series in a broader context.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention in the
field of image segmentation due to its impressive capabilities and prompt-based
interface. While SAM has already been extensively evaluated in various domains,
its adaptation to retinal OCT scans remains unexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of SAM and its adaptations on a
large-scale public dataset of OCTs from RETOUCH challenge. Our evaluation
covers diverse retinal diseases, fluid compartments, and device vendors,
comparing SAM against state-of-the-art retinal fluid segmentation methods.
Through our analysis, we showcase adapted SAM's efficacy as a powerful
segmentation model in retinal OCT scans, although still lagging behind
established methods in some circumstances. The findings highlight SAM's
adaptability and robustness, showcasing its utility as a valuable tool in
retinal OCT image analysis and paving the way for further advancements in this
domain.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Automated segmentation of spinal MR images plays a vital role
both scientifically and clinically. However, accurately delineating posterior
spine structures presents challenges.
<br />Methods: This retrospective study, approved by the ethical committee,
involved translating T1w and T2w MR image series into CT images in a total of
n=263 pairs of CT/MR series. Landmark-based registration was performed to align
image pairs. We compared 2D paired (Pix2Pix, denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) image mode, DDIM noise mode) and unpaired (contrastive unpaired
translation, SynDiff) image-to-image translation using "peak signal to noise
ratio" (PSNR) as quality measure. A publicly available segmentation network
segmented the synthesized CT datasets, and Dice scores were evaluated on
in-house test sets and the "MRSpineSeg Challenge" volumes. The 2D findings were
extended to 3D Pix2Pix and DDIM.
<br />Results: 2D paired methods and SynDiff exhibited similar translation
performance and Dice scores on paired data. DDIM image mode achieved the
highest image quality. SynDiff, Pix2Pix, and DDIM image mode demonstrated
similar Dice scores (0.77). For craniocaudal axis rotations, at least two
landmarks per vertebra were required for registration. The 3D translation
outperformed the 2D approach, resulting in improved Dice scores (0.80) and
anatomically accurate segmentations in a higher resolution than the original MR
image.
<br />Conclusion: Two landmarks per vertebra registration enabled paired
image-to-image translation from MR to CT and outperformed all unpaired
approaches. The 3D techniques provided anatomically correct segmentations,
avoiding underprediction of small structures like the spinous process.

<p class="mathjax">The last success problem is an optimal stopping problem that aims to maximize
the probability of stopping on the last success in a sequence of $n$ Bernoulli
trials. In a typical setting where complete information about the distributions
is available, Bruss provided an optimal stopping policy ensuring a winning
probability of $1/e$. However, assuming complete knowledge of the distributions
is unrealistic in many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate a
variant of the last success problem where we have single-sample access from
each distribution instead of having comprehensive knowledge of the
distributions. Nuti and Vondr\'{a}k demonstrated that a winning probability
exceeding $1/4$ is unachievable for this setting, but it remains unknown
whether a stopping policy that meets this bound exists. We reveal that Bruss's
policy, when applied with the estimated success probabilities, cannot ensure a
winning probability greater than $(1-e^{-4})/4\approx 0.2454~(&lt; 1/4)$,
irrespective of the estimations from the given samples. Nevertheless, we
demonstrate that by setting the threshold the second-to-last success in samples
and stopping on the first success observed \emph{after} this threshold, a
winning probability of $1/4$ can be guaranteed.

phenomena of deep neural net (DNN) classifiers. This is done from the
perspective of Boolean functions by asking if certain sequences of Boolean
functions represented by common DNN models are noise sensitive or noise stable,
concepts defined in the Boolean function literature. Due to the natural
randomness in DNN models, these concepts are extended to annealed and quenched

<p class="mathjax">Spectral pixels are often a mixture of the pure spectra of the materials,
called endmembers, due to the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral sensors,
double scattering, and intimate mixtures of materials in the scenes. Unmixing
estimates the fractional abundances of the endmembers within the pixel.
Depending on the prior knowledge of endmembers, linear unmixing can be divided
into three main groups: supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised (blind)
linear unmixing. Advances in Image processing and machine learning
substantially affected unmixing. This paper provides an overview of advanced
and conventional unmixing approaches. Additionally, we draw a critical
comparison between advanced and conventional techniques from the three
categories. We compare the performance of the unmixing techniques on three
simulated and two real datasets. The experimental results reveal the advantages
of different unmixing categories for different unmixing scenarios. Moreover, we
provide an open-source Python-based package available at
https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/HySUPP to reproduce the results.

<p class="mathjax">The log-conformation formulation, although highly successful, was from the
beginning formulated as a partial differential equation that contains an, for
PDEs unusual, eigenvalue decomposition of the unknown field. To this day, most
numerical implementations have been based on this or a similar eigenvalue
decomposition, with Knechtges et al. (2014) being the only notable exception
for two-dimensional flows.
<br />In this paper, we present an eigenvalue-free algorithm to compute the
constitutive equation of the log-conformation formulation that works for two-
and three-dimensional flows. Therefore, we first prove that the challenging
terms in the constitutive equations are representable as a matrix function of a
slightly modified matrix of the log-conformation field. We give a proof of
equivalence of this term to the more common log-conformation formulations.
Based on this formulation, we develop an eigenvalue-free algorithm to evaluate
this matrix function. The resulting full formulation is first discretized using
a finite volume method, and then tested on the confined cylinder and
sedimenting sphere benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Metainformation is a common companion to biomedical images. However, this
potentially powerful additional source of signal from image acquisition has had
limited use in deep learning methods, for semantic segmentation in particular.
Here, we incorporate metadata by employing a channel modulation mechanism in
convolutional networks and study its effect on semantic segmentation tasks. We
demonstrate that metadata as additional input to a convolutional network can
improve segmentation results while being inexpensive in implementation as a
nimble add-on to popular models. We hypothesize that this benefit of metadata
can be attributed to facilitating multitask switching. This aspect of
metadata-driven systems is explored and discussed in detail.

<p class="mathjax">Single-particle traces of the diffusive motion of molecules, cells, or
animals are by-now routinely measured, similar to stochastic records of stock
prices or weather data. Deciphering the stochastic mechanism behind the
recorded dynamics is vital in understanding the observed systems. Typically,
the task is to decipher the exact type of diffusion and/or to determine system
parameters. The tools used in this endeavor are currently revolutionized by
modern machine-learning techniques. In this Perspective we provide an overview
over recently introduced methods in machine-learning for diffusive time series,
most notably, those successfully competing in the
Anomalous-Diffusion-Challenge. As such methods are often criticized for their
lack of interpretability, we focus on means to include uncertainty estimates
and feature-based approaches, both improving interpretability and providing
concrete insight into the learning process of the machine. We expand the
discussion by examining predictions on different out-of-distribution data. We
also comment on expected future developments.

<p class="mathjax">Computational models are an essential tool for understanding the origin and
functions of the topographic organisation of the primate visual system. Yet,
vision is most commonly modelled by convolutional neural networks that ignore
topography by learning identical features across space. Here, we overcome this
limitation by developing All-Topographic Neural Networks (All-TNNs). Trained on
visual input, several features of primate topography emerge in All-TNNs: smooth
orientation maps and cortical magnification in their first layer, and
category-selective areas in their final layer. In addition, we introduce a
novel dataset of human spatial biases in object recognition, which enables us
to directly link models to behaviour. We demonstrate that All-TNNs
significantly better align with human behaviour than previous state-of-the-art
convolutional models due to their topographic nature. All-TNNs thereby mark an
important step forward in understanding the spatial organisation of the visual
brain and how it mediates visual behaviour.

<p class="mathjax">Measuring cross-sectional areas in ultrasound images is a standard tool to
evaluate disease progress or treatment response. Often addressed today with
supervised deep-learning segmentation approaches, existing solutions highly
depend upon the quality of experts' annotations. However, the annotation
quality in ultrasound is anisotropic and position-variant due to the inherent
physical imaging principles, including attenuation, shadows, and missing
boundaries, commonly exacerbated with depth. This work proposes a novel
approach that guides ultrasound segmentation networks to account for
sonographers' uncertainties and generate predictions with variability similar
to the experts. We claim that realistic variability can reduce overconfident
predictions and improve physicians' acceptance of deep-learning cross-sectional
segmentation solutions. Our method provides CM's certainty for each pixel for
minimal computational overhead as it can be precalculated directly from the
image. We show that there is a correlation between low values in the confidence
maps and expert's label uncertainty. Therefore, we propose to give the
confidence maps as additional information to the networks. We study the effect
of the proposed use of ultrasound CMs in combination with four state-of-the-art
neural networks and in two configurations: as a second input channel and as
part of the loss. We evaluate our method on 3D ultrasound datasets of the
thyroid and lower limb muscles. Our results show ultrasound CMs increase the
Dice score, improve the Hausdorff and Average Surface Distances, and decrease
the number of isolated pixel predictions. Furthermore, our findings suggest
that ultrasound CMs improve the penalization of uncertain areas in the ground
truth data, thereby improving problematic interpolations. Our code and example
data will be made public at

<p class="mathjax">An important element of the $S$-matrix bootstrap program is the relationship
between the modulus of an $S$-matrix element and its phase. Unitarity relates
them by an integral equation. Even in the simplest case of elastic scattering,
this integral equation cannot be solved analytically and numerical approaches
are required. We apply modern machine learning techniques to studying the
unitarity constraint. We find that for a given modulus, when a phase exists it
can generally be reconstructed to good accuracy with machine learning.
Moreover, the loss of the reconstruction algorithm provides a good proxy for
whether a given modulus can be consistent with unitarity at all. In addition,
we study the question of whether multiple phases can be consistent with a
single modulus, finding novel phase-ambiguous solutions. In particular, we find
a new phase-ambiguous solution which pushes the known limit on such solutions
significantly beyond the previous bound.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a new accelerated proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo
methodology to perform Bayesian inference in imaging inverse problems with an
underlying convex geometry. The proposed strategy takes the form of a
stochastic relaxed proximal-point iteration that admits two complementary
interpretations. For models that are smooth or regularised by Moreau-Yosida
smoothing, the algorithm is equivalent to an implicit midpoint discretisation
of an overdamped Langevin diffusion targeting the posterior distribution of
interest. This discretisation is asymptotically unbiased for Gaussian targets
and shown to converge in an accelerated manner for any target that is
$\kappa$-strongly log-concave (i.e., requiring in the order of $\sqrt{\kappa}$
iterations to converge, similarly to accelerated optimisation schemes),
comparing favorably to [M. Pereyra, L. Vargas Mieles, K.C. Zygalakis, SIAM J.
Imaging Sciences, 13, 2 (2020), pp. 905-935] which is only provably accelerated
for Gaussian targets and has bias. For models that are not smooth, the
algorithm is equivalent to a Leimkuhler-Matthews discretisation of a Langevin
diffusion targeting a Moreau-Yosida approximation of the posterior distribution
of interest, and hence achieves a significantly lower bias than conventional
unadjusted Langevin strategies based on the Euler-Maruyama discretisation. For
targets that are $\kappa$-strongly log-concave, the provided non-asymptotic
convergence analysis also identifies the optimal time step which maximizes the
convergence speed. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through a range of
experiments related to image deconvolution with Gaussian and Poisson noise,
with assumption-driven and data-driven convex priors.

<p class="mathjax">The data-driven approach of supervised learning methods has limited
applicability in solving dipole inversion in Quantitative Susceptibility
Mapping (QSM) with varying scan parameters across different objects. To address
this generalization issue in supervised QSM methods, we propose a novel
training-free model-based unsupervised method called MoDIP (Model-based Deep
Image Prior). MoDIP comprises a small, untrained network and a Data Fidelity
Optimization (DFO) module. The network converges to an interim state, acting as
an implicit prior for image regularization, while the optimization process
enforces the physical model of QSM dipole inversion. Experimental results
demonstrate MoDIP's excellent generalizability in solving QSM dipole inversion
across different scan parameters. It exhibits robustness against pathological
brain QSM, achieving over 32% accuracy improvement than supervised deep
learning and traditional iterative methods. It is also 33% more computationally
efficient and runs 4 times faster than conventional DIP-based approaches,
enabling 3D high-resolution image reconstruction in under 4.5 minutes.

<p class="mathjax">Protein language models learn powerful representations directly from
sequences of amino acids. However, they are constrained to generate proteins
with only the set of amino acids represented in their vocabulary. In contrast,
chemical language models learn atom-level representations of smaller molecules
that include every atom, bond, and ring. In this work, we show that chemical
language models can learn atom-level representations of proteins enabling
protein generation unconstrained to the standard genetic code and far beyond
it. In doing so, we show that language models can generate entire proteins atom
by atom -- effectively learning the multiple hierarchical layers of molecular
information that define proteins from their primary sequence to their
secondary, and tertiary structure. We demonstrate language models are able to
explore beyond protein space -- generating proteins with modified sidechains
that form unnatural amino acids. Even further, we find that language models can
explore chemical space and protein space simultaneously and generate novel
examples of protein-drug conjugates. The results demonstrate the potential for
biomolecular design at the atom level using language models.

test scores to predict a distribution of scores for each pair of reference and
coded input stereo or binaural signals. We nickname this method the Generative
Machine Listener (GML), as it is capable of generating an arbitrary amount of

over mean scores, we observe lower outlier ratios (OR) for the mean score
predictions, and obtain easy access to the prediction of confidence intervals

<p class="mathjax">Efficient methods for the simulation of quantum circuits on classic computers
are crucial for their improvement and better understanding. Unfortunately,
classic array-based simulation of quantum circuits suffers from the curse of
dimensionality because the size of the arrays is exponential in the number of
qubits. Starting from the observation that results of quantum circuits are
often evaluated by means of quantum measurements that capture only a subpart of
the entire quantum state, we introduce measurement-preserving reductions. The
proposed technique complements existing approaches and can be closely aligned
to model reduction approaches from systems biology and control engineering. By
providing a publicly available prototype implementation, we demonstrate the
applicability of the approach by obtaining substantial reductions of common
quantum computing benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">The application of deep learning models to large-scale data sets requires
means for automatic quality assurance. We have previously developed a fully
automatic algorithm for carotid artery wall segmentation in black-blood MRI
that we aim to apply to large-scale data sets. This method identifies nested
artery walls in 3D patches centered on the carotid artery. In this study, we
investigate to what extent the uncertainty in the model predictions for the
contour location can serve as a surrogate for error detection and,
consequently, automatic quality assurance. We express the quality of automatic
segmentations using the Dice similarity coefficient. The uncertainty in the
model's prediction is estimated using either Monte Carlo dropout or test-time
data augmentation. We found that (1) including uncertainty measurements did not
degrade the quality of the segmentations, (2) uncertainty metrics provide a
good proxy of the quality of our contours if the center found during the first
step is enclosed in the lumen of the carotid artery and (3) they could be used
to detect low-quality segmentations at the participant level. This automatic
quality assurance tool might enable the application of our model in large-scale
data sets.

<p class="mathjax">Addressing fairness in lesion classification from dermatological images is
crucial due to variations in how skin diseases manifest across skin tones.
However, the absence of skin tone labels in public datasets hinders building a
fair classifier. To date, such skin tone labels have been estimated prior to
fairness analysis in independent studies using the Individual Typology Angle
(ITA). Briefly, ITA calculates an angle based on pixels extracted from skin
images taking into account the lightness and yellow-blue tints. These angles
are then categorised into skin tones that are subsequently used to analyse
fairness in skin cancer classification. In this work, we review and compare
four ITA-based approaches of skin tone classification on the ISIC18 dataset, a
common benchmark for assessing skin cancer classification fairness in the
literature. Our analyses reveal a high disagreement among previously published
studies demonstrating the risks of ITA-based skin tone estimation methods.
Moreover, we investigate the causes of such large discrepancy among these
approaches and find that the lack of diversity in the ISIC18 dataset limits its
use as a testbed for fairness analysis. Finally, we recommend further research
on robust ITA estimation and diverse dataset acquisition with skin tone
annotation to facilitate conclusive fairness assessments of artificial
intelligence tools in dermatology. Our code is available at
https://github.com/tkalbl/RevisitingSkinToneFairness.

<p class="mathjax">Neural-network quantum states (NQSs), variationally optimized by combining
traditional methods and deep learning techniques, is a new way to find quantum
many-body ground states and gradually becomes a competitor of traditional
variational methods. However, there are still some difficulties in the
optimization of NQSs, such as local minima, slow convergence, and sign
structure optimization. Here, we split a quantum many-body variational wave
function into a multiplication of a real-valued amplitude neural network and a
sign structure, and focus on the optimization of the amplitude network while
keeping the sign structure fixed. The amplitude network is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with residual blocks, namely a ResNet. Our method is
tested on three typical quantum many-body systems. The obtained ground state
energies are lower than or comparable to those from traditional variational
Monte Carlo (VMC) methods and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).
Surprisingly, for the frustrated Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model, our results are
better than those of the complex-valued CNN in the literature, implying that
the sign structure of the complex-valued NQS is difficult to be optimized. We
will study the optimization of the sign structure of NQSs in the future.

community for its potential application on nuclear materials. One challenge is
to obtain desired material properties via controlling the manufacturing process
during runtime. Intelligent AM based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
relies on an automated process-level control mechanism to generate optimal
design variables and adaptive system settings for improved end-product
properties. A high-fidelity thermo-mechanical model for direct energy
deposition has recently been developed within the MOOSE framework at the Idaho
National Laboratory (INL). The goal of this work is to develop an accurate and
fast-running reduced order model (ROM) for this MOOSE-based AM model that can
be used in a DRL-based process control and optimization method. Operator
learning (OL)-based methods will be employed due to their capability to learn a
family of differential equations, in this work, produced by changing process
variables in the Gaussian point heat source for the laser. We will develop
OL-based ROM using Fourier neural operator, and perform a benchmark comparison
of its performance with a conventional deep neural network-based ROM.

<p class="mathjax">Clustering is one of the most important tools for analysis of large datasets,
and perhaps the most popular clustering algorithm is Lloyd's iteration for
$k$-means. This iteration takes $N$ vectors $v_1,\dots,v_N\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and
outputs $k$ centroids $c_1,\dots,c_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$; these partition the
vectors into clusters based on which centroid is closest to a particular
vector. We present an overall improved version of the "$q$-means" algorithm,
the quantum algorithm originally proposed by Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and
Prakash (2019) which performs $\varepsilon$-$k$-means, an approximate version
of $k$-means clustering. This algorithm does not rely on the quantum linear
algebra primitives of prior work, instead only using its QRAM to prepare and
measure simple states based on the current iteration's clusters. The time
complexity is $O\big(\frac{k^{2}}{\varepsilon^2}(\sqrt{k}d + \log(Nd))\big)$
and maintains the polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ while improving the
dependence on most of the other parameters. We also present a "dequantized"
algorithm for $\varepsilon$-$k$-means which runs in
$O\big(\frac{k^{2}}{\varepsilon^2}(kd + \log(Nd))\big)$ time. Notably, this
classical algorithm matches the polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ attained by
the quantum algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate quantum phase transitions in the transverse field Ising chain
with algebraically decaying long-range antiferromagnetic interactions by using
the variational Monte Carlo method with the restricted Boltzmann machine being
employed as a trial wave function ansatz. In the finite-size scaling analysis
with the order parameter and the second R\'enyi entropy, we find that the
central charge deviates from 1/2 at a small decay exponent $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$
in contrast to the critical exponents staying very close to the short-range
(SR) Ising values regardless of $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$ examined, supporting the
previously proposed scenario of conformal invariance breakdown. To identify the
threshold of the Ising universality and the conformal symmetry, we perform two
additional tests for the universal Binder ratio and the conformal field theory
(CFT) description of the correlation function. It turns out that both indicate
a noticeable deviation from the SR Ising class at $\alpha_\mathrm{LR} &lt; 2$.
However, a closer look at the scaled correlation function for
$\alpha_\mathrm{LR} \ge 2$ shows a gradual change from the asymptotic line of
the CFT verified at $\alpha_\mathrm{LR} = 3$, providing a rough estimate of the
threshold being in the range of $2 \lesssim \alpha_\mathrm{LR} &lt; 3$.

<p class="mathjax">A standard approach to solve ordinary differential equations, when they
describe dynamical systems, is to adopt a Runge-Kutta or related scheme. Such
schemes, however, are not applicable to the large class of equations which do
not constitute dynamical systems. In several physical systems, we encounter
integro-differential equations with memory terms where the time derivative of a
state variable at a given time depends on all past states of the system.
Secondly, there are equations whose solutions do not have well-defined Taylor
series expansion. The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equation, which describes the
dynamics of an inertial particle in nonuniform and unsteady flow, displays both
challenges. We use it as a test bed to address the questions we raise, but our
method may be applied to all equations of this class. We show that the
Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equation can be embedded into an extended Markovian system
which is constructed by introducing a new dynamical co-evolving state variable
that encodes memory of past states. We develop a Runge-Kutta algorithm for the
resultant Markovian system. The form of the kernels involved in deriving the
Runge-Kutta scheme necessitates the use of an expansion in powers of $t^{1/2}$.
Our approach naturally inherits the benefits of standard time-integrators,
namely a constant memory storage cost, a linear growth of operational effort
with simulation time, and the ability to restart a simulation with the final
state as the new initial condition.
