<p class="mathjax">In this paper we describe a deep learning--based probabilistic algorithm for
integer factorisation. We use Lawrence's extension of Fermat's factorisation
algorithm to reduce the integer factorisation problem to a binary
classification problem. To address the classification problem, based on the
ease of generating large pseudo--random primes, a corpus of training data, as
large as needed, is synthetically generated. We will introduce the algorithm,
summarise some experiments, analyse where these experiments fall short, and
finally put out a call to others to reproduce, verify and see if this approach
can be improved to a point where it becomes a practical, scalable factorisation
algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in
multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of
parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning.
However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes
challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL)
emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively
train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate
client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have
adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a
small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during
federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a
single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data
heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a
finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated
Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a
Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the
client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an
efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an
efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of
heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with
different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms
the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.

<p class="mathjax">Tablature notation is widely used in popular music to transcribe and share
guitar musical content. As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures
transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a
variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides,
hammer-on/pull-off or bends.This paper focuses on bends, which enable to
progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical
limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a
set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to
study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future
short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar
tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts
bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 anda limited amount of false positive
predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of
non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.

<p class="mathjax">NPN classification has many applications in the synthesis and verification of
digital circuits. The canonical-form-based method is the most common approach,
designing a canonical form as representative for the NPN equivalence class
first and then computing the transformation function according to the canonical
form. Most works use variable symmetries and several signatures, mainly based
on the cofactor, to simplify the canonical form construction and computation.
This paper describes a novel canonical form and its computation algorithm by
introducing Boolean influence to NPN classification, which is a basic concept
in analysis of Boolean functions. We show that influence is
input-negation-independent, input-permutation-dependent, and has other
structural information than previous signatures for NPN classification.
Therefore, it is a significant ingredient in speeding up NPN classification.
Experimental results prove that influence plays an important role in reducing
the transformation enumeration in computing the canonical form. Compared with
the state-of-the-art algorithm implemented in ABC, our influence-aided
canonical form for exact NPN classification gains up to 5.5x speedup.

<p class="mathjax">As AI systems have obtained significant performance to be deployed widely in
our daily live and human society, people both enjoy the benefits brought by
these technologies and suffer many social issues induced by these systems. To
make AI systems good enough and trustworthy, plenty of researches have been
done to build guidelines for trustworthy AI systems. Machine learning is one of
the most important parts for AI systems and representation learning is the
fundamental technology in machine learning. How to make the representation
learning trustworthy in real-world application, e.g., cross domain scenarios,
is very valuable and necessary for both machine learning and AI system fields.
Inspired by the concepts in trustworthy AI, we proposed the first trustworthy
representation learning across domains framework which includes four concepts,
i.e, robustness, privacy, fairness, and explainability, to give a comprehensive
literature review on this research direction. Specifically, we first introduce
the details of the proposed trustworthy framework for representation learning
across domains. Second, we provide basic notions and comprehensively summarize
existing methods for the trustworthy framework from four concepts. Finally, we
conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research
directions.

(Graph Neural SDEs). This technique enhances the Graph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (Graph Neural ODEs) by embedding randomness into data
representation using Brownian motion. This inclusion allows for the assessment
of prediction uncertainty, a crucial aspect frequently missed in current
models. In our framework, we spotlight the \textit{Latent Graph Neural SDE}

that Latent Graph Neural SDEs surpass conventional models like Graph
Convolutional Networks and Graph Neural ODEs, especially in confidence

<p class="mathjax">Despite over 40 years' development of optical logic computing, the studies
have been still struggling to support more than four operands, since the high
parallelism of light has not been fully leveraged blocked by the optical
nonlinearity and redundant input modulation in existing methods. Here, we
propose a scalable multi-input optical programmable logic array (PLA) with
minimal logical input, enabled by parallel spectrum modulation. By making full
use of the wavelength resource, an eight-input PLA is experimentally
demonstrated, and there are 2^256 possible combinations of generated logic
gates. Various complex logic fuctions, such as 8-256 decoder, 4-bit comparator,
adder and multiplier are experimentally demonstrated via leveraging the PLA.
The scale of PLA can be further extended by fully using the dimensions of
wavelength and space. As an example, a nine-input PLA is implemented to realize
the two-dimensional optical cellular automaton for the first time and perform
Conway's Game of Life to simulate the evolutionary process of cells. Our work
significantly alleviates the challenge of extensibility of optical logic
devices, opening up new avenues for future large-scale, high-speed and
energy-efficient optical digital computing.

<p class="mathjax">With the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) remarkably improving,
DNNs have been widely used in many areas. Consequently, the DNN model has
become a valuable asset, and its intellectual property is safeguarded by
ownership verification techniques (e.g., DNN fingerprinting). However, the
feasibility of the DNN fingerprint removal attack and its potential influence
remains an open problem. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive
investigation of DNN fingerprint removal attacks. Generally, the knowledge
contained in a DNN model can be categorized into general semantic and
fingerprint-specific knowledge. To this end, we propose a min-max bilevel
optimization-based DNN fingerprint removal attack named RemovalNet, to evade
model ownership verification. The lower-level optimization is designed to
remove fingerprint-specific knowledge. While in the upper-level optimization,
we distill the victim model's general semantic knowledge to maintain the
surrogate model's performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
fidelity, effectiveness, and efficiency of the RemovalNet against four advanced
defense methods on six metrics. The empirical results demonstrate that (1) the
RemovalNet is effective. After our DNN fingerprint removal attack, the model
distance between the target and surrogate models is x100 times higher than that
of the baseline attacks, (2) the RemovalNet is efficient. It uses only 0.2%
(400 samples) of the substitute dataset and 1,000 iterations to conduct our
attack. Besides, compared with advanced model stealing attacks, the RemovalNet
saves nearly 85% of computational resources at most, (3) the RemovalNet
achieves high fidelity that the created surrogate model maintains high accuracy
after the DNN fingerprint removal process. Our code is available at:
https://github.com/grasses/RemovalNet.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding dark scenes based on multi-modal image data is challenging, as
both the visible and auxiliary modalities provide limited semantic information
for the task. Previous methods focus on fusing the two modalities but neglect
the correlations among semantic classes when minimizing losses to align pixels
with labels, resulting in inaccurate class predictions. To address these
issues, we introduce a supervised multi-modal contrastive learning approach to
increase the semantic discriminability of the learned multi-modal feature
spaces by jointly performing cross-modal and intra-modal contrast under the
supervision of the class correlations. The cross-modal contrast encourages
same-class embeddings from across the two modalities to be closer and pushes
different-class ones apart. The intra-modal contrast forces same-class or
different-class embeddings within each modality to be together or apart. We
validate our approach on a variety of tasks that cover diverse light conditions
and image modalities. Experiments show that our approach can effectively
enhance dark scene understanding based on multi-modal images with limited
semantics by shaping semantic-discriminative feature spaces. Comparisons with
previous methods demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance. Code and
pretrained models are available at https://github.com/palmdong/SMMCL.

<p class="mathjax">The 5G networks have extensively promoted the growth of mobile users and
novel applications, and with the skyrocketing user requests for a large amount
of popular content, the consequent content delivery services (CDSs) have been
bringing a heavy load to mobile service providers. As a key mission in
intelligent networks management, understanding and predicting the distribution
of CDSs benefits many tasks of modern network services such as resource
provisioning and proactive content caching for content delivery networks.
However, the revolutions in novel ubiquitous network architectures led by
ultra-dense networks (UDNs) make the task extremely challenging. Specifically,
conventional methods face the challenges of insufficient spatio precision,
lacking generalizability, and complex multi-feature dependencies of user
requests, making their effectiveness unreliable in CDSs prediction under 5G
UDNs. In this paper, we propose to adopt a series of encoding and sampling
methods to model CDSs of known and unknown areas at a tailored fine-grained
level. Moreover, we design a spatio-temporal-social multi-feature extraction
framework for CDSs hotspots prediction, in which a novel edge-enhanced graph
convolution block is proposed to encode dynamic CDSs networks based on the
social relationships and the spatio features. Besides, we introduce the
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to further capture the temporal dependency.
Extensive performance evaluations with real-world measurement data collected in
two mobile content applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
solution, which can improve the prediction area under the curve (AUC) by 40.5%
compared to the state-of-the-art proposals at a spatio granularity of 76m, with
up to 80% of the unknown areas.

<p class="mathjax">Situational awareness (SA) through encrypted connectivity in modern warfare
is critical to battlefield coordination. Existing solutions provide
infrastructure-less connectivity and situational awareness, but at a high cost,
power consumption, and bulky form factors that limit their utility for tactical
operations. We propose the Beartooth MKII radios as a cost- and
power-effective, handy solution for establishing a situational awareness
overlay. To integrate with military information brokers, such as the Tactical
Assault Kit (TAK), we propose the Beartooth Gateway, which creates an IP
network between Beartooth radios, Gateways, and other TAK-capable devices. We
show that leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)

<p class="mathjax">Common data types like dates, addresses, phone numbers and tables can have
multiple textual representations, and many heavily-used languages, such as SQL,
come in several dialects. These variations can cause data to be misinterpreted,
leading to silent data corruption, failure of data processing systems, or even
security vulnerabilities. Saggitarius is a new language and system designed to
help programmers reason about the format of data, by describing grammatical
domains -- that is, sets of context-free grammars that describe the many
possible representations of a datatype. We describe the design of Saggitarius
via example and provide a relational semantics. We show how Saggitarius may be
used to analyze a data set: given example data, it uses an algorithm based on
semi-ring parsing and MaxSAT to infer which grammar in a given domain best
matches that data. We evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a
benchmark suite of 110 example problems, and we demonstrate that our system
typically returns a satisfying grammar within a few seconds with only a small
number of examples. We also delve deeper into a more extensive case study on
using Saggitarius for CSV dialect detection. Despite being general-purpose, we
find that Saggitarius offers comparable results to hand-tuned, specialized
tools; in the case of CSV, it infers grammars for 84% of benchmarks within 60
seconds, and has comparable accuracy to custom-built dialect detection tools.

<p class="mathjax">Translating images from a source domain to a target domain for learning
target models is one of the most common strategies in domain adaptive semantic
segmentation (DASS). However, existing methods still struggle to preserve
semantically-consistent local details between the original and translated
images. In this work, we present an innovative approach that addresses this
challenge by using source-domain labels as explicit guidance during image
translation. Concretely, we formulate cross-domain image translation as a
denoising diffusion process and utilize a novel Semantic Gradient Guidance
(SGG) method to constrain the translation process, conditioning it on the
pixel-wise source labels. Additionally, a Progressive Translation Learning
(PTL) strategy is devised to enable the SGG method to work reliably across
domains with large gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
our approach over state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the growing availability of face anti-spoofing databases, researchers
are increasingly focusing on video-based methods that use hundreds to thousands
of images to assess their impact on performance. However, there is no clear
consensus on the exact number of frames in a video required to improve the
performance of face anti-spoofing tasks. Inspired by the visual saliency
theory, we present a video summarization method for face anti-spoofing tasks
that aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of deep learning models by
leveraging visual saliency. In particular, saliency information is extracted
from the differences between the Laplacian and Wiener filter outputs of the
source images, enabling identification of the most visually salient regions
within each frame. Subsequently, the source images are decomposed into base and
detail layers, enhancing representation of important information. The weighting
maps are then computed based on the saliency information, indicating the
importance of each pixel in the image. By linearly combining the base and
detail layers using the weighting maps, the method fuses the source images to
create a single representative image that summarizes the entire video. The key
contribution of our proposed method lies in demonstrating how visual saliency
can be used as a data-centric approach to improve the performance and
efficiency of face presentation attack detection models. By focusing on the
most salient images or regions within the images, a more representative and
diverse training set can be created, potentially leading to more effective
models. To validate the method's effectiveness, a simple deep learning
architecture (CNN-RNN) was used, and the experimental results showcased
state-of-the-art performance on five challenging face anti-spoofing datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Learning novel concepts, remembering previous knowledge, and adapting it to
future tasks occur simultaneously throughout a human's lifetime. To model such
comprehensive abilities, continual zero-shot learning (CZSL) has recently been
introduced. However, most existing methods overused unseen semantic information
that may not be continually accessible in realistic settings. In this paper, we
address the challenge of continual zero-shot learning where unseen information
is not provided during training, by leveraging generative modeling. The heart
of the generative-based methods is to learn quality representations from seen
classes to improve the generative understanding of the unseen visual space.
Motivated by this, we introduce generalization-bound tools and provide the
first theoretical explanation for the benefits of generative modeling to CZSL
tasks. Guided by the theoretical analysis, we then propose our learning
algorithm that employs a novel semantically guided Generative Random Walk (GRW)
loss. The GRW loss augments the training by continually encouraging the model
to generate realistic and characterized samples to represent the unseen space.
Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on AWA1, AWA2, CUB, and SUN
datasets, surpassing existing CZSL methods by 3-7\%. The code has been made
available here \url{https://github.com/wx-zhang/IGCZSL}

<p class="mathjax">With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such
as finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely
affected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals
ought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving
their situation and thus receive a favorable decision. Prior work on sequential
algorithmic recourse -- which recommends a series of changes -- focuses on
action feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to determine
action costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the risk of
higher than average costs in recourse have not been considered. It is
undesirable if a recourse could (with some probability) result in a worse
situation from which recovery requires an extremely high cost. It is essential
to incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the
recourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse
(SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on
their risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse
desiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to
compute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect
algorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We
also adopt measures ``Value at Risk'' and ``Conditional Value at Risk'' from
the financial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to
two real-world datasets and compare policies with different levels of
risk-aversion using risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and
proximity).

<p class="mathjax">We present AdVerb, a novel audio-visual dereverberation framework that uses
visual cues in addition to the reverberant sound to estimate clean audio.
Although audio-only dereverberation is a well-studied problem, our approach
incorporates the complementary visual modality to perform audio
dereverberation. Given an image of the environment where the reverberated sound
signal has been recorded, AdVerb employs a novel geometry-aware cross-modal
transformer architecture that captures scene geometry and audio-visual
cross-modal relationship to generate a complex ideal ratio mask, which, when
applied to the reverberant audio predicts the clean sound. The effectiveness of
our method is demonstrated through extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional audio-only and
audio-visual baselines on three downstream tasks: speech enhancement, speech
recognition, and speaker verification, with relative improvements in the range
of 18% - 82% on the LibriSpeech test-clean set. We also achieve highly
satisfactory RT60 error scores on the AVSpeech dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Open-set face recognition refers to a scenario in which biometric systems
have incomplete knowledge of all existing subjects. Therefore, they are
expected to prevent face samples of unregistered subjects from being identified
as previously enrolled identities. This watchlist context adds an arduous
requirement that calls for the dismissal of irrelevant faces by focusing mainly
on subjects of interest. As a response, this work introduces a novel method
that associates an ensemble of compact neural networks with a margin-based cost
function that explores additional samples. Supplementary negative samples can
be obtained from external databases or synthetically built at the
representation level in training time with a new mix-up feature augmentation
approach. Deep neural networks pre-trained on large face datasets serve as the
preliminary feature extraction module. We carry out experiments on well-known
LFW and IJB-C datasets where results show that the approach is able to boost
closed and open-set identification rates.

generalizable task affinities which can be applied to novel tasks and domains.
Integrated into an off-the-shelf vision transformer backbone, our adapters can
simultaneously solve multiple dense vision tasks in a parameter-efficient
manner, unlike existing multitasking transformers that are parametrically
expensive. In contrast to concurrent methods, we do not require retraining or
fine-tuning whenever a new task or domain is added. We introduce a task-adapted
attention mechanism within our adapter framework that combines gradient-based
task similarities with attention-based ones. The learned task affinities
generalize to the following settings: zero-shot task transfer, unsupervised
domain adaptation, and generalization without fine-tuning to novel domains. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms not only the existing convolutional
neural network-based multitasking methods but also the vision transformer-based
ones. Our project page is at \url{https://ivrl.github.io/VTAGML}.

<p class="mathjax">Consider Private Information Retrieval (PIR), where a client wants to
retrieve one file out of $K$ files that are replicated in $N$ different servers
and the client selection must remain private when up to $T$ servers may
collude. Additionally, suppose that the client has noisy side information about
each of the $K$ files, and the side information about a specific file is
obtained by passing this file through one of $D$ possible discrete memoryless
test channels, where $D\le K$. While the statistics of the test channels are
known by the client and by all the servers, the specific mapping
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{M}}$ between the files and the test channels is unknown
to the servers. We study this problem under two different privacy metrics.
Under the first privacy metric, the client wants to preserve the privacy of its
desired file selection and the mapping $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{M}}$. Under the
second privacy metric, the client wants to preserve the privacy of its desired
file and the mapping $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{M}}$, but is willing to reveal the
index of the test channel that is associated to its desired file. For both of
these two privacy metrics, we derive the optimal normalized download cost. Our
problem setup generalizes PIR with colluding servers, PIR with private
noiseless side information, and PIR with private side information under storage
constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic detection of facial Action Units (AUs) allows for objective facial
expression analysis. Due to the high cost of AU labeling and the limited size
of existing benchmarks, previous AU detection methods tend to overfit the
dataset, resulting in a significant performance loss when evaluated across
corpora. To address this problem, we propose FG-Net for generalizable facial
action unit detection. Specifically, FG-Net extracts feature maps from a
StyleGAN2 model pre-trained on a large and diverse face image dataset. Then,
these features are used to detect AUs with a Pyramid CNN Interpreter, making
the training efficient and capturing essential local features. The proposed
FG-Net achieves a strong generalization ability for heatmap-based AU detection
thanks to the generalizable and semantic-rich features extracted from the
pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate
within- and cross-corpus AU detection with the widely-used DISFA and BP4D
datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed method achieves
superior cross-domain performance while maintaining competitive within-domain
performance. In addition, FG-Net is data-efficient and achieves competitive
performance even when trained on 1000 samples. Our code will be released at

<p class="mathjax">A person's gender is a crucial piece of information when performing research
across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology,
political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing
instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information
is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from
readily available information, primarily from persons' names. While inferring
gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable
alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the
goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to
examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of
name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic
approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout
the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental
organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be
systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the
optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale
performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference.
Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We
further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than
any single existing approach.

<p class="mathjax">Image captioning, like many tasks involving vision and language, currently
relies on Transformer-based architectures for extracting the semantics in an
image and translating it into linguistically coherent descriptions. Although
successful, the attention operator only considers a weighted summation of
projections of the current input sample, therefore ignoring the relevant
semantic information which can come from the joint observation of other
samples. In this paper, we devise a network which can perform attention over
activations obtained while processing other training samples, through a
prototypical memory model. Our memory models the distribution of past keys and
values through the definition of prototype vectors which are both
discriminative and compact. Experimentally, we assess the performance of the
proposed model on the COCO dataset, in comparison with carefully designed
baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, and by investigating the role of
each of the proposed components. We demonstrate that our proposal can increase
the performance of an encoder-decoder Transformer by 3.7 CIDEr points both when
training in cross-entropy only and when fine-tuning with self-critical sequence
training. Source code and trained models are available at:

<p class="mathjax">In this article, we study the inconsistency of systems of $\min-\rightarrow$
fuzzy relational equations. We give analytical formulas for computing the
Chebyshev distances $\nabla = \inf_{d \in \mathcal{D}} \Vert \beta - d \Vert$
associated to systems of $\min-\rightarrow$ fuzzy relational equations of the
form $\Gamma \Box_{\rightarrow}^{\min} x = \beta$, where $\rightarrow$ is a
residual implicator among the G\"odel implication $\rightarrow_G$, the Goguen
implication $\rightarrow_{GG}$ or Lukasiewicz's implication $\rightarrow_L$ and
$\mathcal{D}$ is the set of second members of consistent systems defined with
the same matrix $\Gamma$. The main preliminary result that allows us to obtain
these formulas is that the Chebyshev distance $\nabla$ is the lower bound of
the solutions of a vector inequality, whatever the residual implicator used.
Finally, we show that, in the case of the $\min-\rightarrow_{G}$ system, the
Chebyshev distance $\nabla$ may be an infimum, while it is always a minimum for
$\min-\rightarrow_{GG}$ and $\min-\rightarrow_{L}$ systems.

and Processes influence the quality of its Products. We call this the PPP
Theory. Although empirical software engineering research has grown common, it
is unclear whether researchers are trying to evaluate the PPP Theory. To assess
this, we analyzed half (33) of the empirical works published over the last two
years in three prominent software engineering conferences. In this sample, 70%
focus on policies/processes or products, not both. Only 33% provided
measurements relating policy/process and products. We make four
recommendations: (1) Use PPP Theory in study design; (2) Study feedback
relationships; (3) Diversify the studied feedforward relationships; and (4)
Disentangle policy and process. Let us remember that research results are in
the context of, and with respect to, the relationship between software

<p class="mathjax">In data imputation, effectively addressing missing values is pivotal,
especially in intricate datasets. This paper delves into the FIML Optimized
Self-attention (FOSA) framework, an innovative approach that amalgamates the
strengths of Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation with the
capabilities of self-attention neural networks. Our methodology commences with
an initial estimation of missing values via FIML, subsequently refining these
estimates by leveraging the self-attention mechanism. Our comprehensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets underscore FOSA's
pronounced advantages over traditional FIML techniques, encapsulating facets of
accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse data
structures. Intriguingly, even in scenarios where the Structural Equation Model
(SEM) might be mis-specified, leading to suboptimal FIML estimates, the robust
architecture of FOSA's self-attention component adeptly rectifies and optimizes
the imputation outcomes. Our empirical tests reveal that FOSA consistently
delivers commendable predictions, even in the face of up to 40% random
missingness, highlighting its robustness and potential for wide-scale
applications in data imputation.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately estimating parameters in complex nonlinear systems is crucial
across scientific and engineering fields. We present a novel approach for
parameter estimation using a neural network with the Huber loss function. This
method taps into deep learning's abilities to uncover parameters governing
intricate behaviors in nonlinear equations. We validate our approach using
synthetic data and predefined functions that model system dynamics. By training
the neural network with noisy time series data, it fine-tunes the Huber loss
function to converge to accurate parameters. We apply our method to damped
oscillators, Van der Pol oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and Lorenz
systems under multiplicative noise. The trained neural network accurately
estimates parameters, evident from closely matching latent dynamics. Comparing
true and estimated trajectories visually reinforces our method's precision and
robustness. Our study underscores the Huber loss-guided neural network as a
versatile tool for parameter estimation, effectively uncovering complex
relationships in nonlinear systems. The method navigates noise and uncertainty
adeptly, showcasing its adaptability to real-world challenges.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) has led to important breakthroughs in computer
vision by allowing learning from large amounts of unlabeled data. As such, it
might have a pivotal role to play in biomedicine where annotating data requires
a highly specialized expertise. Yet, there are many healthcare domains for
which SSL has not been extensively explored. One such domain is endoscopy,
minimally invasive procedures which are commonly used to detect and treat
infections, chronic inflammatory diseases or cancer. In this work, we study the
use of a leading SSL framework, namely Masked Siamese Networks (MSNs), for
endoscopic video analysis such as colonoscopy and laparoscopy. To fully exploit
the power of SSL, we create sizable unlabeled endoscopic video datasets for
training MSNs. These strong image representations serve as a foundation for
secondary training with limited annotated datasets, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance in endoscopic benchmarks like surgical phase
recognition during laparoscopy and colonoscopic polyp characterization.
Additionally, we achieve a 50% reduction in annotated data size without
sacrificing performance. Thus, our work provides evidence that SSL can
dramatically reduce the need of annotated data in endoscopy.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of \textit{safe control of linear dynamical systems
corrupted with non-stochastic noise}, and provide an algorithm that guarantees
(i) zero constraint violation of convex time-varying constraints, and (ii)
bounded dynamic regret, \ie bounded suboptimality against an optimal
clairvoyant controller that knows the future noise a priori. The constraints
bound the values of the state and of the control input such as to ensure
collision avoidance and bounded control effort. We are motivated by the future
of autonomy where robots will safely perform complex tasks despite real-world
unpredictable disturbances such as wind and wake disturbances. To develop the
algorithm, we capture our problem as a sequential game between a linear
feedback controller and an adversary, assuming a known upper bound on the
noise's magnitude. Particularly, at each step $t=1,\ldots, T$, first the
controller chooses a linear feedback control gain $K_t \in \calK_t$, where
$\calK_t$ is constructed such that it guarantees that the safety constraints
will be satisfied; then, the adversary reveals the current noise $w_t$ and the
controller suffers a loss $f_t(K_t)$ -- \eg $f_t$ represents the system's
tracking error at $t$ upon the realization of the noise. The controller aims to
minimize its cumulative loss, despite knowing $w_t$ only after $K_t$ has been
chosen. We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of safe control of
linear dynamical systems in the presence of bounded noise

This is the first paper entirely generated with outputs from ChatGPT. We

ChatGPT successfully simulates the creation of a new improved model, called
GPT$^4$, which combines the concepts of GPT in AI (generative pretrained

that GPT$^4$ can use its built-in mathematical and statistical capabilities to
simulate and analyze physical laws and phenomena. As a demonstration of its

our results demonstrate the promising potential for human-AI collaboration in

challenging task that is accomplished today primarily through physical
techniques known as Foley art. Foley artists create sounds with common objects
(e.g., boxing gloves, broken glass) in time with video as it is playing to
generate captivating audio tracks. In this work, we aim to develop a
deep-learning based framework that does much the same - observes video in it's
natural sequence and generates realistic audio to accompany it. Notably, we
have reason to believe this is achievable due to advancements in realistic
audio generation techniques conditioned on other inputs (e.g., Wavenet
conditioned on text). We explore several different model architectures to
accomplish this task that process both previously-generated audio and video
context. These include deep-fusion CNN, dilated Wavenet CNN with visual

transformer-based architecture yields the most promising results, matching
low-frequencies to visual patterns effectively, but failing to generate more
nuanced waveforms.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligence is a human construct to represent the ability to achieve goals.
Given this wide berth, intelligence has been defined countless times, studied
in a variety of ways and quantified using numerous measures. Understanding
intelligence ultimately requires theory and quantification, both of which are
elusive. My main objectives are to identify some of the central elements in and
surrounding intelligence, discuss some of its challenges and propose a theory
based on first principles. I focus on intelligence as defined by and for
humans, frequently in comparison to machines, with the intention of setting the
stage for more general characterizations in life, collectives, human designs
such as AI and in non-designed physical and chemical systems. I discuss key
features of intelligence, including path efficiency and goal accuracy,
intelligence as a Black Box, environmental influences, flexibility to deal with
surprisal, the regress of intelligence, the relativistic nature of intelligence
and difficulty, and temporal changes in intelligence including its evolution. I
present a framework for a first principles Theory of IntelligenceS (TIS), based
on the quantifiable macro-scale system features of difficulty, surprisal and
goal resolution accuracy. The proposed partitioning of uncertainty/solving and
accuracy/understanding is particularly novel since it predicts that paths to a
goal not only function to accurately achieve goals, but as experimentations
leading to higher probabilities for future attainable goals and increased
breadth to enter new goal spaces. TIS can therefore explain endeavors that do
not necessarily affect Darwinian fitness, such as leisure, politics, games and
art. I conclude with several conceptual advances of TIS including a compact
mathematical form of surprisal and difficulty, the theoretical basis of TIS,
and open questions.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most common solutions adopted by software researchers to address
code generation is by training Large Language Models (LLMs) on massive amounts
of source code. Although a number of studies have shown that LLMs have been
effectively evaluated on popular accuracy metrics (e.g., BLEU, CodeBleu),
previous research has largely overlooked the role of Causal Inference as a
fundamental component of the interpretability of LLMs' performance. Existing
benchmarks and datasets are meant to highlight the difference between the
expected and the generated outcome, but do not take into account confounding
variables (e.g., lines of code, prompt size) that equally influence the
accuracy metrics. The fact remains that, when dealing with generative software
tasks by LLMs, no benchmark is available to tell researchers how to quantify
neither the causal effect of SE-based treatments nor the correlation of
confounders to the model's performance. In an effort to bring statistical rigor
to the evaluation of LLMs, this paper introduces a benchmarking strategy named
Galeras comprised of curated testbeds for three SE tasks (i.e., code
completion, code summarization, and commit generation) to help aid the
interpretation of LLMs' performance. We illustrate the insights of our
benchmarking strategy by conducting a case study on the performance of ChatGPT
under distinct prompt engineering methods. The results of the case study
demonstrate the positive causal influence of prompt semantics on ChatGPT's
generative performance by an average treatment effect of $\approx 3\%$.
Moreover, it was found that confounders such as prompt size are highly
correlated with accuracy metrics ($\approx 0.412\%$). The end result of our
case study is to showcase causal inference evaluations, in practice, to reduce
confounding bias. By reducing the bias, we offer an interpretable solution for
the accuracy metric under analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Smart homes are powered by numerous programmable IoT platforms. Despite
tremendous innovations, these platforms often suffer from safety and security
issues. One class of defense solutions dynamically enforces safety and security
policies, which essentially capture the expected behavior of the IoT system.
While many proposed works were built on this runtime approach, they all are
under-vetted. The primary reason lies in their evaluation approach. They are
mostly self-evaluated in isolation using a virtual testbed combined with
manually orchestrated test scenarios that rely on user interactions with the
platform's UI. Such hand-crafted and non-uniform evaluation setups are limiting
not only the reproducibility but also a comparative analysis of their efficacy
results. Closing this gap in the traditional way requires a huge upfront manual
effort, which causes the researchers turn away from any large-scale comparative
empirical evaluation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a highly-automated
uniform evaluation platform, dubbed VetIoT, to vet the defense solutions that
hinge on runtime policy enforcement. Given a defense solution, VetIoT easily
instantiates a virtual testbed inside which the solution is empirically
evaluated. VetIoT replaces manual UI-based interactions with an automated event
simulator and manual inspection of test outcomes with an automated comparator.
We developed a fully-functional prototype of VetIoT and applied it on three
runtime policy enforcement solutions: Expat, Patriot, and IoTguard. VetIoT
reproduced their individual prior results and assessed their efficacy results
via stress testing and differential testing. We believe VetIoT can foster
future research/evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">We present novel, tight, convex relaxations for rotation and pose estimation
problems that can guarantee global optimality via strong Lagrangian duality.
Some such relaxations exist in the literature for specific problem setups that
assume the matrix von Mises-Fisher distribution (a.k.a., matrix Langevin
distribution or chordal distance) for isotropic rotational uncertainty.
However, another common way to represent uncertainty for rotations and poses is
to define anisotropic noise in the associated Lie algebra. Starting from a
noise model based on the Cayley map, we define our estimation problems, convert
them to Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQPs), then relax them
to Semidefinite Programs (SDPs), which can be solved using standard
interior-point optimization methods. We first show how to carry out basic
rotation and pose averaging. We then turn to the more complex problem of
trajectory estimation, which involves many pose variables with both individual
and inter-pose measurements (or motion priors). Our contribution is to
formulate SDP relaxations for all these problems, including the identification
of sufficient redundant constraints to make them tight. We hope our results can
add to the catalogue of useful estimation problems whose global optimality can
be guaranteed.

<p class="mathjax">Sign language, which conveys meaning through gestures, is the chief means of
communication among deaf people. Recognizing sign language in natural settings
presents significant challenges due to factors such as lighting, background
clutter, and variations in signer characteristics. In this thesis, I study
automatic sign language processing in the wild, using signing videos collected
from the Internet. This thesis contributes new datasets, tasks, and methods.
Most chapters of this thesis address tasks related to fingerspelling, an
important component of sign language and yet has not been studied widely by
prior work. I present three new large-scale ASL datasets in the wild:
ChicagoFSWild, ChicagoFSWild+, and OpenASL. Using ChicagoFSWild and
ChicagoFSWild+, I address fingerspelling recognition, which consists of
transcribing fingerspelling sequences into text. I propose an end-to-end
approach based on iterative attention that allows recognition from a raw video
without explicit hand detection. I further show that using a Conformer-based
network jointly modeling handshape and mouthing can bring performance close to
that of humans. Next, I propose two tasks for building real-world
fingerspelling-based applications: fingerspelling detection and search. For
fingerspelling detection, I introduce a suite of evaluation metrics and a new
detection model via multi-task training. To address the problem of searching
for fingerspelled keywords in raw sign language videos, we propose a novel
method that jointly localizes and matches fingerspelling segments to text.
Finally, I will describe a benchmark for large-vocabulary open-domain sign
language translation based on OpenASL. To address the challenges of sign
language translation in realistic settings, we propose a set of techniques
including sign search as a pretext task for pre-training and fusion of mouthing
and handshape features.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have rapidly evolved, necessitating
comprehensive insights into their diverse components. However, a systematic
literature review that emphasizes the Environmental, Sustainability, and
Governance (ESG) components of DLT remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we
selected 107 seed papers to build a citation network of 63,083 references and
refined it to a corpus of 24,539 publications for analysis. Then, we labeled
the named entities in 46 papers according to twelve top-level categories
derived from an established technology taxonomy and enhanced the taxonomy by
pinpointing DLT's ESG elements. Leveraging transformer-based language models,
we fine-tuned a pre-trained language model for a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
task using our labeled dataset. We used our fine-tuned language model to
distill the corpus to 505 key papers, facilitating a literature review via
named entities and temporal graph analysis on DLT evolution in the context of
ESG. Our contributions are a methodology to conduct a machine learning-driven
systematic literature review in the DLT field, placing a special emphasis on
ESG aspects. Furthermore, we present a first-of-its-kind NER dataset, composed
of 54,808 named entities, designed for DLT and ESG-related explorations.

<p class="mathjax">We develop a methodology to create data-driven predictive digital twins for
optimal risk-aware clinical decision-making. We illustrate the methodology as
an enabler for an anticipatory personalized treatment that accounts for
uncertainties in the underlying tumor biology in high-grade gliomas, where
heterogeneity in the response to standard-of-care (SOC) radiotherapy
contributes to sub-optimal patient outcomes. The digital twin is initialized
through prior distributions derived from population-level clinical data in the
literature for a mechanistic model's parameters. Then the digital twin is
personalized using Bayesian model calibration for assimilating patient-specific
magnetic resonance imaging data and used to propose optimal radiotherapy
treatment regimens by solving a multi-objective risk-based optimization under
uncertainty problem. The solution leads to a suite of patient-specific optimal
radiotherapy treatment regimens exhibiting varying levels of trade-off between
the two competing clinical objectives: (i) maximizing tumor control
(characterized by minimizing the risk of tumor volume growth) and (ii)
minimizing the toxicity from radiotherapy. The proposed digital twin framework
is illustrated by generating an in silico cohort of 100 patients with
high-grade glioma growth and response properties typically observed in the
literature. For the same total radiation dose as the SOC, the personalized
treatment regimens lead to median increase in tumor time to progression of
around six days. Alternatively, for the same level of tumor control as the SOC,
the digital twin provides optimal treatment options that lead to a median
reduction in radiation dose by 16.7% (10 Gy) compared to SOC total dose of 60
Gy. The range of optimal solutions also provide options with increased doses
for patients with aggressive cancer, where SOC does not lead to sufficient
tumor control.

<p class="mathjax">A thorough analysis of wheel-terrain interaction is critical to ensure the
safe and efficient operation of space rovers on extraterrestrial surfaces like
the Moon or Mars. This paper presents an approach for developing and
experimentally validating a virtual wheel-terrain interaction model for the UAE
Rashid rover. The model aims to improve the fidelity and capability of current
simulation methods for space rovers and facilitate the design, evaluation, and
control of their locomotion systems. The proposed method considers various
factors, such as wheel grouser properties, wheel slippage, loose soil
properties, and interaction mechanics. The model accuracy was validated through
experiments on a Test-rig testbed that simulated lunar soil conditions. In
specific, a set of experiments was carried out to test the behaviors acted on a
Grouser-Rashid rover wheel by the lunar soil with different slip ratios of 0,
0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed
simulation method provides a more accurate and realistic simulation of the
wheel-terrain interaction behavior and provides insight into the overall
performance of the rover

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of unsupervised semantic segmentation of outdoor LiDAR
point clouds in diverse traffic scenarios. The key idea is to leverage the
spatiotemporal nature of a dynamic point cloud sequence and introduce
drastically stronger augmentation by establishing spatiotemporal
correspondences across multiple frames. We dovetail clustering and pseudo-label
learning in this work. Essentially, we alternate between clustering points into
semantic groups and optimizing models using point-wise pseudo-spatiotemporal
labels with a simple learning objective. Therefore, our method can learn
discriminative features in an unsupervised learning fashion. We show promising
segmentation performance on Semantic-KITTI, SemanticPOSS, and FLORIDA benchmark
datasets covering scenarios in autonomous vehicle and intersection
infrastructure, which is competitive when compared against many existing fully
supervised learning methods. This general framework can lead to a unified
representation learning approach for LiDAR point clouds incorporating domain
knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have yielded promising results for both
recognizing objects in challenging conditions and modeling aspects of primate
vision. However, the representational dynamics of recurrent computations remain
poorly understood, especially in large-scale visual models. Here, we studied
such dynamics in RNNs trained for object classification on MiniEcoset, a novel
subset of ecoset. We report two main insights. First, upon inference,
representations continued to evolve after correct classification, suggesting a
lack of the notion of being ``done with classification''. Second, focusing on
``readout zones'' as a way to characterize the activation trajectories, we
observe that misclassified representations exhibit activation patterns with
lower L2 norm, and are positioned more peripherally in the readout zones. Such
arrangements help the misclassified representations move into the correct zones
as time progresses. Our findings generalize to networks with lateral and
top-down connections, and include both additive and multiplicative interactions
with the bottom-up sweep. The results therefore contribute to a general
understanding of RNN dynamics in naturalistic tasks. We hope that the analysis
framework will aid future investigations of other types of RNNs, including
understanding of representational dynamics in primate vision.

(e.g., address uniqueness and aggregatability) and policy (e.g., contact
information and IP scarcity) requirements unique to their region. While
different RIRs have different policies for out-of-region address use, little
prior systematic analysis has studied where addresses are used post-allocation.
<br />In this preliminary work, we e IPv4 prefix registrations across the five RIRs
(50k total prefixes) and utilize the Atlas distributed active measurement
infrastructure to geolocate prefixes at RIR-region granularity. We define a
taxonomy of registration ``geo-consistency'' by comparing a prefixes' inferred
physical location to the allocating RIR's coverage region as well as the
registered organization's location. We then apply this methodology and taxonomy
to audit the geo-consistency of 10k random IPv4 prefix allocations within each
RIR (50k total prefixes). While we find registry information to largely be
consistent with our geolocation inferences, we show that some RIRs have a
non-trivial fraction of prefixes that are used both outside of the RIR's region
and outside of the registered organization's region. A better understanding of
such discrepancies can increase transparency for the community and inform
ongoing discussions over in-region address use and policy.

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), leveraging Deep Learning (DL) in
reinforcement learning, has shown significant potential in achieving
human-level autonomy in a wide range of domains, including robotics, computer
vision, and computer games. This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing
interest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently
focuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention
devoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on
Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&amp;A forum for developers, to uncover and
understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems.
Specifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms:
server/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering
and manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment,
investigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to
deploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of
these challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is
growing, confirming the study's relevance and importance. Results also show
that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we
built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different
platforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most
popular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among
practitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the
community overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face
when deploying DRL systems.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel defense, against backdoor attacks on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors)
into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses
that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense
is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract
backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.
The approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small
set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal
functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus
resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize
backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the
feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter
out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an
ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert
(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 16 SOTA
backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of
BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet)
across various model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2 and Vision
Transformer).

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is increasingly applied in large-scale
productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL
systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which
often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)
is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to
the environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable
magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original
state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive
CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from
inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing
approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately
erases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the
adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL
algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted
environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and
fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully
helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by
vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained
rewards for drifted environments that are resolved by both approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have recently produced outstanding
results in learning visual representations from unlabeled videos. Despite the
importance of motion in supervised learning techniques for action recognition,
SSL methods often do not explicitly consider motion information in videos. To
address this issue, we propose MOFO (MOtion FOcused), a novel SSL method for
focusing representation learning on the motion area of a video, for action
recognition. MOFO automatically detects motion areas in videos and uses these
to guide the self-supervision task. We use a masked autoencoder which randomly
masks out a high proportion of the input sequence; we force a specified
percentage of the inside of the motion area to be masked and the remainder from
outside. We further incorporate motion information into the finetuning step to
emphasise motion in the downstream task. We demonstrate that our motion-focused
innovations can significantly boost the performance of the currently leading
SSL method (VideoMAE) for action recognition. Our method improves the recent
self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT), VideoMAE, by achieving +2.6%, +2.1%,
+1.3% accuracy on Epic-Kitchens verb, noun and action classification,
respectively, and +4.7% accuracy on Something-Something V2 action
classification. Our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of
the current SSL method for action recognition, indicating the importance of
explicitly encoding motion in SSL.

<p class="mathjax">Technological advancements have revolutionized various aspects of human life,
facilitating communication, business operations, healthcare, education, and
environmental monitoring. However, this increased reliance on technology has
also led to a surge in cybercrime, including cyber scams. The "419 scam" or
Nigerian scam has been a persistent problem for decades, encompassing frauds
like advance fee scams, fake lotteries, and black money scams. Initially
prevalent through postal mail and later via fax, the scam has now transitioned
to email. This study aims to identify recent types of 419 scam emails,
particularly after the covid 19 pandemic, and explore commonly used email
subjects. Analysis of the sample 419 scam emails revealed trending scams like
lucky winner, threat of exposure, business/partnership proposals, investment,
cancer/long-term illness, fund, and compensation scams. Emerging scams included
COVID-related, cryptocurrency, marketing contact, and software development
scams. Irrespective of the scam type, scammers commonly employed email subjects
such as 'Re', 'Good day', 'Greetings', 'Dear friend', 'Confirm', 'Attention',
and 'Hello dear'. The severity of cybercrime, especially the 419 scams, cannot
be overstated, as it erodes trust, causes financial losses, and hampers
Nigeria's reputation and economic progress. Combatting cyber scams and
enhancing cybersecurity measures are crucial to protect individuals and
organizations from falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.

<p class="mathjax">The radiance fields style transfer is an emerging field that has recently
gained popularity as a means of 3D scene stylization, thanks to the outstanding
performance of neural radiance fields in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis.
We highlight a research gap in radiance fields style transfer, the lack of
sufficient perceptual controllability, motivated by the existing concept in the
2D image style transfer. In this paper, we present ARF-Plus, a 3D neural style
transfer framework offering manageable control over perceptual factors, to
systematically explore the perceptual controllability in 3D scene stylization.
Four distinct types of controls - color preservation control, (style pattern)
scale control, spatial (selective stylization area) control, and depth
enhancement control - are proposed and integrated into this framework. Results
from real-world datasets, both quantitative and qualitative, show that the four
types of controls in our ARF-Plus framework successfully accomplish their
corresponding perceptual controls when stylizing 3D scenes. These techniques
work well for individual style inputs as well as for the simultaneous
application of multiple styles within a scene. This unlocks a realm of
limitless possibilities, allowing customized modifications of stylization
effects and flexible merging of the strengths of different styles, ultimately
enabling the creation of novel and eye-catching stylistic effects on 3D scenes.

<p class="mathjax">While hundreds of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now approved or
cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), many studies have shown
inconsistent generalization or latent bias, particularly for underrepresented
populations. Some have proposed that generative AI could reduce the need for
real data, but its utility in model development remains unclear. Skin disease
serves as a useful case study in synthetic image generation due to the
diversity of disease appearance, particularly across the protected attribute of
skin tone. Here we show that latent diffusion models can scalably generate
images of skin disease and that augmenting model training with these data
improves performance in data-limited settings. These performance gains saturate
at synthetic-to-real image ratios above 10:1 and are substantially smaller than
the gains obtained from adding real images. As part of our analysis, we
generate and analyze a new dataset of 458,920 synthetic images produced using
several generation strategies. Our results suggest that synthetic data could
serve as a force-multiplier for model development, but the collection of
diverse real-world data remains the most important step to improve medical AI
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances of generative learning models are accompanied by the growing
interest in federated learning (FL) based on generative adversarial network
(GAN) models. In the context of FL, GAN can capture the underlying client data
structure, and regenerate samples resembling the original data distribution
without compromising the private raw data. Although most existing GAN-based FL
works focus on training a global model, Personalized FL (PFL) sometimes can be
more effective in view of client data heterogeneity in terms of distinct data
sample distributions, feature spaces, and labels. To cope with client
heterogeneity in GAN-based FL, we propose a novel GAN sharing and aggregation
strategy for PFL. The proposed PFL-GAN addresses the client heterogeneity in
different scenarios. More specially, we first learn the similarity among
clients and then develop an weighted collaborative data aggregation. The
empirical results through the rigorous experimentation on several well-known
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PFL-GAN.

teams to swiftly adjust to the market need and demand. To address these
challenges, product management teams have had to adapt their approach to
software development, reshaping their processes to meet the demands of the
pandemic. Brighsquid implemented a new task assignment process aimed at
enhancing developer accountability toward the customer. To assess the impact of
this change on code ownership, we conducted a code change analysis.
Additionally, we surveyed 67 developers to investigate the relationship between
accountability and ownership more broadly. The findings of our case study
indicate that the revised assignment model not only increased the perceived
sense of accountability within the production team but also improved code
resilience against ownership changes. Moreover, the survey results revealed
that a majority of the participating developers (67.5%) associated perceived

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models encompass an extensive knowledge base and offer remarkable
transferability. However, this knowledge becomes outdated or insufficient over
time. The challenge lies in updating foundation models to accommodate novel
information while retaining their original ability. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to achieving continual model updates by effecting localized
modifications to a small subset of parameters. Guided by insights gleaned from
prior analyses of foundational models, we first localize a specific layer for
model refinement and then introduce an importance scoring mechanism designed to
update only the most crucial weights. Our method is exhaustively evaluated on
foundational vision-language models, measuring its efficacy in both learning
new information and preserving pre-established knowledge across a diverse
spectrum of continual learning tasks, including Aircraft, Birdsnap CIFAR-100,
CUB, Cars, and GTSRB. The results show that our method improves the existing
continual learning methods by 0.5\% - 10\% on average, and reduces the loss of

<p class="mathjax">Since the introduction of ChatGPT and GPT-4, these models have been tested
across a large number of tasks. Their adeptness across domains is evident, but
their aptitude in playing games and specifically their aptitude in the realm of
poker has remained unexplored. Poker is a game that requires decision making
under uncertainty and incomplete information. In this paper, we put ChatGPT and
GPT-4 through the poker test and evaluate their poker skills. Our findings
reveal that while both models display an advanced understanding of poker,
encompassing concepts like the valuation of starting hands, playing positions
and other intricacies of game theory optimal (GTO) poker, both ChatGPT and
GPT-4 are NOT game theory optimal poker players.
<br />Through a series of experiments, we first discover the characteristics of
optimal prompts and model parameters for playing poker with these models. Our
observations then unveil the distinct playing personas of the two models. We
first conclude that GPT-4 is a more advanced poker player than ChatGPT. This
exploration then sheds light on the divergent poker tactics of the two models:
ChatGPT's conservativeness juxtaposed against GPT-4's aggression. In poker
vernacular, when tasked to play GTO poker, ChatGPT plays like a Nit, which
means that it has a propensity to only engage with premium hands and folds a
majority of hands. When subjected to the same directive, GPT-4 plays like a
maniac, showcasing a loose and aggressive style of play. Both strategies,
although relatively advanced, are not game theory optimal.

<p class="mathjax">Producing quality segmentation masks for images is a fundamental problem in
computer vision. Recent research has explored large-scale supervised training
to enable zero-shot segmentation on virtually any image style and unsupervised
training to enable segmentation without dense annotations. However,
constructing a model capable of segmenting anything in a zero-shot manner
without any annotations is still challenging. In this paper, we propose to
utilize the self-attention layers in stable diffusion models to achieve this
goal because the pre-trained stable diffusion model has learned inherent
concepts of objects within its attention layers. Specifically, we introduce a
simple yet effective iterative merging process based on measuring KL divergence
among attention maps to merge them into valid segmentation masks. The proposed
method does not require any training or language dependency to extract quality
segmentation for any images. On COCO-Stuff-27, our method surpasses the prior
unsupervised zero-shot SOTA method by an absolute 26% in pixel accuracy and 17%
in mean IoU.

<p class="mathjax">Change blindness is a phenomenon where an individual fails to notice
alterations in a visual scene when a change occurs during a brief interruption
or distraction. Understanding this phenomenon is specifically important for the
technique that uses a visual stimulus, such as Virtual Reality (VR) or
Augmented Reality (AR). Previous research had primarily focused on 2D
environments or conducted limited controlled experiments in 3D immersive
environments. In this paper, we design and conduct two formal user experiments
to investigate the effects of different visual attention-disrupting conditions
(Flickering and Head-Turning) and object alternative conditions (Removal, Color
Alteration, and Size Alteration) on change blindness detection in VR and AR
environments. Our results reveal that participants detected changes more
quickly and had a higher detection rate with Flickering compared to
Head-Turning. Furthermore, they spent less time detecting changes when an
object disappeared compared to changes in color or size. Additionally, we
provide a comparison of the results between VR and AR environments.

<p class="mathjax">Existing full text datasets of U.S. public domain newspapers do not recognize
the often complex layouts of newspaper scans, and as a result the digitized
content scrambles texts from articles, headlines, captions, advertisements, and
other layout regions. OCR quality can also be low. This study develops a novel,
deep learning pipeline for extracting full article texts from newspaper images
and applies it to the nearly 20 million scans in Library of Congress's public
domain Chronicling America collection. The pipeline includes layout detection,
legibility classification, custom OCR, and association of article texts
spanning multiple bounding boxes. To achieve high scalability, it is built with
efficient architectures designed for mobile phones. The resulting American
Stories dataset provides high quality data that could be used for pre-training
a large language model to achieve better understanding of historical English
and historical world knowledge. The dataset could also be added to the external
database of a retrieval-augmented language model to make historical information
- ranging from interpretations of political events to minutiae about the lives
of people's ancestors - more widely accessible. Furthermore, structured article
texts facilitate using transformer-based methods for popular social science
applications like topic classification, detection of reproduced content, and
news story clustering. Finally, American Stories provides a massive silver
quality dataset for innovating multimodal layout analysis models and other
multimodal applications.

<p class="mathjax">Depression, a common mental disorder, significantly influences individuals
and imposes considerable societal impacts. The complexity and heterogeneity of
the disorder necessitate prompt and effective detection, which nonetheless,
poses a difficult challenge. This situation highlights an urgent requirement
for improved detection methods. Exploiting auditory data through advanced
machine learning paradigms presents promising research directions. Yet,
existing techniques mainly rely on single-dimensional feature models,
potentially neglecting the abundance of information hidden in various speech
characteristics. To rectify this, we present the novel Attention-Based Acoustic
Feature Fusion Network (ABAFnet) for depression detection. ABAFnet combines
four different acoustic features into a comprehensive deep learning model,
thereby effectively integrating and blending multi-tiered features. We present
a novel weight adjustment module for late fusion that boosts performance by
efficaciously synthesizing these features. The effectiveness of our approach is
confirmed via extensive validation on two clinical speech databases, CNRAC and
CS-NRAC, thereby outperforming previous methods in depression detection and
subtype classification. Further in-depth analysis confirms the key role of each
feature and highlights the importance of MFCCrelated features in speech-based
depression detection.

<p class="mathjax">Dashboards are vital in modern business intelligence tools, providing
non-technical users with an interface to access comprehensive business data.
With the rise of cloud technology, there is an increased number of data sources
to provide enriched contexts for various analytical tasks, leading to a demand
for interactive dashboards over a large number of joins. Nevertheless, joins
are among the most expensive operations in DBMSes, making the support of
interactive dashboards over joins challenging.
<br />In this paper, we present Treant, a dashboard accelerator for queries over
large joins. Treant uses factorized query execution to handle aggregation
queries over large joins, which alone is still insufficient for interactive
speeds. To address this, we exploit the incremental nature of user interactions
using Calibrated Junction Hypertree (CJT), a novel data structure that applies
lightweight materialization of the intermediates during factorized execution.
CJT ensures that the work needed to compute a query is proportional to how
different it is from the previous query, rather than the overall complexity.
Treant manages CJTs to share work between queries and performs materialization
offline or during user "think-times." Implemented as a middleware that rewrites
SQL, Treant is portable to any SQL-based DBMS. Our experiments on single node
and cloud DBMSes show that Treant improves dashboard interactions by two orders
of magnitude, and provides 10x improvement for ML augmentation compared to SOTA
factorized ML system.

<p class="mathjax">The Kadison-Singer Conjecture, as proved by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava
(MSS) [Ann. Math. 182, 327-350 (2015)], has been informally thought of as a
strengthening of Batson, Spielman, and Srivastava's theorem that every
undirected graph has a linear-sized spectral sparsifier [SICOMP 41, 1704-1721
(2012)]. We formalize this intuition by using a corollary of the MSS result to
derive the existence of spectral sparsifiers with a number of edges linear in
its number of vertices for all undirected, weighted graphs. The proof consists
of two steps. First, following a suggestion of Srivastava [Asia Pac. Math.
Newsl. 3, 15-20 (2013)], we show the result in the special case of graphs with
bounded leverage scores by repeatedly applying the MSS corollary to partition
the graph, while maintaining an appropriate bound on the leverage scores of
each subgraph. Then, we extend to the general case by constructing a recursive
algorithm that repeatedly (i) divides edges with high leverage scores into
multiple parallel edges and (ii) uses the bounded leverage score case to
sparsify the resulting graph.

<p class="mathjax">We study scaling convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically targeting
Residual neural networks (ResNet), for analyzing electrocardiograms (ECGs).
Although ECG signals are time-series data, CNN-based models have been shown to
outperform other neural networks with different architectures in ECG analysis.
However, most previous studies in ECG analysis have overlooked the importance
of network scaling optimization, which significantly improves performance. We
explored and demonstrated an efficient approach to scale ResNet by examining
the effects of crucial parameters, including layer depth, the number of
channels, and the convolution kernel size. Through extensive experiments, we
found that a shallower network, a larger number of channels, and smaller kernel
sizes result in better performance for ECG classifications. The optimal network
scale might differ depending on the target task, but our findings provide
insight into obtaining more efficient and accurate models with fewer computing
resources or less time. In practice, we demonstrate that a narrower search
space based on our findings leads to higher performance.

<p class="mathjax">Image restoration aims to restore high-quality images from degraded
counterparts and has seen significant advancements through deep learning
techniques. The technique has been widely applied to mobile devices for tasks
such as mobile photography. Given the resource limitations on mobile devices,
such as memory constraints and runtime requirements, the efficiency of models
during deployment becomes paramount. Nevertheless, most previous works have
primarily concentrated on analyzing the efficiency of single modules and
improving them individually. This paper examines the efficiency across
different layers. We propose a roadmap that can be applied to further
accelerate image restoration models prior to deployment while simultaneously
increasing PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity
Index). The roadmap first increases the model capacity by adding more
parameters to partial convolutions on FLOPs non-sensitive layers. Then, it
applies partial depthwise convolution coupled with decoupling
upsampling/downsampling layers to accelerate the model speed. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach decreases runtime by up to 13% and
reduces the number of parameters by up to 23%, while increasing PSNR and SSIM
on several image restoration datasets. Source Code of our method is available

<p class="mathjax">Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is increasingly employed in multi-site
research to aid neurological disorder analysis. Existing studies usually suffer
from significant cross-site/domain data heterogeneity caused by site effects
such as differences in scanners/protocols. Many methods have been proposed to
reduce fMRI heterogeneity between source and target domains, heavily relying on
the availability of source data. But acquiring source data is challenging due
to privacy concerns and/or data storage burdens in multi-site studies. To this
end, we design a source-free collaborative domain adaptation (SCDA) framework
for fMRI analysis, where only a pretrained source model and unlabeled target
data are accessible. Specifically, a multi-perspective feature enrichment
method (MFE) is developed for target fMRI analysis, consisting of multiple
collaborative branches to dynamically capture fMRI features of unlabeled target
data from multiple views. Each branch has a data-feeding module, a
spatiotemporal feature encoder, and a class predictor. A mutual-consistency
constraint is designed to encourage pair-wise consistency of latent features of
the same input generated from these branches for robust representation
learning. To facilitate efficient cross-domain knowledge transfer without
source data, we initialize MFE using parameters of a pretrained source model.
We also introduce an unsupervised pretraining strategy using 3,806 unlabeled
fMRIs from three large-scale auxiliary databases, aiming to obtain a general
feature encoder. Experimental results on three public datasets and one private
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our method in cross-scanner and cross-study
prediction tasks. The model pretrained on large-scale rs-fMRI data has been
released to the public.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid spread of false information and persistent manipulation attacks on
online social networks (OSNs), often for political, ideological, or financial
gain, has affected the openness of OSNs. While researchers from various
disciplines have investigated different manipulation-triggering elements of
OSNs (such as understanding information diffusion on OSNs or detecting
automated behavior of accounts), these works have not been consolidated to
present a comprehensive overview of the interconnections among these elements.
Notably, user psychology, the prevalence of bots, and their tactics in relation
to false information detection have been overlooked in previous research. To
address this research gap, this paper synthesizes insights from various
disciplines to provide a comprehensive analysis of the manipulation landscape.
By integrating the primary elements of social media manipulation (SMM),
including false information, bots, and malicious campaigns, we extensively
examine each SMM element. Through a systematic investigation of prior research,
we identify commonalities, highlight existing gaps, and extract valuable
insights in the field. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
interdisciplinary research to effectively combat social media manipulations,
and our systematization can guide future research efforts and assist OSN
providers in ensuring the safety and integrity of their platforms.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely used in skeleton-based
human action recognition. In GCN-based methods, the spatio-temporal graph is
fundamental for capturing motion patterns. However, existing approaches ignore
the physical dependency and synchronized spatio-temporal correlations between
joints, which limits the representation capability of GCNs. To solve these
problems, we construct the directed diffusion graph for action modeling and
introduce the activity partition strategy to optimize the weight sharing
mechanism of graph convolution kernels. In addition, we present the
spatio-temporal synchronization encoder to embed synchronized spatio-temporal
semantics. Finally, we propose Directed Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network
(DD-GCN) for action recognition, and the experiments on three public datasets:
NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA, demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

<p class="mathjax">To protect users' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated
unlearning aims at eliminating the impact of leaving users' data on the global
learned model. The current research in federated unlearning mainly concentrated
on developing effective and efficient unlearning techniques. However, the issue
of incentivizing valuable users to remain engaged and preventing their data
from being unlearned is still under-explored, yet important to the unlearned
model performance. This paper focuses on the incentive issue and develops an
incentive mechanism for federated learning and unlearning. We first
characterize the leaving users' impact on the global model accuracy and the
required communication rounds for unlearning. Building on these results, we
propose a four-stage game to capture the interaction and information updates
during the learning and unlearning process. A key contribution is to summarize
users' multi-dimensional private information into one-dimensional metrics to
guide the incentive design. We show that users who incur high costs and
experience significant training losses are more likely to discontinue their
engagement through federated unlearning. The server tends to retain users who
make substantial contributions to the model but has a trade-off on users'
training losses, as large training losses of retained users increase privacy
costs but decrease unlearning costs. The numerical results demonstrate the
necessity of unlearning incentives for retaining valuable leaving users, and
also show that our proposed mechanisms decrease the server's cost by up to
53.91% compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
agents based on LLMs have shown the potential to address domain-specific tasks
and emulate human behaviors. However, the content generated by these agents
remains somewhat superficial, owing to their limited domain expertise and the
absence of an effective cognitive architecture. To address this, we present the
Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction (CGMI) framework, designed to
replicate human interactions in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose
a tree-structured methodology for the assignment, detection, and maintenance of
agent personality. Additionally, we designed a cognitive architecture equipped
with a skill library based on the ACT* model, which contains memory,
reflection, and planning modules. We have also integrated general agents to
augment the virtual environment's realism. Using the CGMI framework, we
simulated numerous classroom interactions between teacher and students. The
experiments indicate that aspects such as the teaching methodology, curriculum,
and student performance closely mirror real classroom settings. We will open

<p class="mathjax">Vision-and-language pre-training (VLP) models have experienced a surge in
popularity recently. By fine-tuning them on specific datasets, significant
performance improvements have been observed in various tasks. However, full
fine-tuning of VLP models not only consumes a significant amount of
computational resources but also has a significant environmental impact.
Moreover, as remote sensing (RS) data is constantly being updated, full
fine-tuning may not be practical for real-world applications. To address this
issue, in this work, we investigate the parameter-efficient transfer learning
(PETL) method to effectively and efficiently transfer visual-language knowledge
from the natural domain to the RS domain on the image-text retrieval task. To
this end, we make the following contributions. 1) We construct a novel and
sophisticated PETL framework for the RS image-text retrieval (RSITR) task,
which includes the pretrained CLIP model, a multimodal remote sensing adapter,
and a hybrid multi-modal contrastive (HMMC) learning objective; 2) To deal with
the problem of high intra-modal similarity in RS data, we design a simple yet
effective HMMC loss; 3) We provide comprehensive empirical studies for
PETL-based RS image-text retrieval. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
method is promising and of great potential for practical applications. 4) We
benchmark extensive state-of-the-art PETL methods on the RSITR task. Our
proposed model only contains 0.16M training parameters, which can achieve a
parameter reduction of 98.9% compared to full fine-tuning, resulting in
substantial savings in training costs. Our retrieval performance exceeds
traditional methods by 7-13% and achieves comparable or better performance than
full fine-tuning. This work can provide new ideas and useful insights for RS
vision-language tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially learn new classes while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. We propose to use
Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) as efficient learners for CIL. MAEs were originally
designed to learn useful representations through reconstructive unsupervised
learning, and they can be easily integrated with a supervised loss for
classification. Moreover, MAEs can reliably reconstruct original input images
from randomly selected patches, which we use to store exemplars from past tasks
more efficiently for CIL. We also propose a bilateral MAE framework to learn
from image-level and embedding-level fusion, which produces better-quality
reconstructed images and more stable representations. Our experiments confirm
that our approach performs better than the state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">3D object detection has achieved significant performance in many fields,
e.g., robotics system, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. However, most
existing methods could cause catastrophic forgetting of old classes when
performing on the class-incremental scenarios. Meanwhile, the current
class-incremental 3D object detection methods neglect the relationships between
the object localization information and category semantic information and
assume all the knowledge of old model is reliable. To address the above
challenge, we present a novel Incremental 3D Object Detection framework with
the guidance of prompting, i.e., I3DOD. Specifically, we propose a task-shared
prompts mechanism to learn the matching relationships between the object
localization information and category semantic information. After training on
the current task, these prompts will be stored in our prompt pool, and perform
the relationship of old classes in the next task. Moreover, we design a
reliable distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from two aspects: a
reliable dynamic distillation is developed to filter out the negative knowledge
and transfer the reliable 3D knowledge to new detection model; the relation
feature is proposed to capture the responses relation in feature space and
protect plasticity of the model when learning novel 3D classes. To the end, we
conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art object detection methods by 0.6% - 2.7% in
terms of mAP@0.25.

<p class="mathjax">Obfuscation in privacy engineering denotes a diverse set of data operations
aimed at reducing the privacy loss that users incur in by participating in
digital systems. Obfuscation's domain of application is vast:
privacy-preserving database analysis, location-based privacy, private web
search or privacy-friendly recommender systems are but a few examples of the
contexts in which privacy engineers have resorted to obfuscation. Yet an
understanding of the role that obfuscation, in general, plays in the
engineering of privacy has so far proved elusive. Similarly, we lack a cohesive
view of the wide array of privacy measures that assist the evaluation of
obfuscation technologies. This paper contributes to closing these research
gaps. First, we provide a general analysis framework that brings together a
multiplicity of obfuscation methods under the same analytical umbrella. Second,
we distinguish between mechanism-centred and attack-centred evaluation, making
explicit a hierarchy of assumptions behind privacy measures that assists and
demystifies obfuscation tools' evaluation. Finally, we examine the role that
obfuscation technology plays in privacy engineering by introducing the concepts
of personal and public utility and distinguishing between utility-degrading and
utility-preserving obfuscation. We observe that public utility requirements
require us to resort to utility-degrading obfuscation to arbitrarily reduce
privacy loss. Conversely, personal utility requirements do not, in theory,
impose such a privacy-utility trade-off, and we illustrate how to perform
utility-preserving obfuscation through chaff.

<p class="mathjax">Target pointing selection is a fundamental task. According to Fitts' law,
users need more time to select targets with smaller sizes. Expanding the target
to a larger size is a practical approach that can facilitate pointing
selection. It has been well-examined and -deployed in 2D user interfaces.
However, limited research has investigated target expansion methods using an
immersive virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD). In this work, we
aimed to fill this gap by conducting a user study using ISO 9241-411
multi-directional pointing task to examine the effect of target expansion on
target selection performance in VR HMD. Based on our results, we found that
compared to not expanding the target, expanding the target width by 1.5 and 2.5
times during the movement can significantly reduce the selection time. We hope
that the design and results derived from the study can help frame future work.

<p class="mathjax">Several earlier studies have shown impressive control performance in complex
robotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training
it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding
controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed
through extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and
time-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining
suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic
systems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers
appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal
computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization
algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion
controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical
attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and
real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained
with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward
coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering
process can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of
constraints. The summary video is available at https://youtu.be/KAlm3yskhvM.

<p class="mathjax">While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language understanding
and in-context learning abilities, their decision-making ability still heavily
relies on the guidance of task-specific expert knowledge when solving
real-world tasks. To unleash the potential of LLMs as autonomous decision
makers, this paper presents an approach JuDec to endow LLMs with the
self-judgment ability, enabling LLMs to achieve autonomous judgment and
exploration for decision making. Specifically, in JuDec, Elo-based
Self-Judgment Mechanism is designed to assign Elo scores to decision steps to
judge their values and utilities via pairwise comparisons between two solutions
and then guide the decision-searching process toward the optimal solution
accordingly. Experimental results on the ToolBench dataset demonstrate JuDec's
superiority over baselines, achieving over 10% improvement in Pass Rate on
diverse tasks. It offers higher-quality solutions and reduces costs (ChatGPT
API calls), highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Solving Nash equilibrium is the key challenge in normal-form games with large
strategy spaces, wherein open-ended learning framework provides an efficient
approach. Previous studies invariably employ diversity as a conduit to foster
the advancement of strategies. Nevertheless, diversity-based algorithms can
only work in zero-sum games with cyclic dimensions, which lead to limitations
in their applicability. Here, we propose an innovative unified open-ended
learning framework SC-PSRO, i.e., Self-Confirming Policy Space Response Oracle,
as a general framework for both zero-sum and general-sum games. In particular,
we introduce the advantage function as an improved evaluation metric for
strategies, allowing for a unified learning objective for agents in normal-form
games. Concretely, SC-PSRO comprises three quintessential components: 1) A
Diversity Module, aiming to avoid strategies to be constrained by the cyclic
structure. 2) A LookAhead Module, devised for the promotion of strategy in the
transitive dimension. This module is theoretically guaranteed to learn
strategies in the direction of the Nash equilibrium. 3) A Confirming-based
Population Clipping Module, contrived for tackling the equilibrium selection
problem in general-sum games. This module can be applied to learn equilibria
with optimal rewards, which to our knowledge is the first improvement for
general-sum games. Our experiments indicate that SC-PSRO accomplishes a
considerable decrease in exploitability in zero-sum games and an escalation in
rewards in general-sum games, markedly surpassing antecedent methodologies.
Code will be released upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models have presented
benefits for alleviating class imbalance in long-tailed recognition. However,
the long-tailed data distribution can corrupt the representation space, where
the distance between head and tail categories is much larger than the distance
between two tail categories. This uneven feature space distribution causes the
model to exhibit unclear and inseparable decision boundaries on the uniformly
distributed test set, which lowers its performance. To address these
challenges, we propose the uniformly category prototype-guided vision-language
framework to effectively mitigate feature space bias caused by data imbalance.
Especially, we generate a set of category prototypes uniformly distributed on a
hypersphere. Category prototype-guided mechanism for image-text matching makes
the features of different classes converge to these distinct and uniformly
distributed category prototypes, which maintain a uniform distribution in the
feature space, and improve class boundaries. Additionally, our proposed
irrelevant text filtering and attribute enhancement module allows the model to
ignore irrelevant noisy text and focus more on key attribute information,
thereby enhancing the robustness of our framework. In the image recognition
fine-tuning stage, to address the positive bias problem of the learnable
classifier, we design the class feature prototype-guided classifier, which
compensates for the performance of tail classes while maintaining the
performance of head classes. Our method outperforms previous vision-language
methods for long-tailed learning work by a large margin and achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents some of our findings on the scalability of parallel 3D
mesh generation on distributed memory machines. The primary objective of this
study was to evaluate a distributed memory approach for implementing a 3D
parallel Delaunay-based algorithm that converts images to meshes by leveraging
an efficient shared memory implementation. The secondary objective was to
evaluate the effectiveness of labor (i.e., reduce development time) while
introducing minimal overheads to maintain the parallel efficiency of the
end-product i.e., distributed implementation. The distributed algorithm
utilizes two existing and independently developed parallel Delaunay-based
methods: (1) a fine-grained method that employs multi-threading and speculative
execution on shared memory nodes and (2) a loosely coupled Delaunay-refinement
framework for multi-node platforms. The shared memory implementation uses a
FIFO work-sharing scheme for thread scheduling, while the distributed memory
implementation utilizes the MPI and the Master-Worker (MW) model. The findings
from the specific MPI-MW implementation we tested suggest that the execution on
(1) 40 cores not necessary in the same single node is 2.3 times faster than the
execution on ten cores, (2) the best speedup is 5.4 with 180 cores again the
comparison is with the best performance on ten cores. A closer look at the
performance of distributed memory and shared memory implementation executing on
a single node (40 cores) suggest that the overheads introduced in the MPI-MW
implementation are high and render the MPI-MW implementation 4 times slower
than the shared memory code using the same number of cores. These findings
raise several questions on the potential scalability of a "black box" approach,
i.e., re-using a code designed to execute efficiently on shared memory machines
without considering its potential use in a distributed memory setting.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought considerable
convenience, yet also introduces significant security risks. One of the
research hotspots is to balance data privacy and utility in the real world of
artificial intelligence. The present second-generation artificial neural
networks have made tremendous advances, but some big models could have really
high computational costs. The third-generation neural network, SNN (Spiking
Neural Network), mimics real neurons by using discrete spike signals, whose
sequences exhibit strong sparsity, providing advantages such as low energy
consumption and high efficiency. In this paper, we construct a framework to
evaluate the homomorphic computation of SNN named FHE-DiSNN that enables SNN to
achieve good prediction performance on encrypted data. First, benefitting from
the discrete nature of spike signals, our proposed model avoids the errors
introduced by discretizing activation functions. Second, by applying
bootstrapping, we design new private preserving functions FHE-Fire and
FHE-Reset, through which noise can be refreshed, allowing us to evaluate SNN
for an arbitrary number of operations. Furthermore, We improve the
computational efficiency of FHE-DiSNN while maintaining a high level of
accuracy. Finally, we evaluate our model on the MNIST dataset. The experiments
show that FHE-DiSNN with 30 neurons in the hidden layer achieves a minimum
prediction accuracy of 94.4%. Under optimal parameters, it achieves a 95.1%
accuracy, with only a 0.6% decrease compared to the original SNN (95.7%). These
results demonstrate the superiority of SNN over second-generation neural
networks for homomorphic evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Meshes are widely used in 3D computer vision and graphics, but their
irregular topology poses challenges in applying them to existing neural network
architectures. Recent advances in mesh neural networks turn to remeshing and
push the boundary of pioneer methods that solely take the raw meshes as input.
Although the remeshing offers a regular topology that significantly facilitates
the design of mesh network architectures, features extracted from such remeshed
proxies may struggle to retain the underlying geometry faithfully, limiting the
subsequent neural network's capacity. To address this issue, we propose
SieveNet, a novel paradigm that takes into account both the regular topology
and the exact geometry. Specifically, this method utilizes structured mesh
topology from remeshing and accurate geometric information from
distortion-aware point sampling on the surface of the original mesh.
Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature
engineering and can leverage off-the-shelf network architectures such as the
vision transformer. Comprehensive experimental results on classification and
segmentation tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
method.

<p class="mathjax">Joint entity and relation extraction is the fundamental task of information
extraction, consisting of two subtasks: named entity recognition and relation
extraction. Most existing joint extraction methods suffer from issues of
feature confusion or inadequate interaction between two subtasks. In this work,
we propose a Co-Attention network for joint entity and Relation Extraction
(CARE). Our approach involves learning separate representations for each
subtask, aiming to avoid feature overlap. At the core of our approach is the
co-attention module that captures two-way interaction between two subtasks,
allowing the model to leverage entity information for relation prediction and
vice versa, thus promoting mutual enhancement. Extensive experiments on three
joint entity-relation extraction benchmark datasets (NYT, WebNLG and SciERC)
show that our proposed model achieves superior performance, surpassing existing
baseline models.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) aggregates locally trained models from individual
clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with
data privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when
client data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have
addressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These
restrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of
local learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local
learning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an
alternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By
obtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates
conflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not
ensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global
objective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on
Learning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and
local generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust
against proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal
restriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local
objective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.

<p class="mathjax">Various approaches are proposed to help under-resourced security researchers
to detect and analyze software vulnerabilities. It is still incredibly
time-consuming and labor-intensive for security researchers to fix
vulnerabilities. The time lag between reporting and fixing a vulnerability
causes software systems to suffer from significant exposure to possible
attacks. Recently, some techniques have proposed applying pre-trained models to
fix security vulnerabilities and have proved their success in improving repair
accuracy. However, the effectiveness of existing pre-trained models has not
been systematically analyzed, and little is known about their advantages and
disadvantages.
<br />To bridge this gap, we perform the first extensive study on applying various
pre-trained models to vulnerability repair. The results show that studied
pre-trained models consistently outperform the state-of-the-art technique
VRepair with a prediction accuracy of 32.94%~44.96%. We also investigate the
impact of major phases in the vulnerability repair workflow. Surprisingly, a
simplistic approach adopting transfer learning improves the prediction accuracy
of pre-trained models by 9.40% on average. Besides, we provide additional
discussion to illustrate the capacity and limitations of pre-trained models.
Finally, we further pinpoint various practical guidelines for advancing
pre-trained model-based vulnerability repair. Our study highlights the
promising future of adopting pre-trained models to patch real-world
vulnerabilities.

<p class="mathjax">RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation has shown great potential in
handling low-light conditions where RGB-based segmentation is hindered by poor
RGB imaging quality. The key to RGB-T semantic segmentation is to effectively
leverage the complementarity nature of RGB and thermal images. Most existing
algorithms fuse RGB and thermal information in feature space via concatenation,
element-wise summation, or attention operations in either unidirectional
enhancement or bidirectional aggregation manners. However, they usually
overlook the modality gap between RGB and thermal images during feature fusion,
resulting in modality-specific information from one modality contaminating the
other. In this paper, we propose a Channel and Spatial Relation-Propagation
Network (CSRPNet) for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which propagates only
modality-shared information across different modalities and alleviates the
modality-specific information contamination issue. Our CSRPNet first performs
relation-propagation in channel and spatial dimensions to capture the
modality-shared features from the RGB and thermal features. CSRPNet then
aggregates the modality-shared features captured from one modality with the
input feature from the other modality to enhance the input feature without the
contamination issue. While being fused together, the enhanced RGB and thermal
features will be also fed into the subsequent RGB or thermal feature extraction
layers for interactive feature fusion, respectively. We also introduce a
dual-path cascaded feature refinement module that aggregates multi-layer
features to produce two refined features for semantic and boundary prediction.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSRPNet performs favorably
against state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the task of learned point cloud compression has gained
prominence. An important type of point cloud, the spinning LiDAR point cloud,
is generated by spinning LiDAR on vehicles. This process results in numerous
circular shapes and azimuthal angle invariance features within the point
clouds. However, these two features have been largely overlooked by previous
methodologies. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic method called
Spherical-Coordinate-based learned Point cloud compression (SCP), designed to
leverage the aforementioned features fully. Additionally, we propose a
multi-level Octree for SCP to mitigate the reconstruction error for distant
areas within the Spherical-coordinate-based Octree. SCP exhibits excellent
universality, making it applicable to various learned point cloud compression
techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that SCP surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods by up to 29.14% in point-to-point PSNR BD-Rate.

<p class="mathjax">Human robot interaction is an exciting task, which aimed to guide robots
following instructions from human. Since huge gap lies between human natural
language and machine codes, end to end human robot interaction models is fair
challenging. Further, visual information receiving from sensors of robot is
also a hard language for robot to perceive. In this work, HuBo-VLM is proposed
to tackle perception tasks associated with human robot interaction including
object detection and visual grounding by a unified transformer based vision

<p class="mathjax">Image fusion aims to generate a high-quality image from multiple images
captured under varying conditions. The key problem of this task is to preserve
complementary information while filtering out irrelevant information for the
fused result. However, existing methods address this problem by leveraging
static convolutional neural networks (CNNs), suffering two inherent limitations
during feature extraction, i.e., being unable to handle spatial-variant
contents and lacking guidance from multiple inputs. In this paper, we propose a
novel mutual-guided dynamic network (MGDN) for image fusion, which allows for
effective information utilization across different locations and inputs.
Specifically, we design a mutual-guided dynamic filter (MGDF) for adaptive
feature extraction, composed of a mutual-guided cross-attention (MGCA) module
and a dynamic filter predictor, where the former incorporates additional
guidance from different inputs and the latter generates spatial-variant kernels
for different locations. In addition, we introduce a parallel feature fusion
(PFF) module to effectively fuse local and global information of the extracted
features. To further reduce the redundancy among the extracted features while
simultaneously preserving their shared structural information, we devise a
novel loss function that combines the minimization of normalized mutual
information (NMI) with an estimated gradient mask. Experimental results on five
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing
methods on four image fusion tasks. The code and model are publicly available
at: https://github.com/Guanys-dar/MGDN.

<p class="mathjax">As language models (LMs) become increasingly powerful, it is important to
quantify and compare them for sociodemographic bias with potential for harm.
Prior bias measurement datasets are sensitive to perturbations in their
manually designed templates, therefore unreliable. To achieve reliability, we
introduce the Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias (CALM), a
benchmark dataset to quantify bias in LMs across three tasks. We integrate 16
existing datasets across different domains, such as Wikipedia and news
articles, to filter 224 templates from which we construct a dataset of 78,400
examples. We compare the diversity of CALM with prior datasets on metrics such
as average semantic similarity, and variation in template length, and test the
sensitivity to small perturbations. We show that our dataset is more diverse
and reliable than previous datasets, thus better capture the breadth of
linguistic variation required to reliably evaluate model bias. We evaluate 20
large language models including six prominent families of LMs such as Llama-2.
In two LM series, OPT and Bloom, we found that larger parameter models are more
biased than lower parameter models. We found the T0 series of models to be the
least biased. Furthermore, we noticed a tradeoff between gender and racial bias
with increasing model size in some model series. The code is available at
https://github.com/vipulgupta1011/CALM.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a fully decentralized scenario in which no central trusted entity
exists and all clients are honest-but-curious. The state-of-the-art approaches
to this problem often rely on cryptographic protocols, such as multiparty
computation (MPC), that require mapping real-valued data to a discrete
alphabet, specifically a finite field. These approaches, however, can result in
substantial accuracy losses due to computation overflows. To address this
issue, we propose A-MPC, a private analog MPC protocol that performs all
computations in the analog domain. We characterize the privacy of individual
datasets in terms of $(\epsilon, \delta)$-local differential privacy, where the
privacy of a single record in each client's dataset is guaranteed against other
participants. In particular, we characterize the required noise variance in the
Gaussian mechanism in terms of the required $(\epsilon,\delta)$-local
differential privacy parameters by solving an optimization problem.
Furthermore, compared with existing decentralized protocols, A-MPC keeps the
privacy of individual datasets against the collusion of all other participants,
thereby, in a notably significant improvement, increasing the maximum number of
colluding clients tolerated in the protocol by a factor of three compared with
the state-of-the-art collaborative learning protocols. Our experiments
illustrate that the accuracy of the proposed $(\epsilon,\delta)$-locally
differential private logistic regression and linear regression models trained
in a fully-decentralized fashion using A-MPC closely follows that of a
centralized one performed by a single trusted entity.

<p class="mathjax">Software developers typically rely upon a large network of dependencies to
build their applications. For instance, the NPM package repository contains
over 3 million packages and serves tens of billions of downloads weekly.
Understanding the structure and nature of packages, dependencies, and published
code requires datasets that provide researchers with easy access to metadata
and code of packages. However, prior work on NPM dataset construction typically
has two limitations: 1) only metadata is scraped, and 2) packages or versions
that are deleted from NPM can not be scraped. Over 330,000 versions of packages
were deleted from NPM between July 2022 and May 2023. This data is critical for
researchers as it often pertains to important questions of security and
malware. We present npm-follower, a dataset and crawling architecture which
archives metadata and code of all packages and versions as they are published,
and is thus able to retain data which is later deleted. The dataset currently
includes over 35 million versions of packages, and grows at a rate of about 1
million versions per month. The dataset is designed to be easily used by
researchers answering questions involving either metadata or program analysis.
Both the code and dataset are available at https://dependencies.science.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on the use of emotion recognition techniques to assist
psychologists in performing children's therapy through remotely robot operated
sessions. In the field of psychology, the use of agent-mediated therapy is
growing increasingly given recent advances in robotics and computer science.
Specifically, the use of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) as an
intermediary tool can help professionals connect with children who face social
challenges such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or even who are physically unavailable due to being in
regions of armed conflict, natural disasters, or other circumstances. In this
context, emotion recognition represents an important feedback for the
psychotherapist. In this article, we initially present the result of a
bibliographical research associated with emotion recognition in children. This
research revealed an initial overview on algorithms and datasets widely used by
the community. Then, based on the analysis carried out on the results of the
bibliographical research, we used the technique of dense optical flow features
to improve the ability of identifying emotions in children in uncontrolled
environments. From the output of a hybrid model of Convolutional Neural
Network, two intermediary features are fused before being processed by a final
classifier. The proposed architecture was called HybridCNNFusion. Finally, we
present the initial results achieved in the recognition of children's emotions
using a dataset of Brazilian children.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a generalized Japan Standard Time algorithm
(JST-algo) for higher-order atomic clock ensembles and mathematically clarify
the relations of the (generalized) JST-algo and the conventional Kalman
filtering algorithm (CKF-algo) in the averaged atomic time and the clock
residuals for time scale generation. In particular, we reveal the fact that the
averaged atomic time of the generalized JST-algo does not depend on the
observation noise even though the measurement signal is not filtered in the
algorithm. Furthermore, the prediction error of CKF- algo is rigorously shown
by using the prediction error regarding an observable state space. It is
mathematically shown that when the covariance matrices of system noises are
identical for all atomic clocks, considering equal averaging weights for the
clocks is a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure equivalence between
the generalized JST-algo and CKF-algo in averaged atomic time. In such
homogeneous systems, a necessary and sufficient condition for observation
noises is presented to determine which algorithm can generate the clock
residuals with smaller variances. A couple of numerical examples comparing the
generalized JST-algo and CKF-algo are provided to illustrate the efficacy of
the results.

<p class="mathjax">Siamese network has been a de facto benchmark framework for 3D LiDAR object
tracking with a shared-parametric encoder extracting features from template and
search region, respectively. This paradigm relies heavily on an additional
matching network to model the cross-correlation/similarity of the template and
search region. In this paper, we forsake the conventional Siamese paradigm and
propose a novel single-branch framework, SyncTrack, synchronizing the feature
extracting and matching to avoid forwarding encoder twice for template and
search region as well as introducing extra parameters of matching network. The
synchronization mechanism is based on the dynamic affinity of the Transformer,
and an in-depth analysis of the relevance is provided theoretically. Moreover,
based on the synchronization, we introduce a novel Attentive Points-Sampling
strategy into the Transformer layers (APST), replacing the random/Farthest
Points Sampling (FPS) method with sampling under the supervision of attentive
relations between the template and search region. It implies connecting
point-wise sampling with the feature learning, beneficial to aggregating more
distinctive and geometric features for tracking with sparse points. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets (KITTI and NuScenes) show that SyncTrack
achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time tracking.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the increasing concerns over environmental challenges such as
global warming and the exhaustion of fossil-fuel reserves, the renewable energy
industry has become the most demanded electrical energy production source
worldwide. In this context, wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) are the most
dominant and fastest-growing alternative energy production technologies,
playing an increasingly vital role in renewable power generation. To tackle the
pitch control problem of WECSs, this thesis proposes an optimal fault-tolerant
fractional-order pitch control strategy for pitch angle regulation of WT blades
subjected to sensor, actuator, and system faults. To showcast the effects of
faults, changes in the system parameters are considered as a result of sensor,
actuator and system faults with various levels of severity.} Furthermore,
taking advantage of the favourable merits of higher-order SMCs and fractional
calculus, this thesis develops a fault-tolerant fractional-calculus-based
higher-order sliding mode controller for optimum rotor speed tracking and power
production maximization of WECSs. \textcolor{black}{The partial loss of the
generator output torque is considered as an actuator failure, leading to loss
of partial actuation power. Moreover, active fault-tolerant fractional-order
higher-order SMC strategies are developed for rotor current regulation and
speed trajectory tracking of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) -driven
WECSs subjected to model uncertainties and rotor current sensor faults. The
developed controllers are augmented with two state observers, an algebraic
state estimator and a sliding mode observer, to estimate the rotor current
dynamics during sensors' faults.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we focus on robust time series representation learning. Our
assumption is that real-world time series is noisy and complementary
information from different views of the same time series plays an important
role while analyzing noisy input. Based on this, we create two views for the
input time series through two different encoders. We conduct co-training based
contrastive learning iteratively to learn the encoders. Our experiments
demonstrate that this co-training approach leads to a significant improvement
in performance. Especially, by leveraging the complementary information from
different views, our proposed TS-CoT method can mitigate the impact of data
noise and corruption. Empirical evaluations on four time series benchmarks in
unsupervised and semi-supervised settings reveal that TS-CoT outperforms
existing methods. Furthermore, the representations learned by TS-CoT can
transfer well to downstream tasks through fine-tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Common explanations for shortcut learning assume that the shortcut improves
prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.
Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of
cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even
when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and
the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception
tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions
preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable
feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's
preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the
shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This
insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin
is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias
toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on
the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss
functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control
(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and
language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for
expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In order to coordinate energy interactions among various communities and
energy conversions among multi-energy subsystems within the multi-community
integrated energy system under uncertain conditions, and achieve overall
optimization and scheduling of the comprehensive energy system, this paper
proposes a comprehensive scheduling model that utilizes a multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning algorithm to learn load characteristics of different
communities and make decisions based on this knowledge. In this model, the
scheduling problem of the integrated energy system is transformed into a Markov
decision process and solved using a data-driven deep reinforcement learning
algorithm, which avoids the need for modeling complex energy coupling
relationships between multi-communities and multi-energy subsystems. The
simulation results show that the proposed method effectively captures the load
characteristics of different communities and utilizes their complementary
features to coordinate reasonable energy interactions among them. This leads to
a reduction in wind curtailment rate from 16.3% to 0% and lowers the overall
operating cost by 5445.6 Yuan, demonstrating significant economic and
environmental benefits.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-visual zero-shot learning aims to classify samples consisting of a pair
of corresponding audio and video sequences from classes that are not present
during training. An analysis of the audio-visual data reveals a large degree of
hyperbolicity, indicating the potential benefit of using a hyperbolic
transformation to achieve curvature-aware geometric learning, with the aim of
exploring more complex hierarchical data structures for this task. The proposed
approach employs a novel loss function that incorporates cross-modality
alignment between video and audio features in the hyperbolic space.
Additionally, we explore the use of multiple adaptive curvatures for hyperbolic
projections. The experimental results on this very challenging task demonstrate
that our proposed hyperbolic approach for zero-shot learning outperforms the
SOTA method on three datasets: VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL
achieving a harmonic mean (HM) improvement of around 3.0%, 7.0%, and 5.3%,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Thermal-aware workload distribution is a common approach in the literature
for power consumption optimization in data centers. However, data centers also
have other operational costs such as the cost of equipment maintenance and
replacement. It has been shown that server reliability depends on frequency of
their temperature variations, arising from workload transitions due to dynamic
demands. In this work, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem that
considers the cost of workload transitions in addition to IT and cooling power
consumption. To approximate the solution, we first linearize the problem; the
result is a mixed integer programming problem. A modified heuristic is then
proposed to approximate the solution of the linear problem. Finally, a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) approach is integrated with the proposed heuristics
for automatic workload reconfiguration when future demand is not known exactly,
but predictions are available. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes
are attractive in different settings.

<p class="mathjax">Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is a framework for making
interpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of
task-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are
most informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability
in predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with
dense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to
small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we
extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this
limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of
task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to
annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the
generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing
repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and
test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a
sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed
FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we
show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test
performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the
effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when
compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can
achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in
both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.

<p class="mathjax">Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic
datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled
experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge
of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is
frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the
realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD).
This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the
training data are contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called
TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase.
TSAD-C encompasses three modules: a Decontaminator to rectify the abnormalities
(aka noise) present in the training data, a Variable Dependency Modeling module
to capture both long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the
decontaminated data that can be considered as a surrogate of the pure normal
data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies. Our extensive
experiments conducted on three widely used physiological datasets conclusively
demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methodologies, thus
establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the field.

<p class="mathjax">In clinical dictation, utterances after automatic speech recognition (ASR)
without explicit punctuation marks may lead to the misunderstanding of dictated
reports. To give a precise and understandable clinical report with ASR,
automatic punctuation restoration is required. Considering a practical
scenario, we propose a fast and light pre-trained model for Chinese medical
punctuation restoration based on 'pretraining and fine-tuning' paradigm. In
this work, we distill pre-trained models by incorporating supervised
contrastive learning and a novel auxiliary pre-training task (Punctuation Mark
Prediction) to make it well-suited for punctuation restoration. Our experiments
on various distilled models reveal that our model can achieve 95% performance

<p class="mathjax">High-Definition (HD) maps are essential for the safety of autonomous driving
systems. While existing techniques employ camera images and onboard sensors to
generate vectorized high-precision maps, they are constrained by their reliance
on single-frame input. This approach limits their stability and performance in
complex scenarios such as occlusions, largely due to the absence of temporal
information. Moreover, their performance diminishes when applied to broader
perception ranges. In this paper, we present StreamMapNet, a novel online
mapping pipeline adept at long-sequence temporal modeling of videos.
StreamMapNet employs multi-point attention and temporal information which
empowers the construction of large-range local HD maps with high stability and
further addresses the limitations of existing methods. Furthermore, we
critically examine widely used online HD Map construction benchmark and
datasets, Argoverse2 and nuScenes, revealing significant bias in the existing
evaluation protocols. We propose to resplit the benchmarks according to
geographical spans, promoting fair and precise evaluations. Experimental
results validate that StreamMapNet significantly outperforms existing methods
across all settings while maintaining an online inference speed of $14.2$ FPS.

<p class="mathjax">Imitation Learning (IL) is an important paradigm within the broader
reinforcement learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume
availability of reward-feedback. Reward inference and shaping are known to be
difficult and error-prone methods particularly when the demonstration data
comes from human experts. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and
inverse reinforcement learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, a
problem that is particularly acute in continuous state space problems.
Meanwhile, state-of-the-art IL algorithms convert behavioral policy learning
problems into distribution-matching problems which often require additional
online interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem
of imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on
observed behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward
structure, or, most importantly, any additional interactions with the
environment. Our approach is based on the Markov balance equation and
introduces a novel conditional kernel density estimation-based imitation
learning framework. It involves estimating the environment's transition
dynamics using conditional kernel density estimators and seeks to satisfy the
probabilistic balance equations for the environment. We establish that our
estimators satisfy basic asymptotic consistency requirements. Through a series
of numerical experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show
consistently superior empirical performance over many state-of-the-art IL
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">The integration of retrieved passages and large language models (LLMs), such
as ChatGPTs, has significantly contributed to improving open-domain question
answering. However, there is still a lack of exploration regarding the optimal
approach for incorporating retrieved passages into the answer generation
process. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating different methods of
combining retrieved passages with LLMs to enhance answer generation. We begin
by examining the limitations of a commonly-used concatenation approach.
Surprisingly, this approach often results in generating "unknown" outputs, even
when the correct document is among the top-k retrieved passages. To address
this issue, we explore four alternative strategies for integrating the
retrieved passages with the LLMs. These strategies include two single-round
methods that utilize chain-of-thought reasoning and two multi-round strategies
that incorporate feedback loops. Through comprehensive analyses and
experiments, we provide insightful observations on how to effectively leverage
retrieved passages to enhance the answer generation capability of LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is one of the most important parts of a
hospital, which admits critically ill patients and provides continuous
monitoring and treatment. Various patient outcome prediction methods have been
attempted to assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making.
Existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep
neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. However, the
higher-order relationships are ignored, such as patient characteristics (e.g.,
diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions.
<br />In this paper, we propose a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network that
allows the representation of non-pairwise relationships among diagnosis codes
in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained
patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk
prediction. Evaluation using a publicly available eICU Collaborative Research

<p class="mathjax">Existing K-nearest neighbor (KNN) retrieval-based methods usually conduct
industrial anomaly detection in two stages: obtain feature representations with
a pre-trained CNN model and perform distance measures for defect detection.
However, the features are not fully exploited as they ignore domain bias and
the difference of local density in feature space, which limits the detection
performance. In this paper, we propose Reducing Biases (REB) in representation
by considering the domain bias of the pre-trained model and building a
self-supervised learning task for better domain adaption with a defect
generation strategy (DefectMaker) imitating the natural defects. Additionally,
we propose a local density KNN (LDKNN) to reduce the local density bias and
obtain effective anomaly detection. We achieve a promising result of 99.5\%
AUROC on the widely used MVTec AD benchmark. We also achieve 88.0\% AUROC on
the challenging MVTec LOCO AD dataset and bring an improvement of 4.7\% AUROC
to the state-of-the-art result. All results are obtained with smaller backbone
networks such as Vgg11 and Resnet18, which indicates the effectiveness and
efficiency of REB for practical industrial applications.

<p class="mathjax">Recent researches indicate that Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
possess cognitive constructs similar to those observed in humans, prompting
researchers to investigate the cognitive aspects of LLMs. This paper focuses on
explicit and implicit social bias, a distinctive two-level cognitive construct
in psychology. It posits that individuals' explicit social bias, which is their
conscious expression of bias in the statements, may differ from their implicit
social bias, which represents their unconscious bias. We propose a two-stage
approach and discover a parallel phenomenon in LLMs known as "re-judge
inconsistency" in social bias. In the initial stage, the LLM is tasked with
automatically completing statements, potentially incorporating implicit social
bias. However, in the subsequent stage, the same LLM re-judges the biased
statement generated by itself but contradicts it. We propose that this re-judge
inconsistency can be similar to the inconsistency between human's unaware
implicit social bias and their aware explicit social bias. Experimental
investigations on ChatGPT and GPT-4 concerning common gender biases examined in
psychology corroborate the highly stable nature of the re-judge inconsistency.
This finding may suggest that diverse cognitive constructs emerge as LLMs'
capabilities strengthen. Consequently, leveraging psychological theories can
provide enhanced insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the
expressions of explicit and implicit constructs in LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Why are some research studies easy to reproduce while others are difficult?
Casting doubt on the accuracy of scientific work is not fruitful, especially
when an individual researcher cannot reproduce the claims made in the paper.
There could be many subjective reasons behind the inability to reproduce a
scientific paper. The field of Machine Learning (ML) faces a reproducibility
crisis, and surveying a portion of published articles has resulted in a group
realization that although sharing code repositories would be appreciable, code
bases are not the end all be all for determining the reproducibility of an
article. Various parties involved in the publication process have come forward
to address the reproducibility crisis and solutions such as badging articles as
reproducible, reproducibility checklists at conferences (\textit{NeurIPS, ICML,
ICLR, etc.}), and sharing artifacts on \textit{OpenReview} come across as
promising solutions to the core problem. The breadth of literature on
reproducibility focuses on measures required to avoid ir-reproducibility, and
there is not much research into the effort behind reproducing these articles.
In this paper, we investigate the factors that contribute to the easiness and
difficulty of reproducing previously published studies and report on the
foundational framework to quantify effort of reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To combat
this, we introduce a novel aggregator based on Huber loss minimization, and
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Under independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d) assumption, our approach has several advantages compared to
existing methods. Firstly, it has optimal dependence on $\epsilon$, which
stands for the ratio of attacked clients. Secondly, our approach does not need
precise knowledge of $\epsilon$. Thirdly, it allows different clients to have
unequal data sizes. We then broaden our analysis to include non-i.i.d data,
such that clients have slightly different distributions.

<p class="mathjax">Handling entirely unknown data is a challenge for any deployed classifier.
Classification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and
are kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they
struggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing
this task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However,
most OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers
and only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR. This work presents LORD, a
framework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD
explicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a
systematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic
training strategies that exploit background data and applied them to
well-established classifiers. Due to LORD's extensive evaluation protocol, we
consistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks
facilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate
dependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an
off-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixup's
effectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints
on mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-modal alignment is one key challenge for Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN). Most existing studies concentrate on mapping the global instruction or
single sub-instruction to the corresponding trajectory. However, another
critical problem of achieving fine-grained alignment at the entity level is
seldom considered. To address this problem, we propose a novel Grounded
Entity-Landmark Adaptive (GELA) pre-training paradigm for VLN tasks. To achieve
the adaptive pre-training paradigm, we first introduce grounded entity-landmark
human annotations into the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset, named GEL-R2R.
Additionally, we adopt three grounded entity-landmark adaptive pre-training
objectives: 1) entity phrase prediction, 2) landmark bounding box prediction,
and 3) entity-landmark semantic alignment, which explicitly supervise the
learning of fine-grained cross-modal alignment between entity phrases and
environment landmarks. Finally, we validate our model on two downstream
benchmarks: VLN with descriptive instructions (R2R) and dialogue instructions
(CVDN). The comprehensive experiments show that our GELA model achieves
state-of-the-art results on both tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalizability.

<p class="mathjax">Learning 3D shape representation with dense correspondence for deformable
objects is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Existing approaches often
need additional annotations of specific semantic domain, e.g., skeleton poses
for human bodies or animals, which require extra annotation effort and suffer
from error accumulation, and they are limited to specific domain. In this
paper, we propose a novel self-supervised approach to learn neural implicit
shape representation for deformable objects, which can represent shapes with a
template shape and dense correspondence in 3D. Our method does not require the
priors of skeleton and skinning weight, and only requires a collection of
shapes represented in signed distance fields. To handle the large deformation,
we constrain the learned template shape in the same latent space with the
training shapes, design a new formulation of local rigid constraint that
enforces rigid transformation in local region and addresses local reflection
issue, and present a new hierarchical rigid constraint to reduce the ambiguity
due to the joint learning of template shape and correspondences. Extensive
experiments show that our model can represent shapes with large deformations.
We also show that our shape representation can support two typical
applications, such as texture transfer and shape editing, with competitive
performance. The code and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on kernelization algorithms for the fundamental Knapsack
problem. A kernelization algorithm (or kernel) is a polynomial-time reduction
from a problem onto itself, where the output size is bounded by a function of
some problem-specific parameter. Such algorithms provide a theoretical model
for data reduction and preprocessing and are central in the area of
parameterized complexity. In this way, a kernel for Knapsack for some parameter
$k$ reduces any instance of Knapsack to an equivalent instance of size at most
$f(k)$ in polynomial time, for some computable function $f(\cdot)$. When
$f(k)=k^{O(1)}$ then we call such a reduction a polynomial kernel.
<br />Our study focuses on two natural parameters for Knapsack: The number of
different item weights $w_{\#}$, and the number of different item profits
$p_{\#}$. Our main technical contribution is a proof showing that Knapsack does
not admit a polynomial kernel for any of these two parameters under standard
complexity-theoretic assumptions. Our proof discovers an elaborate application
of the standard kernelization lower bound framework, and develops along the way
novel ideas that should be useful for other problems as well. We complement our
lower bounds by showing the Knapsack admits a polynomial kernel for the
combined parameter $w_{\#}+p_{\#}$.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in semi-supervised semantic segmentation have been heavily
reliant on pseudo labeling to compensate for limited labeled data, disregarding
the valuable relational knowledge among semantic concepts. To bridge this gap,
we devise LogicDiag, a brand new neural-logic semi-supervised learning
framework. Our key insight is that conflicts within pseudo labels, identified
through symbolic knowledge, can serve as strong yet commonly ignored learning
signals. LogicDiag resolves such conflicts via reasoning with logic-induced
diagnoses, enabling the recovery of (potentially) erroneous pseudo labels,
ultimately alleviating the notorious error accumulation problem. We showcase
the practical application of LogicDiag in the data-hungry segmentation
scenario, where we formalize the structured abstraction of semantic concepts as
a set of logic rules. Extensive experiments on three standard semi-supervised
semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality
of LogicDiag. Moreover, LogicDiag highlights the promising opportunities
arising from the systematic integration of symbolic reasoning into the
prevalent statistical, neural learning approaches.

<p class="mathjax">With the proliferation of video platforms on the internet, recording musical
performances by mobile devices has become commonplace. However, these
recordings often suffer from degradation such as noise and reverberation, which
negatively impact the listening experience. Consequently, the necessity for
music audio enhancement (referred to as music enhancement from this point
onward), involving the transformation of degraded audio recordings into
pristine high-quality music, has surged to augment the auditory experience. To
address this issue, we propose a music enhancement system based on the
Conformer architecture that has demonstrated outstanding performance in speech
enhancement tasks. Our approach explores the attention mechanisms of the
Conformer and examines their performance to discover the best approach for the
music enhancement task. Our experimental results show that our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-stem music enhancement.
Furthermore, our system can perform general music enhancement with multi-track
mixtures, which has not been examined in previous work.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic medical report generation (MRG) is of great research value as it
has the potential to relieve radiologists from the heavy burden of report
writing. Despite recent advancements, accurate MRG remains challenging due to
the need for precise clinical understanding and the identification of clinical
findings. Moreover, the imbalanced distribution of diseases makes the challenge
even more pronounced, as rare diseases are underrepresented in training data,
making their diagnostic performance unreliable. To address these challenges, we
propose diagnosis-driven prompts for medical report generation (PromptMRG), a
novel framework that aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRG with the
guidance of diagnosis-aware prompts. Specifically, PromptMRG is based on
encoder-decoder architecture with an extra disease classification branch. When
generating reports, the diagnostic results from the classification branch are
converted into token prompts to explicitly guide the generation process. To
further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we design cross-modal feature
enhancement, which retrieves similar reports from the database to assist the
diagnosis of a query image by leveraging the knowledge from a pre-trained CLIP.
Moreover, the disease imbalanced issue is addressed by applying an adaptive
logit-adjusted loss to the classification branch based on the individual
learning status of each disease, which overcomes the barrier of text decoder's
inability to manipulate disease distributions. Experiments on two MRG
benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where it obtains
state-of-the-art clinical efficacy performance on both datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have exhibited promising progress in video generation.
However, they often struggle to retain consistent details within local regions
across frames. One underlying cause is that traditional diffusion models
approximate Gaussian noise distribution by utilizing predictive noise, without
fully accounting for the impact of inherent information within the input
itself. Additionally, these models emphasize the distinction between
predictions and references, neglecting information intrinsic to the videos. To
address this limitation, inspired by the self-attention mechanism, we propose a
novel text-to-video (T2V) generation network structure based on diffusion
models, dubbed Additional Perturbation for Latent noise with Adversarial
training (APLA). Our approach only necessitates a single video as input and
builds upon pre-trained stable diffusion networks. Notably, we introduce an
additional compact network, known as the Video Generation Transformer (VGT).
This auxiliary component is designed to extract perturbations from the inherent
information contained within the input, thereby refining inconsistent pixels
during temporal predictions. We leverage a hybrid architecture of transformers
and convolutions to compensate for temporal intricacies, enhancing consistency
between different frames within the video. Experiments demonstrate a noticeable
improvement in the consistency of the generated videos both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PSTAL) is an emerging research
direction for label-efficient learning. However, current methods mainly focus
on optimizing the network either at the snippet-level or the instance-level,
neglecting the inherent reliability of point annotations at both levels. In
this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Reliability Propagation (HR-Pro)
framework, which consists of two reliability-aware stages: Snippet-level
Discrimination Learning and Instance-level Completeness Learning, both stages
explore the efficient propagation of high-confidence cues in point annotations.
For snippet-level learning, we introduce an online-updated memory to store
reliable snippet prototypes for each class. We then employ a Reliability-aware
Attention Block to capture both intra-video and inter-video dependencies of
snippets, resulting in more discriminative and robust snippet representation.
For instance-level learning, we propose a point-based proposal generation
approach as a means of connecting snippets and instances, which produces
high-confidence proposals for further optimization at the instance level.
Through multi-level reliability-aware learning, we obtain more reliable
confidence scores and more accurate temporal boundaries of predicted proposals.
Our HR-Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging
benchmarks, including an impressive average mAP of 60.3% on THUMOS14. Notably,
our HR-Pro largely surpasses all previous point-supervised methods, and even
outperforms several competitive fully supervised methods. Code will be
available at https://github.com/pipixin321/HR-Pro.

<p class="mathjax">Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WSTAL) aims to localize
actions in untrimmed videos using video-level labels. Despite recent advances,
existing approaches mainly follow a localization-by-classification pipeline,
generally processing each segment individually, thereby exploiting only limited
contextual information. As a result, the model will lack a comprehensive
understanding (e.g. appearance and temporal structure) of various action
patterns, leading to ambiguity in classification learning and temporal
localization. Our work addresses this from a novel perspective, by exploring
and exploiting the cross-video contextual knowledge within the dataset to
recover the dataset-level semantic structure of action instances via weak
labels only, thereby indirectly improving the holistic understanding of
fine-grained action patterns and alleviating the aforementioned ambiguities.
Specifically, an end-to-end framework is proposed, including a Robust
Memory-Guided Contrastive Learning (RMGCL) module and a Global Knowledge
Summarization and Aggregation (GKSA) module. First, the RMGCL module explores
the contrast and consistency of cross-video action features, assisting in
learning more structured and compact embedding space, thus reducing ambiguity
in classification learning. Further, the GKSA module is used to efficiently
summarize and propagate the cross-video representative action knowledge in a
learnable manner to promote holistic action patterns understanding, which in
turn allows the generation of high-confidence pseudo-labels for self-learning,
thus alleviating ambiguity in temporal localization. Extensive experiments on
THUMOS14, ActivityNet1.3, and FineAction demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and can be easily plugged into other
WSTAL methods.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional music search engines rely on retrieval methods that match natural
language queries with music metadata. There have been increasing efforts to
expand retrieval methods to consider the audio characteristics of music itself,
using queries of various modalities including text, video, and speech. Most
approaches aim to match general music semantics to the input queries, while
only a few focus on affective qualities. We address the task of retrieving
emotionally-relevant music from image queries by proposing a framework for
learning an affective alignment between images and music audio. Our approach
focuses on learning an emotion-aligned joint embedding space between images and
music. This joint embedding space is learned via emotion-supervised contrastive
learning, using an adapted cross-modal version of the SupCon loss. We directly
evaluate the joint embeddings with cross-modal retrieval tasks (image-to-music
and music-to-image) based on emotion labels. In addition, we investigate the
generalizability of the learned music embeddings with automatic music tagging
as a downstream task. Our experiments show that our approach successfully
aligns images and music, and that the learned embedding space is effective for
cross-modal retrieval applications.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid growth of deep learning (DL) has spurred interest in enhancing
log-based anomaly detection. This approach aims to extract meaning from log
events (log message templates) and develop advanced DL models for anomaly
detection. However, these DL methods face challenges like heavy reliance on
training data, labels, and computational resources due to model complexity. In
contrast, traditional machine learning and data mining techniques are less
data-dependent and more efficient but less effective than DL. To make log-based
anomaly detection more practical, the goal is to enhance traditional techniques
to match DL's effectiveness. Previous research in a different domain (linking
questions on Stack Overflow) suggests that optimized traditional techniques can
rival state-of-the-art DL methods. Drawing inspiration from this concept, we
conducted an empirical study. We optimized the unsupervised PCA (Principal
Component Analysis), a traditional technique, by incorporating lightweight
semantic-based log representation. This addresses the issue of unseen log
events in training data, enhancing log representation. Our study compared seven
log-based anomaly detection methods, including four DL-based, two traditional,
and the optimized PCA technique, using public and industrial datasets. Results
indicate that the optimized unsupervised PCA technique achieves similar
effectiveness to advanced supervised/semi-supervised DL methods while being
more stable with limited training data and resource-efficient. This
demonstrates the adaptability and strength of traditional techniques through
small yet impactful adaptations.

<p class="mathjax">Reducing noise interference is crucial for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
in a real-world scenario. However, most single-channel speech enhancement (SE)
generates "processing artifacts" that negatively affect ASR performance. Hence,
in this study, we suggest a Noise- and Artifacts-aware loss function, NAaLoss,
to ameliorate the influence of artifacts from a novel perspective. NAaLoss
considers the loss of estimation, de-artifact, and noise ignorance, enabling
the learned SE to individually model speech, artifacts, and noise. We examine
two SE models (simple/advanced) learned with NAaLoss under various input
scenarios (clean/noisy) using two configurations of the ASR system
(with/without noise robustness). Experiments reveal that NAaLoss significantly
improves the ASR performance of most setups while preserving the quality of SE
toward perception and intelligibility. Furthermore, we visualize artifacts
through waveforms and spectrograms, and explain their impact on ASR.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking under
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and quantization. The players can only exchange
information with their own direct neighbors. The transmitted information is
subject to quantization and packet losses induced by malicious DoS attacks. We
propose a quantized distributed NE seeking strategy based on the approach of
dynamic quantized consensus. To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused
by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and
holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the
results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number
of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from
saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking
strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks.
Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an
attacker can deny all the transmissions and hence distributed NE seeking is
impossible.

<p class="mathjax">Eigenvector decomposition (EVD) is an inevitable operation to obtain the
precoders in practical massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
Due to the large antenna size and at finite computation resources at the base
station (BS), the overwhelming computation complexity of EVD is one of the key
limiting factors of the system performance. To address this problem, we propose
an eigenvector prediction (EGVP) method by interpolating the precoding matrix
with predicted eigenvectors. The basic idea is to exploit a few historical
precoders to interpolate the rest of them without EVD of the channel state
information (CSI). We transform the nonlinear EVD into a linear prediction
problem and prove that the prediction of the eigenvectors can be achieved with
a complex exponential model. Furthermore, a channel prediction method called
fast matrix pencil prediction (FMPP) is proposed to cope with the CSI delay
when applying the EGVP method in mobility environments. The asymptotic analysis
demonstrates how many samples are needed to achieve asymptotically error-free
eigenvector predictions and channel predictions. Finally, the simulation
results demonstrate the spectral efficiency improvement of our scheme over the
benchmarks and the robustness to different mobility scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient modeling of jet diffusion during accidental release is critical for
operation and maintenance management of hydrogen facilities. Deep learning has
proven effective for concentration prediction in gas jet diffusion scenarios.
Nonetheless, its reliance on extensive simulations as training data and its
potential disregard for physical laws limit its applicability to unseen
accidental scenarios. Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have
emerged to reconstruct spatial information by using data from
sparsely-distributed sensors which are easily collected in real-world
applications. However, prevailing approaches use the fully-connected neural
network as the backbone without considering the spatial dependency of sensor
data, which reduces the accuracy of concentration prediction. This study
introduces the physics-informed graph deep learning approach (Physic_GNN) for
efficient and accurate hydrogen jet diffusion prediction by using
sparsely-distributed sensor data. Graph neural network (GNN) is used to model
the spatial dependency of such sensor data by using graph nodes at which
governing equations describing the physical law of hydrogen jet diffusion are
immediately solved. The computed residuals are then applied to constrain the
training process. Public experimental data of hydrogen jet is used to compare
the accuracy and efficiency between our proposed approach Physic_GNN and
state-of-the-art PINN. The results demonstrate our Physic_GNN exhibits higher
accuracy and physical consistency of centerline concentration prediction given
sparse concentration compared to PINN and more efficient compared to OpenFOAM.
The proposed approach enables accurate and robust real-time spatial consequence
reconstruction and underlying physical mechanisms analysis by using sparse
sensor data.

<p class="mathjax">We study the Uniform Cardinality Constrained Multiple Knapsack problem (CMK),
a natural generalization of Multiple Knapsack with applications ranging from
cloud computing to radio networks. The input is a set of items, each has a
value and a weight, and a set of uniform capacity bins. The goal is to assign a
subset of the items of maximum total value to the bins such that $(i)$ the
capacity of any bin is not exceeded, and $(ii)$ the number of items assigned to
each bin satisfies a given cardinality constraint. The best known approximation
ratio for CMK is $1-\frac{\ln (2)}{2} -\epsilon \approx 0.653$, which follows
from a result for a generalization of the problem.
<br />Our main contribution is an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme
(EPTAS) for CMK. This essentially resolves the complexity status of the
problem, since the existence of a fully polynomial time approximation scheme
(FPTAS) is ruled out. Our technique is based on the following simple algorithm:
in each iteration, solve a configuration linear program (LP) of the problem;
then, sample configurations (i.e., feasible subsets of items for a single bin)
according to a distribution specified by the LP solution. The algorithm
terminates once each bin is assigned a configuration. We believe that our
generic technique may lead to efficient approximations for other assignment
problems.

<p class="mathjax">Logs are valuable information for oil and gas fields as they help to
determine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the
location and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important
logs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in
field applications. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine
learning competition of the SPWLA, which aims to predict the missing
compressional wave slowness and shear wave slowness logs using other logs in
the same borehole. We employ the NGBoost algorithm to construct an Ensemble
Learning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty.
Furthermore, we combine the SHAP method to investigate the interpretability of
the machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model
with four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random
Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model
performs well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for
the prediction results. In addition, the variance of the probability
distribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the
constructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we
calculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as
the coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the
NGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the
neutron porosity and gamma ray are large, which is consistent with the
cognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can
capture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the
influence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish
a direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle
of borehole acoustics.

<p class="mathjax">Intrusion detection systems (IDS) reinforce cyber defense by autonomously
monitoring various data sources for traces of attacks. However, IDSs are also
infamous for frequently raising false positives and alerts that are difficult
to interpret without context. This results in high workloads on security
operators who need to manually verify all reported alerts, often leading to
fatigue and incorrect decisions. To generate more meaningful alerts and
alleviate these issues, the research domain focused on multi-step attack
analysis proposes approaches for filtering, clustering, and correlating IDS
alerts, as well as generation of attack graphs. Unfortunately, existing data
sets are outdated, unreliable, narrowly focused, or only suitable for IDS
evaluation. Since hardly any suitable benchmark data sets are publicly
available, researchers often resort to private data sets that prevent
reproducibility of evaluations. We therefore generate a new alert data set that
we publish alongside this paper. The data set contains alerts from three
distinct IDSs monitoring eight executions of a multi-step attack as well as
simulations of normal user behavior. To illustrate the potential of our data
set, we experiment with alert prioritization as well as two open-source tools
for meta-alert generation and attack graph extraction.

<p class="mathjax">In temporal (or event-based) networks, time is a continuous axis, with
real-valued time coordinates for each node and edge. Computing a layout for
such graphs means embedding the node trajectories and edge surfaces over time
in a 2D + t space, known as the space-time cube. Currently, these space-time
cube layouts are visualized through animation or by slicing the cube at regular
intervals. However, both techniques present problems ranging from sub-par
performance on some tasks to loss of precision. In this paper, we present
TimeLighting, a novel visual analytics approach to visualize and explore
temporal graphs embedded in the space-time cube. Our interactive approach
highlights the node trajectories and their mobility over time, visualizes node
"aging", and provides guidance to support users during exploration. We evaluate
our approach through two case studies, showing the system's efficacy in
identifying temporal patterns and the role of the guidance features in the
exploration process.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel targetless method for joint intrinsic and
extrinsic calibration of LiDAR-camera systems using plane-constrained bundle
adjustment (BA). Our method leverages LiDAR point cloud measurements from
planes in the scene, alongside visual points derived from those planes. The
core novelty of our method lies in the integration of visual BA with the
registration between visual points and LiDAR point cloud planes, which is
formulated as a unified optimization problem. This formulation achieves
concurrent intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, while also imparting depth
constraints to the visual points to enhance the accuracy of intrinsic
calibration. Experiments are conducted on both public data sequences and
self-collected dataset. The results showcase that our approach not only
surpasses other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also maintains remarkable
calibration accuracy even within challenging environments. For the benefits of
the robotics community, we have open sourced our codes.

<p class="mathjax">The classification of gigapixel histopathology images with deep multiple
instance learning models has become a critical task in digital pathology and
precision medicine. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based multiple
instance learning approach that replaces the traditional learned attention
mechanism with a regional, Vision Transformer inspired self-attention
mechanism. We present a method that fuses regional patch information to derive
slide-level predictions and show how this regional aggregation can be stacked
to hierarchically process features on different distance levels. To increase
predictive accuracy, especially for datasets with small, local morphological
features, we introduce a method to focus the image processing on high attention
regions during inference. Our approach is able to significantly improve
performance over the baseline on two histopathology datasets and points towards
promising directions for further research.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language pre-training models (VLP) are vulnerable, especially to
multimodal adversarial samples, which can be crafted by adding imperceptible
perturbations on both original images and texts. However, under the black-box
setting, there have been no works to explore the transferability of multimodal
adversarial attacks against the VLP models. In this work, we take CLIP as the
surrogate model and propose a gradient-based multimodal attack method to
generate transferable adversarial samples against the VLP models. By applying
the gradient to optimize the adversarial images and adversarial texts
simultaneously, our method can better search for and attack the vulnerable
images and text information pairs. To improve the transferability of the
attack, we utilize contrastive learning including image-text contrastive
learning and intra-modal contrastive learning to have a more generalized
understanding of the underlying data distribution and mitigate the overfitting
of the surrogate model so that the generated multimodal adversarial samples
have a higher transferability for VLP models. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Currently, digital avatars can be created manually using human images as
reference. Systems such as Bitmoji are excellent producers of detailed avatar
designs, with hundreds of choices for customization. A supervised learning
model could be trained to generate avatars automatically, but the hundreds of
possible options create difficulty in securing non-noisy data to train a model.
As a solution, we train a model to produce avatars from human images using
tag-based annotations. This method provides better annotator agreement, leading
to less noisy data and higher quality model predictions. Our contribution is an
application of tag-based annotation to train a model for avatar face creation.
We design tags for 3 different facial facial features offered by Bitmoji, and
train a model using tag-based annotation to predict the nose.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper I propose a new way of measuring linguistic productivity that
objectively assesses the ability of an affix to be used to coin new complex
words and, unlike other popular measures, is not directly dependent upon token
frequency. Specifically, I suggest that linguistic productivity may be viewed
as the probability of an affix to combine with a random base. The advantages of
this approach include the following. First, token frequency does not dominate
the productivity measure but naturally influences the sampling of bases.
Second, we are not just counting attested word types with an affix but rather
simulating the construction of these types and then checking whether they are
attested in the corpus. Third, a corpus-based approach and randomised design
assure that true neologisms and words coined long ago have equal chances to be
selected. The proposed algorithm is evaluated both on English and Russian data.
The obtained results provide some valuable insights into the relation of
linguistic productivity to the number of types and tokens. It looks like
burgeoning linguistic productivity manifests itself in an increasing number of
types. However, this process unfolds in two stages: first comes the increase in
high-frequency items, and only then follows the increase in low-frequency
items.

<p class="mathjax">Many real-world optimization problems possess dynamic characteristics.
Evolutionary dynamic optimization algorithms (EDOAs) aim to tackle the
challenges associated with dynamic optimization problems. Looking at the
existing works, the results reported for a given EDOA can sometimes be
considerably different. This issue occurs because the source codes of many
EDOAs, which are usually very complex algorithms, have not been made publicly
available. Indeed, the complexity of components and mechanisms used in many
EDOAs makes their re-implementation error-prone. In this paper, to assist
researchers in performing experiments and comparing their algorithms against
several EDOAs, we develop an open-source MATLAB platform for EDOAs, called
Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization LABoratory (EDOLAB). This platform also
contains an education module that can be used for educational purposes. In the
education module, the user can observe a) a 2-dimensional problem space and how
its morphology changes after each environmental change, b) the behaviors of
individuals over time, and c) how the EDOA reacts to environmental changes and
tries to track the moving optimum. In addition to being useful for research and
education purposes, EDOLAB can also be used by practitioners to solve their
real-world problems. The current version of EDOLAB includes 25 EDOAs and three
fully-parametric benchmark generators. The MATLAB source code for EDOLAB is
publicly available and can be accessed from
[https://github.com/EDOLAB-platform/EDOLAB-MATLAB].

<p class="mathjax">The CoachAI Badminton 2023 Track1 initiative aim to automatically detect
events within badminton match videos. Detecting small objects, especially the
shuttlecock, is of quite importance and demands high precision within the
challenge. Such detection is crucial for tasks like hit count, hitting time,
and hitting location. However, even after revising the well-regarded
shuttlecock detecting model, TrackNet, our object detection models still fall
short of the desired accuracy. To address this issue, we've implemented various
deep learning methods to tackle the problems arising from noisy detectied data,
leveraging diverse data types to improve precision. In this report, we detail
the detection model modifications we've made and our approach to the 11 tasks.
Notably, our system garnered a score of 0.78 out of 1.0 in the challenge.

<p class="mathjax">This paper reports on the GENEA Challenge 2023, in which participating teams
built speech-driven gesture-generation systems using the same speech and motion
dataset, followed by a joint evaluation. This year's challenge provided data on
both sides of a dyadic interaction, allowing teams to generate full-body motion
for an agent given its speech (text and audio) and the speech and motion of the
interlocutor. We evaluated 12 submissions and 2 baselines together with
held-out motion-capture data in several large-scale user studies. The studies
focused on three aspects: 1) the human-likeness of the motion, 2) the
appropriateness of the motion for the agent's own speech whilst controlling for
the human-likeness of the motion, and 3) the appropriateness of the motion for
the behaviour of the interlocutor in the interaction, using a setup that
controls for both the human-likeness of the motion and the agent's own speech.
We found a large span in human-likeness between challenge submissions, with a
few systems rated close to human mocap. Appropriateness seems far from being
solved, with most submissions performing in a narrow range slightly above
chance, far behind natural motion. The effect of the interlocutor is even more
subtle, with submitted systems at best performing barely above chance.
Interestingly, a dyadic system being highly appropriate for agent speech does
not necessarily imply high appropriateness for the interlocutor. Additional

<p class="mathjax">Evolutionary computing (EC) is widely used in dealing with combinatorial
optimization problems (COP). Traditional EC methods can only solve a single
task in a single run, while real-life scenarios often need to solve multiple
COPs simultaneously. In recent years, evolutionary multitasking optimization
(EMTO) has become an emerging topic in the EC community. And many methods have
been designed to deal with multiple COPs concurrently through exchanging
knowledge. However, many-task optimization, cross-domain knowledge transfer,
and negative transfer are still significant challenges in this field. A new
evolutionary multitasking algorithm based on adaptive seed transfer (MTEA-AST)
is developed for multitasking COPs in this work. First, a dimension unification
strategy is proposed to unify the dimensions of different tasks. And then, an
adaptive task selection strategy is designed to capture the similarity between
the target task and other online optimization tasks. The calculated similarity
is exploited to select suitable source tasks for the target one and determine
the transfer strength. Next, a task transfer strategy is established to select
seeds from source tasks and correct unsuitable knowledge in seeds to suppress
negative transfer. Finally, the experimental results indicate that MTEA-AST can
adaptively transfer knowledge in both same-domain and cross-domain many-task
environments. And the proposed method shows competitive performance compared to
other state-of-the-art EMTOs in experiments consisting of four COPs.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is a crucial task for building
human-like conversational agents. While substantial efforts have been devoted
to ERC for chit-chat dialogues, the task-oriented counterpart is largely left
unattended. Directly applying chit-chat ERC models to task-oriented dialogues
(ToDs) results in suboptimal performance as these models overlook key features
such as the correlation between emotions and task completion in ToDs. In this
paper, we propose a framework that turns a chit-chat ERC model into a
task-oriented one, addressing three critical aspects: data, features and
objective. First, we devise two ways of augmenting rare emotions to improve ERC
performance. Second, we use dialogue states as auxiliary features to
incorporate key information from the goal of the user. Lastly, we leverage a
multi-aspect emotion definition in ToDs to devise a multi-task learning
objective and a novel emotion-distance weighted loss function. Our framework
yields significant improvements for a range of chit-chat ERC models on EmoWOZ,
a large-scale dataset for user emotion in ToDs. We further investigate the
generalisability of the best resulting model to predict user satisfaction in
different ToD datasets. A comparison with supervised baselines shows a strong
zero-shot capability, highlighting the potential usage of our framework in
wider scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">We study diverse skill discovery in reward-free environments, aiming to
discover all possible skills in simple grid-world environments where prior
methods have struggled to succeed. This problem is formulated as mutual
training of skills using an intrinsic reward and a discriminator trained to
predict a skill given its trajectory. Our initial solution replaces the
standard one-vs-all (softmax) discriminator with a one-vs-one (all pairs)
discriminator and combines it with a novel intrinsic reward function and a
dropout regularization technique. The combined approach is named APART: Diverse
Skill Discovery using All Pairs with Ascending Reward and Dropout. We
demonstrate that APART discovers all the possible skills in grid worlds with
remarkably fewer samples than previous works. Motivated by the empirical
success of APART, we further investigate an even simpler algorithm that
achieves maximum skills by altering VIC, rescaling its intrinsic reward, and
tuning the temperature of its softmax discriminator. We believe our findings
shed light on the crucial factors underlying success of skill discovery
algorithms in reinforcement learning.

<p class="mathjax">A dynamic flow network consists of a directed graph, where nodes called
sources represent locations of evacuees, and nodes called sinks represent
locations of evacuation facilities. Each source and each sink are given supply
representing the number of evacuees and demand representing the maximum number
of acceptable evacuees, respectively. Each edge is given capacity and transit
time. Here, the capacity of an edge bounds the rate at which evacuees can enter
the edge per unit time, and the transit time represents the time which evacuees
take to travel across the edge. The evacuation completion time is the minimum
time at which each evacuees can arrive at one of the evacuation facilities.
Given a dynamic flow network without sinks, once sinks are located on some
nodes or edges, the evacuation completion time for this sink location is
determined. We then consider the problem of locating sinks to minimize the
evacuation completion time, called the sink location problem. The problems have
been given polynomial-time algorithms only for limited networks such as paths,
cycles, and trees, but no polynomial-time algorithms are known for more complex
network classes. In this paper, we prove that the 1-sink location problem can
be solved in polynomial-time when an input network is a grid with uniform edge
capacity and transit time.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the Shortest Odd Path problem, where given an undirected graph
$G$, a weight function on its edges, and two vertices $s$ and $t$ in $G$, the
aim is to find an $(s,t)$-path with odd length and, among all such paths, of
minimum weight. For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e.,
when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest
Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be
NP-hard. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the
weight function is conservative and the set $E^-$ of negative-weight edges
forms a single tree. Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between
Shortest Odd Path and the problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint
paths between two terminals in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also
relies on solving an intermediary problem variant called Shortest
Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain edges we have parity constraints
on their position along the path. Also, we exhibit two FPT algorithms for
solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative weight functions. The
first FPT algorithm is parameterized by $|E^-|$, the number of negative edges,
or more generally, by the maximum size of a matching in the subgraph of $G$
spanned by $E^-$. Our second FPT algorithm is parameterized by the treewidth of
$G$.

<p class="mathjax">Binary Code Embedding (BCE) has important applications in various reverse
engineering tasks such as binary code similarity detection, type recovery,
control-flow recovery and data-flow analysis. Recent studies have shown that
the Transformer model can comprehend the semantics of binary code to support
downstream tasks. However, existing models overlooked the prior knowledge of
assembly language. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based
approach, namely kTrans, to generate knowledge-aware binary code embedding. By
feeding explicit knowledge as additional inputs to the Transformer, and fusing
implicit knowledge with a novel pre-training task, kTrans provides a new
perspective to incorporating domain knowledge into a Transformer framework. We
inspect the generated embeddings with outlier detection and visualization, and
also apply kTrans to 3 downstream tasks: Binary Code Similarity Detection
(BCSD), Function Type Recovery (FTR) and Indirect Call Recognition (ICR).
Evaluation results show that kTrans can generate high-quality binary code
embeddings, and outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on downstream
tasks by 5.2%, 6.8%, and 12.6% respectively. kTrans is publicly available at:

<p class="mathjax">Assessing the robustness of deep neural networks against out-of-distribution
inputs is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous
driving, but also in safety systems where malicious actors can digitally alter
inputs to circumvent safety guards. However, designing effective
out-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while
preserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing
methodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels
for attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic
robustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack
method based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet
avoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the
intensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we
demonstrate the attack's capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided
it is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then,
no full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the
attack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent
parameters. Defenses against other corruptions do not consistently extend to be
effective against our specific attack.

<p class="mathjax">In future B5G/6G broadband communication systems, non-linear signal
distortion caused by the impairment of transmit power amplifier (PA) can
severely degrade the communication performance, especially when uplink users
share the wireless medium using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes.
This is because the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding
technique, used in NOMA, is incapable of eliminating the interference caused by
PA distortion. Consequently, each user's decoding process suffers from the
cumulative distortion noise of all uplink users. In this paper, we establish a
new and tractable PA distortion signal model based on real-world measurements,
where the distortion noise power is a polynomial function of PA transmit power
diverging from the oversimplified linear function commonly employed in existing
studies. Applying the proposed signal model, we characterize the capacity rate
region of multi-user uplink NOMA by optimizing the user transmit power. Our
findings reveal a significant contraction in the capacity region of NOMA,
attributable to polynomial distortion noise power. For practical engineering
applications, we formulate a general weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax)
problem under individual user rate constraints. We further propose an efficient
power control algorithm to attain the optimal performance. Numerical results
show that the optimal power control policy under the proposed non-linear PA
model achieves on average 13\% higher throughput compared to the policies
assuming an ideal linear PA model. Overall, our findings demonstrate the
importance of accurate PA distortion modeling to the performance of NOMA and
provide efficient optimal power control method accordingly.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce Masked Feature Modelling (MFM), a novel approach
for the unsupervised pre-training of a Graph Attention Network (GAT) block. MFM
utilizes a pretrained Visual Tokenizer to reconstruct masked features of
objects within a video, leveraging the MiniKinetics dataset. We then
incorporate the pre-trained GAT block into a state-of-the-art bottom-up
supervised video-event recognition architecture, ViGAT, to improve the model's
starting point and overall accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the YLI-MED
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MFM in improving event recognition
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) present strong general capabilities, and a
current compelling challenge is stimulating their specialized capabilities,
such as machine translation, through low-cost instruction tuning. The standard
instruction-following data is sequentially organized as the concatenation of an
instruction, an input, and a response. As the attention mechanism of LLMs has
limitations on local focus, LLMs tend to focus more on the words or sentences
nearby at each position. This leads to a high risk of instruction forgetting
during decoding. To alleviate the above issues, We propose SWIE
(Segment-Weighted Instruction Embedding) and an instruction-following dataset
OVERMISS. SWIE improves the model instruction understanding by adding a global
instruction representation on the following input and response representations.
OVERMISS improves model faithfulness by comparing over-translation and
miss-translation results with the correct translation. We apply our methods to
two main-stream open-source LLMs, BLOOM and LLaMA. The experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in translation performance with SWIE based
on BLOOMZ-3b, particularly in zero-shot and long text translations due to
reduced instruction forgetting risk. Additionally, OVERMISS outperforms the
baseline in translation performance (e.g. an increase in BLEU scores from 0.69
to 3.12 and an average improvement of 0.48 percentage comet scores for
LLaMA-7b) with further enhancements seen in models combining OVERMISS and SWIE
(e.g. the BLUE scores increase up to 0.56 from English to German across three
different backbones), and both exhibit improvements in the faithfulness metric
based on word alignment.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) subtypes is crucial
for clinical decision-making and patient care. In this study, we investigate
the potential presence of age and sex bias in AML subtype classification using
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) architectures. To that end, we train multiple
MIL models using different levels of sex imbalance in the training set and
excluding certain age groups. To assess the sex bias, we evaluate the
performance of the models on male and female test sets. For age bias, models
are tested against underrepresented age groups in the training data. We find a
significant effect of sex and age bias on the performance of the model for AML
subtype classification. Specifically, we observe that females are more likely
to be affected by sex imbalance dataset and certain age groups, such as
patients with 72 to 86 years of age with the RUNX1::RUNX1T1 genetic subtype,
are significantly affected by an age bias present in the training data.
Ensuring inclusivity in the training data is thus essential for generating
reliable and equitable outcomes in AML genetic subtype classification,
ultimately benefiting diverse patient populations.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate classification of white blood cells in peripheral blood is essential
for diagnosing hematological diseases. Due to constantly evolving clinical
settings, data sources, and disease classifications, it is necessary to update
machine learning classification models regularly for practical real-world use.
Such models significantly benefit from sequentially learning from incoming data
streams without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, models can
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, causing a drop in performance on previous
tasks when fine-tuned on new data. Here, we propose a rehearsal-based continual
learning approach for class incremental and domain incremental scenarios in
white blood cell classification. To choose representative samples from previous
tasks, we employ exemplar set selection based on the model's predictions. This
involves selecting the most confident samples and the most challenging samples
identified through uncertainty estimation of the model. We thoroughly evaluated
our proposed approach on three white blood cell classification datasets that
differ in color, resolution, and class composition, including scenarios where
new domains or new classes are introduced to the model with every task. We also
test a long class incremental experiment with both new domains and new classes.
Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in
continual learning, including existing iCaRL and EWC methods for classifying
white blood cells in cross-domain environments.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel master-slave architecture to solve the top-$K$
combinatorial multi-armed bandits problem with non-linear bandit feedback and
diversity constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
combinatorial bandits setting considering diversity constraints under bandit
feedback. Specifically, to efficiently explore the combinatorial and
constrained action space, we introduce six slave models with distinguished
merits to generate diversified samples well balancing rewards and constraints
as well as efficiency. Moreover, we propose teacher learning based optimization
and the policy co-training technique to boost the performance of the multiple
slave models. The master model then collects the elite samples provided by the
slave models and selects the best sample estimated by a neural contextual
UCB-based network to make a decision with a trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. Thanks to the elaborate design of slave models, the co-training
mechanism among slave models, and the novel interactions between the master and
slave models, our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
algorithms in both synthetic and real datasets for recommendation tasks. The

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach for training machine learning
models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. The need for privacy
protection makes it difficult for FL models to achieve global transparency and
explainability. To address this limitation, we incorporate logic-based
explanations into FL by proposing the Logical Reasoning-based eXplainable
Federated Learning (LR-XFL) approach. Under LR-XFL, FL clients create local
logic rules based on their local data and send them, along with model updates,
to the FL server. The FL server connects the local logic rules through a proper
logical connector that is derived based on properties of client data, without
requiring access to the raw data. In addition, the server also aggregates the
local model updates with weight values determined by the quality of the
clients' local data as reflected by their uploaded logic rules. The results
show that LR-XFL outperforms the most relevant baseline by 1.19%, 5.81% and
5.41% in terms of classification accuracy, rule accuracy and rule fidelity,
respectively. The explicit rule evaluation and expression under LR-XFL enable
human experts to validate and correct the rules on the server side, hence
improving the global FL model's robustness to errors. It has the potential to
enhance the transparency of FL models for areas like healthcare and finance
where both data privacy and explainability are important.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive planning abilities
due to their vast "world knowledge". Yet, obtaining plans that are both
feasible (grounded in affordances) and cost-effective (in plan length), remains
a challenge, despite recent progress. This contrasts with heuristic planning
methods that employ domain knowledge (formalized in action models such as PDDL)
and heuristic search to generate feasible, optimal plans. Inspired by this, we
propose to combine the power of LLMs and heuristic planning by leveraging the
world knowledge of LLMs and the principles of heuristic search. Our approach,
SayCanPay, employs LLMs to generate actions (Say) guided by learnable domain
knowledge, that evaluates actions' feasibility (Can) and long-term
reward/payoff (Pay), and heuristic search to select the best sequence of
actions. Our contributions are (1) a novel framing of the LLM planning problem
in the context of heuristic planning, (2) integrating grounding and
cost-effective elements into the generated plans, and (3) using heuristic
search over actions. Our extensive evaluations show that our model surpasses
other LLM planning approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Topologically interlocked structures are assemblies of interlocking blocks
that hold together solely through contact. Such structures have been shown to
exhibit high strength, energy dissipation, and crack arrest properties. Recent
studies on beam-like topologically interlocked structures have shown that, with
non-planar blocks, it is possible to reach levels of strength and
work-to-failure which are otherwise possible only with unrealistically high
friction coefficients. While non-planar blocks have been extensively used for
slab-like assemblies, many questions in that context are still not fully
understood. Specifically, it is unclear what are the exact characteristics of
non-planar surface morphologies which can potentially improve the enhanced
mechanical response of slab-like assemblies. In addition, it is unclear if
slab-like structures with non-planar surface blocks can reach a saturated
response with realistic friction coefficient values, as is the case with
beam-like ones. Here, we investigate such fundamental questions using numerical
simulations. We show that, by using non-planar blocks, it is possible to reach
saturation to the response capacity of the structure with a realistic friction
coefficient. Furthermore, we show that the key morphology parameter responsible
for the enhanced performance is the local angle of inclination at the top of
the loaded block. Lastly, we show that non-planar morphologies lead to improved
work-to-failure and ultimate deflection, which cannot be attained with
planar-faced blocks. These findings shed new light on topologically interlocked
structures with non-planar blocks, allowing for a better understanding of their
strengths and potential applications.

<p class="mathjax">While large volumes of unlabeled data are usually available, associated
labels are often scarce. The unsupervised domain adaptation problem aims at
exploiting labels from a source domain to classify data from a related, yet
different, target domain. When time series are at stake, new difficulties arise
as temporal shifts may appear in addition to the standard feature distribution
shift. In this paper, we introduce the Match-And-Deform (MAD) approach that
aims at finding correspondences between the source and target time series while
allowing temporal distortions. The associated optimization problem
simultaneously aligns the series thanks to an optimal transport loss and the
time stamps through dynamic time warping. When embedded into a deep neural
network, MAD helps learning new representations of time series that both align
the domains and maximize the discriminative power of the network. Empirical
studies on benchmark datasets and remote sensing data demonstrate that MAD
makes meaningful sample-to-sample pairing and time shift estimation, reaching
similar or better classification performance than state-of-the-art deep time
series domain adaptation strategies.

methods has the potential to greatly scale biodiversity monitoring efforts. The
use of ML for high-stakes applications, such as conservation research, demands
a data-centric approach with a focus on utilizing carefully annotated and
curated evaluation and training data that is relevant and representative.
Creating annotated datasets of sound recordings presents a number of
challenges, such as managing large collections of recordings with associated
metadata, developing flexible annotation tools that can accommodate the diverse
range of vocalization profiles of different organisms, and addressing the
scarcity of expert annotators.
<br />2. We present Whombat a user-friendly, browser-based interface for managing
audio recordings and annotation projects, with several visualization,
exploration, and annotation tools. It enables users to quickly annotate,
review, and share annotations, as well as visualize and evaluate a set of
machine learning predictions on a dataset. The tool facilitates an iterative
workflow where user annotations and machine learning predictions feedback to
enhance model performance and annotation quality.
<br />3. We demonstrate the flexibility of Whombat by showcasing two distinct use
cases: an project aimed at enhancing automated UK bat call identification at
the Bat Conservation Trust (BCT), and a collaborative effort among the USDA
Forest Service and Oregon State University researchers exploring bioacoustic
applications and extending automated avian classification models in the Pacific
Northwest, USA.
<br />4. Whombat is a flexible tool that can effectively address the challenges of
annotation for bioacoustic research. It can be used for individual and
collaborative work, hosted on a shared server or accessed remotely, or run on a

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a new data analysis method for big data using a newly
defined regression model named multiple model linear regression(MMLR), which
separates input datasets into subsets and construct local linear regression
models of them. The proposed data analysis method is shown to be more efficient
and flexible than other regression based methods. This paper also proposes an
approximate algorithm to construct MMLR models based on
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-estimator, and gives mathematical proofs of the correctness
and efficiency of MMLR algorithm, of which the time complexity is linear with
respect to the size of input datasets. This paper also empirically implements
the method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, the algorithm shows to
have comparable performance to existing regression methods in many cases, while
it takes almost the shortest time to provide a high prediction accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">We propose TopDis (Topological Disentanglement), a method for learning
disentangled representations via adding multi-scale topological loss term.
Disentanglement is a crucial property of data representations substantial for
the explainability and robustness of deep learning models and a step towards
high-level cognition. The state-of-the-art method based on VAE minimizes the
total correlation of the joint distribution of latent variables. We take a
different perspective on disentanglement by analyzing topological properties of
data manifolds. In particular, we optimize the topological similarity for data
manifolds traversals. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first one
to propose a differentiable topological loss for disentanglement. Our
experiments have shown that the proposed topological loss improves
disentanglement scores such as MIG, FactorVAE score, SAP score and DCI
disentanglement score with respect to state-of-the-art results. Our method
works in an unsupervised manner, permitting to apply it for problems without
labeled factors of variation. Additionally, we show how to use the proposed
topological loss to find disentangled directions in a trained GAN.

<p class="mathjax">With the increase in software vulnerabilities that cause significant economic
and social losses, automatic vulnerability detection has become essential in
software development and maintenance. Recently, large language models (LLMs)
like GPT have received considerable attention due to their stunning
intelligence, and some studies consider using ChatGPT for vulnerability
detection. However, they do not fully consider the characteristics of LLMs,
since their designed questions to ChatGPT are simple without a specific prompt
design tailored for vulnerability detection. This paper launches a study on the
performance of software vulnerability detection using ChatGPT with different
prompt designs. Firstly, we complement previous work by applying various
improvements to the basic prompt. Moreover, we incorporate structural and
sequential auxiliary information to improve the prompt design. Besides, we
leverage ChatGPT's ability of memorizing multi-round dialogue to design
suitable prompts for vulnerability detection. We conduct extensive experiments
on two vulnerability datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of
prompt-enhanced vulnerability detection using ChatGPT. We also analyze the
merit and demerit of using ChatGPT for vulnerability detection.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale simulation with realistic nonlinear dynamic models is crucial for
algorithms development for swarm robotics. However, existing platforms are
mainly developed based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and either use
simple kinematic models to pursue a large number of simulating nodes or
implement realistic dynamic models with limited simulating nodes. In this
paper, we develop a simulator based on Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) that
utilizes GPU parallel computing to achieve large-scale swarm robotic
simulations. Specifically, we use a multi-process approach to simulate
heterogeneous agents and leverage PyTorch with GPU to simulate homogeneous
agents with a large number. We test our approach using a nonlinear quadrotor
model and demonstrate that this DOP approach can maintain almost the same
computational speed when quadrotors are less than 5,000. We also provide two
examples to present the functionality of the platform.

<p class="mathjax">Creating layouts is a fundamental step in graphic design. In this work, we
propose to use text as the guidance to create graphic layouts, i.e.,
Text-to-Layout, aiming to lower the design barriers. Text-to-Layout is a
challenging task, because it needs to consider the implicit, combined, and
incomplete layout constraints from text, each of which has not been studied in
previous work. To address this, we present a two-stage approach, named
parse-then-place. The approach introduces an intermediate representation (IR)
between text and layout to represent diverse layout constraints. With IR,
Text-to-Layout is decomposed into a parse stage and a place stage. The parse
stage takes a textual description as input and generates an IR, in which the
implicit constraints from the text are transformed into explicit ones. The
place stage generates layouts based on the IR. To model combined and incomplete
constraints, we use a Transformer-based layout generation model and carefully
design a way to represent constraints and layouts as sequences. Besides, we
adopt the pretrain-then-finetune strategy to boost the performance of the
layout generation model with large-scale unlabeled layouts. To evaluate our
approach, we construct two Text-to-Layout datasets and conduct experiments on
them. Quantitative results, qualitative analysis, and user studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Proper naming of methods can make program code easier to understand, and thus
enhance software maintainability. Yet, developers may use inconsistent names
due to poor communication or a lack of familiarity with conventions within the
software development lifecycle. To address this issue, much research effort has
been invested into building automatic tools that can check for method name
inconsistency and recommend consistent names. However, existing datasets
generally do not provide precise details about why a method name was deemed
improper and required to be changed. Such information can give useful hints on
how to improve the recommendation of adequate method names. Accordingly, we
construct a sample method-naming benchmark, ReName4J, by matching name changes
with code reviews. We then present an empirical study on how state-of-the-art
techniques perform in detecting or recommending consistent and inconsistent
method names based on ReName4J. The main purpose of the study is to reveal a
different perspective based on reviewed names rather than proposing a complete
benchmark. We find that the existing techniques underperform on our
review-driven benchmark, both in inconsistent checking and the recommendation.
We further identify potential biases in the evaluation of existing techniques,
which future research should consider thoroughly.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been a shift in computing architectures, moving
away from centralized cloud computing towards decentralized edge and fog
computing. This shift is driven by factors such as the increasing volume of
data generated at the edge, the growing demand for real-time processing and
low-latency applications, and the need for improved privacy and data locality.
Although this new paradigm offers numerous advantages, it also introduces
significant security and reliability challenges. This paper aims to review the
architectures and technologies employed in fog computing and identify
opportunities for developing novel security assessment and security hardening
techniques. These techniques include secure configuration and debloating to
enhance the security of middleware, testing techniques to assess secure
communication mechanisms, and automated rehosting to speed up the security
testing of embedded firmware.

<p class="mathjax">Instruction tuning is instrumental in enabling Large Language Models~(LLMs)
to follow user instructions to complete various open-domain tasks. The success
of instruction tuning depends on the availability of high-quality instruction
data. Owing to the exorbitant cost and substandard quality of human annotation,
recent works have been deeply engaged in the exploration of the utilization of
powerful closed-source models to generate instruction data automatically.
However, these methods carry potential risks arising from the usage
requirements of powerful closed-source models, which strictly forbid the
utilization of their outputs to develop machine learning models. To deal with
this problem, in this work, we explore alternative approaches to generate
high-quality instruction data that do not rely on closed-source models. Our
exploration includes an investigation of various existing instruction
generation methods, culminating in the integration of the most efficient
variant with two novel strategies to enhance the quality further. Evaluation
results from two benchmarks and the GPT-4 model demonstrate the effectiveness
of our generated instruction data, which can outperform Alpaca, a method
reliant on closed-source models. We hope that more progress can be achieved in
generating high-quality instruction data without using closed-source models.

Search, named G2APS, which contains 31,770 images of 260,559 annotated bounding
boxes for 2,644 identities appearing in both of the UAVs and ground
surveillance cameras. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for
cross-platform intelligent surveillance applications, where the UAVs could work
as a powerful complement for the ground surveillance cameras. To more
realistically simulate the actual cross-platform Ground-to-Aerial surveillance
scenarios, the surveillance cameras are fixed about 2 meters above the ground,
while the UAVs capture videos of persons at different location, with a variety
of view-angles, flight attitudes and flight modes. Therefore, the dataset has
the following unique characteristics: 1) drastic view-angle changes between
query and gallery person images from cross-platform cameras; 2) diverse
resolutions, poses and views of the person images under 9 rich real-world

<p class="mathjax">The integration of visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) has
driven recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
the scarcity of high-quality instruction-tuning data for vision-language tasks
remains a challenge. The current leading paradigm, such as LLaVA, relies on
language-only GPT-4 to generate data, which requires pre-annotated image
captions and detection bounding boxes, suffering from understanding image
details. A practical solution to this problem would be to utilize the available
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate instruction data for
vision-language tasks. However, it's worth noting that the currently accessible
MLLMs are not as powerful as their LLM counterparts, as they tend to produce
inadequate responses and generate false information. As a solution for
addressing the current issue, this paper proposes the Visual Instruction
Generation and Correction (VIGC) framework that enables multimodal large
language models to generate instruction-tuning data and progressively enhance
its quality on-the-fly. Specifically, Visual Instruction Generation (VIG)
guides the vision-language model to generate diverse instruction-tuning data.
To ensure generation quality, Visual Instruction Correction (VIC) adopts an
iterative update mechanism to correct any inaccuracies in data produced by VIG,
effectively reducing the risk of hallucination. Leveraging the diverse,
high-quality data generated by VIGC, we finetune mainstream models and validate
data quality based on various evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate
that VIGC not only compensates for the shortcomings of language-only data
generation methods, but also effectively enhances the benchmark performance.
The models, datasets, and code will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the ability of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
to solve forward and inverse problems of contact mechanics for small
deformation elasticity. We deploy PINNs in a mixed-variable formulation
enhanced by output transformation to enforce Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions as hard constraints. Inequality constraints of contact problems,
namely Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) type conditions, are enforced as soft
constraints by incorporating them into the loss function during network
training. To formulate the loss function contribution of KKT constraints,
existing approaches applied to elastoplasticity problems are investigated and
we explore a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) function, namely
Fischer-Burmeister, which possesses advantageous characteristics in terms of
optimization. Based on the Hertzian contact problem, we show that PINNs can
serve as pure partial differential equation (PDE) solver, as data-enhanced
forward model, as inverse solver for parameter identification, and as
fast-to-evaluate surrogate model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of
choosing proper hyperparameters, e.g. loss weights, and a combination of Adam
and L-BFGS-B optimizers aiming for better results in terms of accuracy and
training time.

<p class="mathjax">This study proposes a coupled velocity model (CVM) that establishes the
relation between the orientation and velocity using their correlation, avoiding
that the existing extended object tracking (EOT) models treat them as two
independent quantities. As a result, CVM detects the mismatch between the prior
dynamic model and actual motion pattern to correct the filtering gain, and
simultaneously becomes a nonlinear and state-coupled model with multiplicative
noise. The study considers CVM to design a feasible distributed weighted least
squares (WLS) filter. The WLS criterion requires a linear state-space model
containing only additive noise about the estimated state. To meet the
requirement, we derive such two separate pseudo-linearized models by using the
first-order Taylor series expansion. The separation is merely in form, and the
estimates of interested states are embedded as parameters into each other's
model, which implies that their interdependency is still preserved in the
iterative operation of two linear filters. With the two models, we first
propose a centralized WLS filter by converting the measurements from all nodes
into a summation form. Then, a distributed consensus scheme, which directly
performs an inner iteration on the priors across different nodes, is proposed
to incorporate the cross-covariances between nodes. Under the consensus scheme,
a distributed WLS filter over a realistic network with ``naive'' node is
developed by proper weighting of the priors and measurements. Finally, the
performance of proposed filters in terms of accuracy, robustness, and
consistency is testified under different prior situations.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a viable approach to enhance a
player's experience in video games. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods have been employed for DDA in non-competitive games; nevertheless, they
rely solely on discrete state-action space with a small search space. In this
paper, we propose a continuous RL-based DDA methodology for a visual working
memory (VWM) game to handle the complex search space for the difficulty of
memorization. The proposed RL-based DDA tailors game difficulty based on the
player's score and game difficulty in the last trial. We defined a continuous
metric for the difficulty of memorization. Then, we consider the task
difficulty and the vector of difficulty-score as the RL's action and state,
respectively. We evaluated the proposed method through a within-subject
experiment involving 52 subjects. The proposed approach was compared with two
rule-based difficulty adjustment methods in terms of player's score and game
experience measured by a questionnaire. The proposed RL-based approach resulted
in a significantly better game experience in terms of competence, tension, and
negative and positive affect. Players also achieved higher scores and win
rates. Furthermore, the proposed RL-based DDA led to a significantly less
decline in the score in a 20-trial session.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis systems have shown great potential
in assisting radiologists with accurate and efficient medical image analysis.
This paper presents a novel approach for bone pathology localization and
classification in wrist X-ray images using a combination of YOLO (You Only Look
Once) and the Shifted Window Transformer (Swin) with a newly proposed block.
The proposed methodology addresses two critical challenges in wrist X-ray
analysis: accurate localization of bone pathologies and precise classification
of abnormalities. The YOLO framework is employed to detect and localize bone
pathologies, leveraging its real-time object detection capabilities.
Additionally, the Swin, a transformer-based module, is utilized to extract
contextual information from the localized regions of interest (ROIs) for
accurate classification.

<p class="mathjax">Customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction is essential for mobile game
publishers trying to optimize the advertising investment for each user
acquisition based on the estimated worth. In mobile games, deploying
microtransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which
attracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The
presence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV
prediction models, since game whales' purchase behaviours always exhibit varied
distribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open
up new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However,
little attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV
prediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV
prediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are
available, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose
ExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale
detection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep
neural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic
order in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high
spenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale
detector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV
experts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and
scenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders
modelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator
for two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task
relationships. The superiority of ExpLTV is further validated via extensive
experiments on three industrial datasets.

<p class="mathjax">There are growing implications surrounding generative AI in the speech domain
that enable voice cloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to
another. This technology poses a significant ethical threat and could lead to
breaches of privacy and misrepresentation, thus there is an urgent need for
real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. To
address the above emerging issues, the DEEP-VOICE dataset is generated in this
study, comprised of real human speech from eight well-known figures and their
speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.
Presenting as a binary classification problem of whether the speech is real or
AI-generated, statistical analysis of temporal audio features through t-testing
reveals that there are significantly different distributions. Hyperparameter
optimisation is implemented for machine learning models to identify the source
of speech. Following the training of 208 individual machine learning models
over 10-fold cross validation, it is found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting
model can achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.3% and can classify
speech in real-time, at around 0.004 milliseconds given one second of speech.
All data generated for this study is released publicly for future research on
AI speech detection.

<p class="mathjax">The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in the regulation of a broad range of
physiological, behavioural, and cognitive functions. However, despite its
importance, only a few small-scale neuroimaging studies have investigated its
substructures, likely due to the lack of fully automated segmentation tools to
address scalability and reproducibility issues of manual segmentation. While
the only previous attempt to automatically sub-segment the hypothalamus with a
neural network showed promise for 1.0 mm isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, there
is a need for an automated tool to sub-segment also high-resolutional (HiRes)
MR scans, as they are becoming widely available, and include structural detail
also from multi-modal MRI. We, therefore, introduce a novel, fast, and fully
automated deep learning method named HypVINN for sub-segmentation of the
hypothalamus and adjacent structures on 0.8 mm isotropic T1w and T2w brain MR
images that is robust to missing modalities. We extensively validate our model
with respect to segmentation accuracy, generalizability, in-session test-retest
reliability, and sensitivity to replicate hypothalamic volume effects (e.g.
sex-differences). The proposed method exhibits high segmentation performance
both for standalone T1w images as well as for T1w/T2w image pairs. Even with
the additional capability to accept flexible inputs, our model matches or
exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods with fixed inputs. We,
further, demonstrate the generalizability of our method in experiments with 1.0
mm MR scans from both the Rhineland Study and the UK Biobank. Finally, HypVINN
can perform the segmentation in less than a minute (GPU) and will be available
in the open source FastSurfer neuroimaging software suite, offering a
validated, efficient, and scalable solution for evaluating imaging-derived
phenotypes of the hypothalamus.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional neural networks excel in histopathological image
classification, yet their pixel-level focus hampers explainability. Conversely,
emerging graph convolutional networks spotlight cell-level features and medical
implications. However, limited by their shallowness and suboptimal use of
high-dimensional pixel data, GCNs underperform in multi-class histopathological
image classification. To make full use of pixel-level and cell-level features
dynamically, we propose an asymmetric co-training framework combining a deep
graph convolutional network and a convolutional neural network for multi-class
histopathological image classification. To improve the explainability of the
entire framework by embedding morphological and topological distribution of
cells, we build a 14-layer deep graph convolutional network to handle cell
graph data. For the further utilization and dynamic interactions between
pixel-level and cell-level information, we also design a co-training strategy
to integrate the two asymmetric branches. Notably, we collect a private
clinically acquired dataset termed LUAD7C, including seven subtypes of lung
adenocarcinoma, which is rare and more challenging. We evaluated our approach
on the private LUAD7C and public colorectal cancer datasets, showcasing its
superior performance, explainability, and generalizability in multi-class
histopathological image classification.

<p class="mathjax">Underwater object detection suffers from low detection performance because
the distance and wavelength dependent imaging process yield evident image
quality degradations such as haze-like effects, low visibility, and color
distortions. Therefore, we commit to resolving the issue of underwater object
detection with compounded environmental degradations. Typical approaches
attempt to develop sophisticated deep architecture to generate high-quality
images or features. However, these methods are only work for limited ranges
because imaging factors are either unstable, too sensitive, or compounded.
Unlike these approaches catering for high-quality images or features, this
paper seeks transferable prior knowledge from detector-friendly images. The
prior guides detectors removing degradations that interfere with detection. It
is based on statistical observations that, the heavily degraded regions of
detector-friendly (DFUI) and underwater images have evident feature
distribution gaps while the lightly degraded regions of them overlap each
other. Therefore, we propose a residual feature transference module (RFTM) to
learn a mapping between deep representations of the heavily degraded patches of
DFUI- and underwater- images, and make the mapping as a heavily degraded prior
(HDP) for underwater detection. Since the statistical properties are
independent to image content, HDP can be learned without the supervision of
semantic labels and plugged into popular CNNbased feature extraction networks
to improve their performance on underwater object detection. Without bells and
whistles, evaluations on URPC2020 and UODD show that our methods outperform
CNN-based detectors by a large margin. Our method with higher speeds and less
parameters still performs better than transformer-based detectors. Our code and
DFUI dataset can be found in

<p class="mathjax">An important application of Synthetic Biology is the engineering of the host
cell system to yield useful products. However, an increase in the scale of the
host system leads to huge design space and requires a large number of
validation trials with high experimental costs. A comprehensible machine
learning approach that efficiently explores the hypothesis space and guides
experimental design is urgently needed for the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL)
cycle of the host cell system. We introduce a novel machine learning framework
ILP-iML1515 based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that performs abductive
logical reasoning and actively learns from training examples. In contrast to
numerical models, ILP-iML1515 is built on comprehensible logical
representations of a genome-scale metabolic model and can update the model by
learning new logical structures from auxotrophic mutant trials. The ILP-iML1515
framework 1) allows high-throughput simulations and 2) actively selects
experiments that reduce the experimental cost of learning gene functions in
comparison to randomly selected experiments.

<p class="mathjax">With the meteoric rise of video-on-demand (VOD) platforms, users face the
challenge of sifting through an expansive sea of content to uncover shows that
closely match their preferences. To address this information overload dilemma,
VOD services have increasingly incorporated recommender systems powered by
algorithms that analyze user behavior and suggest personalized content.
However, a majority of existing recommender systems depend on explicit user
feedback in the form of ratings and reviews, which can be difficult and
time-consuming to collect at scale. This presents a key research gap, as
leveraging users' implicit feedback patterns could provide an alternative
avenue for building effective video recommendation models, circumventing the
need for explicit ratings. However, prior literature lacks sufficient
exploration into implicit feedback-based recommender systems, especially in the
context of modeling video viewing behavior. Therefore, this paper aims to
bridge this research gap by proposing a novel video recommendation technique
that relies solely on users' implicit feedback in the form of their content
viewing percentages.

<p class="mathjax">In this letter, the incremental stability of interconnected systems is
discussed. In particular, we consider an interconnection of switched nonlinear
systems. The incremental stability of the switched interconnected system is a
stronger property as compared to conventional stability. Guaranteeing such a
notion of stability for an overall interconnected nonlinear system is
challenging, even if individual subsystems are incrementally stable. Here,
preserving incremental stability for the interconnection is ensured with a set
of sufficient conditions. Contraction theory is used as a tool to achieve
incremental convergence. For the feedback interconnection, the small gain
characterisation is presented for the overall system's incremental stability.
The results are derived for a special case of feedback, i.e., cascade
interconnection. Matrix-measure-based conditions are presented, which are
computationally tractable. Two numerical examples are demonstrated and
supported with simulation results to verify the theoretical claims.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a method to determine whether a given article was entirely written
by a generative language model versus an alternative situation in which the
article includes some significant edits by a different author, possibly a
human. Our process involves many perplexity tests for the origin of individual
sentences or other text atoms, combining these multiple tests using Higher
Criticism (HC). As a by-product, the method identifies parts suspected to be
edited. The method is motivated by the convergence of the log-perplexity to the
cross-entropy rate and by a statistical model for edited text saying that
sentences are mostly generated by the language model, except perhaps for a few
sentences that might have originated via a different mechanism. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method using real data and analyze the factors
affecting its success. This analysis raises several interesting open challenges
whose resolution may improve the method's effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">In NFV networks, service functions (SFs) can be deployed on virtual machines
(VMs) across multiple domains and then form a service function chain (MSFC) for
end-to-end network service provision. However, any software component in a
VM-based MSFC must experience software aging issue after a long period of
operation. This paper quantitatively investigates the capability of proactive
rejuvenation techniques in reducing the damage of software aging on a VM-based
MSFC. We develop a semi-Markov model to capture the behaviors of SFs, VMs and
virtual machine monitors (VMMs) from software aging to recovery under the
condition that failure times and recovery times follow general distributions.
We derive the formulas for calculating the steady-state availability and
reliability of the VM-based MSFC composed of multiple SFs running on VMs hosted
by VMMs. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to identify potential
dependability bottlenecks.

<p class="mathjax">We study closed-form constructive interference based block-level precoding
(CI-BLP) for scene expansion in the downlink of multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) systems. We extend the analysis on CI-BLP to the case
where the number of symbol slots in a block is smaller than the number of user.
To this end, we mathematically prove the feasibility of using the
pseudo-inverse to express the closed-form expression of the CI-BLP optimal
precoding matrix. Building upon this, a quadratic programming (QP) optimization
on simplex is obtained without being limited by the relationship between the
number of symbol slots in a block and the number of users. We study the low
complexity algorithm of large scale QP problem. We first mathematically obtain
the rank of the quadratic coefficient matrix in the QP problem. Although the
iterative closed-form algorithm for QP problems in CI-based symbol-level
precoding (CI-SLP) can be used in certain scenarios, the complexity of the
iterative closed algorithm for large-scale QP problems is impractical. In
addition, we design a low complexity algorithm based on alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM), which can efficiently solve large-scale QP
problems. We further analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed
algorithm. Numerical results validate our analysis and the optimality of the
proposed algorithm, and further show that the proposed algorithm offers a
flexible performance-complexity tradeoff by limiting the maximum number of
iterations, which motivates the use of CI-BLP in practical wireless systems.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel data-driven motion in-betweening system to
reach target poses of characters by making use of phases variables learned by a
Periodic Autoencoder. Our approach utilizes a mixture-of-experts neural network
model, in which the phases cluster movements in both space and time with
different expert weights. Each generated set of weights then produces a
sequence of poses in an autoregressive manner between the current and target
state of the character. In addition, to satisfy poses which are manually
modified by the animators or where certain end effectors serve as constraints
to be reached by the animation, a learned bi-directional control scheme is
implemented to satisfy such constraints. The results demonstrate that using
phases for motion in-betweening tasks sharpen the interpolated movements, and
furthermore stabilizes the learning process. Moreover, using phases for motion
in-betweening tasks can also synthesize more challenging movements beyond
locomotion behaviors. Additionally, style control is enabled between given
target keyframes. Our proposed framework can compete with popular
state-of-the-art methods for motion in-betweening in terms of motion quality
and generalization, especially in the existence of long transition durations.
Our framework contributes to faster prototyping workflows for creating animated
character sequences, which is of enormous interest for the game and film
industry.

<p class="mathjax">The future of automated driving (AD) is rooted in the development of robust,
fair and explainable artificial intelligence methods. Upon request, automated
vehicles must be able to explain their decisions to the driver and the car
passengers, to the pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and potentially
to external auditors in case of accidents. However, nowadays, most explainable
methods still rely on quantitative analysis of the AD scene representations
captured by multiple sensors. This paper proposes a novel representation of AD
scenes, called Qualitative eXplainable Graph (QXG), dedicated to qualitative
spatiotemporal reasoning of long-term scenes. The construction of this graph
exploits the recent Qualitative Constraint Acquisition paradigm. Our
experimental results on NuScenes, an open real-world multi-modal dataset, show
that the qualitative eXplainable graph of an AD scene composed of 40 frames can
be computed in real-time and light in space storage which makes it a
potentially interesting tool for improved and more trustworthy perception and
control processes in AD.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we address the task of few-shot part segmentation, which aims
to segment the different parts of an unseen object using very few labeled
examples. It is found that leveraging the textual space of a powerful
pre-trained image-language model (such as CLIP) can be beneficial in learning
visual features. Therefore, we develop a novel method termed PartSeg for
few-shot part segmentation based on multimodal learning. Specifically, we
design a part-aware prompt learning method to generate part-specific prompts
that enable the CLIP model to better understand the concept of ``part'' and
fully utilize its textual space. Furthermore, since the concept of the same
part under different object categories is general, we establish relationships
between these parts during the prompt learning process. We conduct extensive
experiments on the PartImageNet and Pascal$\_$Part datasets, and the
experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">Evolutionary search-based techniques are commonly used for testing autonomous
robotic systems. However, these approaches often rely on computationally
expensive simulator-based models for test scenario evaluation. To improve the
computational efficiency of the search-based testing, we propose augmenting the
evolutionary search (ES) with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained using
surrogate rewards derived from domain knowledge. In our approach, known as
RIGAA (Reinforcement learning Informed Genetic Algorithm for Autonomous systems
testing), we first train an RL agent to learn useful constraints of the problem
and then use it to produce a certain part of the initial population of the
search algorithm. By incorporating an RL agent into the search process, we aim
to guide the algorithm towards promising regions of the search space from the
start, enabling more efficient exploration of the solution space. We evaluate
RIGAA on two case studies: maze generation for an autonomous ant robot and road
topology generation for an autonomous vehicle lane keeping assist system. In
both case studies, RIGAA converges faster to fitter solutions and produces a
better test suite (in terms of average test scenario fitness and diversity).
RIGAA also outperforms the state-of-the-art tools for vehicle lane keeping
assist system testing, such as AmbieGen and Frenetic.

<p class="mathjax">A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item
embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding
space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this
purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the
consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its
construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score
in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical
behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results
emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation,
which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings

<p class="mathjax">Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot voice synthesis have enabled imitating a
speaker's voice using just a few seconds of recording while maintaining a high
level of realism. Alongside its potential benefits, this powerful technology
introduces notable risks, including voice fraud and speaker impersonation.
Unlike the conventional approach of solely relying on passive methods for
detecting synthetic data, watermarking presents a proactive and robust defence
mechanism against these looming risks. This paper introduces an innovative
audio watermarking framework that encodes up to 32 bits of watermark within a
mere 1-second audio snippet. The watermark is imperceptible to human senses and
exhibits strong resilience against various attacks. It can serve as an
effective identifier for synthesized voices and holds potential for broader
applications in audio copyright protection. Moreover, this framework boasts
high flexibility, allowing for the combination of multiple watermark segments
to achieve heightened robustness and expanded capacity. Utilizing 10 to
20-second audio as the host, our approach demonstrates an average Bit Error
Rate (BER) of 0.48\% across ten common attacks, a remarkable reduction of over
2800\% in BER compared to the state-of-the-art watermarking tool. See

<p class="mathjax">Robot control using reinforcement learning has become popular, but its
learning process generally terminates halfway through an episode for safety and
time-saving reasons. This study addresses the problem of the most popular
exception handling that temporal-difference (TD) learning performs at such
termination. That is, by forcibly assuming zero value after termination,
unintentionally implicit underestimation or overestimation occurs, depending on
the reward design in the normal states. When the episode is terminated due to
task failure, the failure may be highly valued with the unintentional
overestimation, and the wrong policy may be acquired. Although this problem can
be avoided by paying attention to the reward design, it is essential in
practical use of TD learning to review the exception handling at termination.
This paper therefore proposes a method to intentionally underestimate the value
after termination to avoid learning failures due to the unintentional
overestimation. In addition, the degree of underestimation is adjusted
according to the degree of stationarity at termination, thereby preventing
excessive exploration due to the intentional underestimation. Simulations and
real robot experiments showed that the proposed method can stably obtain the
optimal policies for various tasks and reward designs.

<p class="mathjax">Enlightened by the big success of pre-training in natural language
processing, pre-trained models for programming languages have been widely used
to promote code intelligence in recent years. In particular, BERT has been used
for bug localization tasks and impressive results have been obtained. However,
these BERT-based bug localization techniques suffer from two issues. First, the
pre-trained BERT model on source code does not adequately capture the deep
semantics of program code. Second, the overall bug localization models neglect
the necessity of large-scale negative samples in contrastive learning for
representations of changesets and ignore the lexical similarity between bug
reports and changesets during similarity estimation. We address these two
issues by 1) proposing a novel directed, multiple-label code graph
representation named Semantic Flow Graph (SFG), which compactly and adequately
captures code semantics, 2) designing and training SemanticCodeBERT based on
SFG, and 3) designing a novel Hierarchical Momentum Contrastive Bug
Localization technique (HMCBL). Evaluation results show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in bug localization.

<p class="mathjax">The diversity in length constitutes a significant characteristic of text. Due
to the long-tail distribution of text lengths, most existing methods for scene
text recognition (STR) only work well on short or seen-length text, lacking the
capability of recognizing longer text or performing length extrapolation. This
is a crucial issue, since the lengths of the text to be recognized are usually
not given in advance in real-world applications, but it has not been adequately
investigated in previous works. Therefore, we propose in this paper a method
called Length-Insensitive Scene TExt Recognizer (LISTER), which remedies the
limitation regarding the robustness to various text lengths. Specifically, a
Neighbor Decoder is proposed to obtain accurate character attention maps with
the assistance of a novel neighbor matrix regardless of the text lengths.
Besides, a Feature Enhancement Module is devised to model the long-range
dependency with low computation cost, which is able to perform iterations with
the neighbor decoder to enhance the feature map progressively. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve effective length-insensitive scene
text recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LISTER
algorithm exhibits obvious superiority on long text recognition and the ability
for length extrapolation, while comparing favourably with the previous
state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks for STR (mainly short text).

<p class="mathjax">On-device recommender systems recently have garnered increasing attention due
to their advantages of providing prompt response and securing privacy. To stay
current with evolving user interests, cloud-based recommender systems are
periodically updated with new interaction data. However, on-device models
struggle to retrain themselves because of limited onboard computing resources.
As a solution, we consider the scenario where the model retraining occurs on
the server side and then the updated parameters are transferred to edge devices
via network communication. While this eliminates the need for local retraining,
it incurs a regular transfer of parameters that significantly taxes network
bandwidth. To mitigate this issue, we develop an efficient approach based on
compositional codes to compress the model update. This approach ensures the
on-device model is updated flexibly with minimal additional parameters whilst
utilizing previous knowledge. The extensive experiments conducted on multiple
session-based recommendation models with distinctive architectures demonstrate
that the on-device model can achieve comparable accuracy to the retrained
server-side counterpart through transferring an update 60x smaller in size. The
codes are available at \url{https://github.com/xiaxin1998/ODUpdate}.

<p class="mathjax">Prior work in 3D object detection evaluates models using offline metrics like
average precision since closed-loop online evaluation on the downstream driving
task is costly. However, it is unclear how indicative offline results are of
driving performance. In this work, we perform the first empirical evaluation
measuring how predictive different detection metrics are of driving performance
when detectors are integrated into a full self-driving stack. We conduct
extensive experiments on urban driving in the CARLA simulator using 16 object
detection models. We find that the nuScenes Detection Score has a higher
correlation to driving performance than the widely used average precision
metric. In addition, our results call for caution on the exclusive reliance on
the emerging class of `planner-centric' metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Given a square pencil $A+ \lambda B$, where $A$ and $B$ are complex matrices,
we consider the problem of finding the singular pencil nearest to it in the
Frobenius distance. This problem is known to be very difficult, and the few
algorithms available in the literature can only deal efficiently with pencils
of very small size. We show that the problem is equivalent to minimizing a
certain objective function over the Riemannian manifold $SU(n) \times SU(n)$,
where $SU(n)$ denotes the special unitary group. With minor modifications, the
same approach extends to the case of finding a nearest singular pencil with a
specified minimal index. This novel perspective is based on the generalized
Schur form of pencils, and yields a competitive numerical method, by pairing it
with an algorithm capable of doing optimization on a Riemannian manifold. We
provide numerical experiments that show that the resulting method allows us to
deal with pencils of much larger size than alternative techniques, yielding
candidate minimizers of comparable or better quality. In the course of our
analysis, we also obtain a number of new theoretical results related to the
generalized Schur form of a (regular or singular) square pencil and to the
minimal index of a singular square pencil whose nullity is $1$.

<p class="mathjax">Container technology, as the key enabler behind microservice architectures,
is widely applied in Cloud and Edge Computing. A long and continuous running of
operating system (OS) host-ing container-based services can encounter software
aging that leads to performance deterioration and even causes system fail-ures.
OS rejuvenation techniques can mitigate the impact of software aging but the
rejuvenation trigger interval needs to be carefully determined to reduce the
downtime cost due to rejuve-nation. This paper proposes a comprehensive
semi-Markov-based approach to quantitatively evaluate the effect of OS
reju-venation on the dependability and the performance of a con-tainer-based
service. In contrast to the existing studies, we nei-ther restrict the
distributions of time intervals of events to be exponential nor assume that
backup resources are always avail-able. Through the numerical study, we show
the optimal con-tainer-migration trigger intervals that can maximize the
de-pendability or minimize the performance of a container-based service.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (NNs) are known for their high-prediction performances.
However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering
completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian
variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide
uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.
The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time
because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC
dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast
as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to
analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout
signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,
softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN
without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We
evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy
example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our
single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the
uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC
approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show
that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble
techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.

<p class="mathjax">Writing logging messages is a well-established conventional programming
practice, and it is of vital importance for a wide variety of software
development activities. The logging mechanism in Solidity programming is
enabled by the high-level event feature, but up to now there lacks study for
understanding Solidity event logging practices in the wild. To fill this gap,
we in this paper provide the first quantitative characteristic study of the
current Solidity event logging practices using 2,915 popular Solidity projects
hosted on GitHub. The study methodically explores the pervasiveness of event
logging, the goodness of current event logging practices, and in particular the
reasons for event logging code evolution, and delivers 8 original and important
findings. The findings notably include the existence of a large percentage of
independent event logging code modifications, and the underlying reasons for
different categories of independent event logging code modifications are
diverse (for instance, bug fixing and gas saving). We additionally give the
implications of our findings, and these implications can enlighten developers,
researchers, tool builders, and language designers to improve the event logging
practices. To illustrate the potential benefits of our study, we develop a
proof-of-concept checker on top of one of our findings and the checker
effectively detects problematic event logging code that consumes extra gas in
35 popular GitHub projects and 9 project owners have already confirmed the
detected issues.

<p class="mathjax">Surgical context inference has recently garnered significant attention in
robot-assisted surgery as it can facilitate workflow analysis, skill
assessment, and error detection. However, runtime context inference is
challenging since it requires timely and accurate detection of the interactions
among the tools and objects in the surgical scene based on the segmentation of
video data. On the other hand, existing state-of-the-art video segmentation
methods are often biased against infrequent classes and fail to provide
temporal consistency for segmented masks. This can negatively impact the
context inference and accurate detection of critical states. In this study, we
propose a solution to these challenges using a Space Time Correspondence
Network (STCN). STCN is a memory network that performs binary segmentation and
minimizes the effects of class imbalance. The use of a memory bank in STCN
allows for the utilization of past image and segmentation information, thereby
ensuring consistency of the masks. Our experiments using the publicly available
JIGSAWS dataset demonstrate that STCN achieves superior segmentation
performance for objects that are difficult to segment, such as needle and
thread, and improves context inference compared to the state-of-the-art. We
also demonstrate that segmentation and context inference can be performed at
runtime without compromising performance.

<p class="mathjax">This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent
advancements and challenges in applying large language models to the field of
audio signal processing. Audio processing, with its diverse signal
representations and a wide range of sources--from human voices to musical
instruments and environmental sounds--poses challenges distinct from those
found in traditional Natural Language Processing scenarios. Nevertheless,
\textit{Large Audio Models}, epitomized by transformer-based architectures,
have shown marked efficacy in this sphere. By leveraging massive amount of
data, these models have demonstrated prowess in a variety of audio tasks,
spanning from Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech to Music
Generation, among others. Notably, recently these Foundational Audio Models,
like SeamlessM4T, have started showing abilities to act as universal
translators, supporting multiple speech tasks for up to 100 languages without
any reliance on separate task-specific systems. This paper presents an in-depth
analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies regarding \textit{Foundational Large
Audio Models}, their performance benchmarks, and their applicability to
real-world scenarios. We also highlight current limitations and provide
insights into potential future research directions in the realm of
\textit{Large Audio Models} with the intent to spark further discussion,
thereby fostering innovation in the next generation of audio-processing
systems. Furthermore, to cope with the rapid development in this area, we will
consistently update the relevant repository with relevant recent articles and
their open-source implementations at

<p class="mathjax">Digital twins for intelligent transportation systems are currently attracting
great interests, in which generating realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic
flow in simulations is a formidable challenge. Current approaches often hinge
on predefined driver models, objective optimization, or reliance on
pre-recorded driving datasets, imposing limitations on their scalability,
versatility, and adaptability. In this paper, we introduce TrafficMCTS, an
innovative framework that harnesses the synergy of groupbased Monte Carlo tree
search (MCTS) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) to engender a multifaceted
traffic flow replete with varying driving styles and cooperative tendencies.
Anchored by a closed-loop architecture, our framework enables vehicles to
dynamically adapt to their environment in real time, and ensure feasible
collision-free trajectories. Through comprehensive comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods, we illuminate the advantages of our approach in terms
of computational efficiency, planning success rate, intent completion time, and
diversity metrics. Besides, we simulate highway and roundabout scenarios to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and highlight its
ability to induce diverse social behaviors within the traffic flow. Finally, we
validate the scalability of TrafficMCTS by showcasing its prowess in
simultaneously mass vehicles within a sprawling road network, cultivating a
landscape of traffic flow that mirrors the intricacies of human behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Extensive bedside monitoring in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has resulted in
complex temporal data regarding patient physiology, which presents an upscale
context for clinical data analysis. In the other hand, identifying the
time-series patterns within these data may provide a high aptitude to predict
clinical events. Hence, we investigate, during this work, the implementation of
an automatic data-driven system, which analyzes large amounts of multivariate
temporal data derived from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and extracts
high-level information so as to predict in-hospital mortality and Length of
Stay (LOS) early. Practically, we investigate the applicability of LSTM network
by reducing the time-frame to 6-hour so as to enhance clinical tasks. The
experimental results highlight the efficiency of LSTM model with rigorous
multivariate time-series measurements for building real-world prediction
engines.

<p class="mathjax">The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects, curates, and manages data
related to cancer patients in Norway, supported by an interactive,
human-in-the-loop, socio-technical decision support software system. Automated
software testing of this software system is inevitable; however, currently, it
is limited in CRN's practice. To this end, we present an industrial case study
to evaluate an AI-based system-level testing tool, i.e., EvoMaster, in terms of
its effectiveness in testing CRN's software system. In particular, we focus on
GURI, CRN's medical rule engine, which is a key component at the CRN. We test
GURI with EvoMaster's black-box and white-box tools and study their test
effectiveness regarding code coverage, errors found, and domain-specific rule
coverage. The results show that all EvoMaster tools achieve a similar code
coverage; i.e., around 19% line, 13% branch, and 20% method; and find a similar
number of errors; i.e., 1 in GURI's code. Concerning domain-specific coverage,
EvoMaster's black-box tool is the most effective in generating tests that lead
to applied rules; i.e., 100% of the aggregation rules and between 12.86% and
25.81% of the validation rules; and to diverse rule execution results; i.e.,
86.84% to 89.95% of the aggregation rules and 0.93% to 1.72% of the validation
rules pass, and 1.70% to 3.12% of the aggregation rules and 1.58% to 3.74% of
the validation rules fail. We further observe that the results are consistent
across 10 versions of the rules. Based on these results, we recommend using
EvoMaster's black-box tool to test GURI since it provides good results and
advances the current state of practice at the CRN. Nonetheless, EvoMaster needs
to be extended to employ domain-specific optimization objectives to improve
test effectiveness further. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and
potential research directions, which we believe are generally applicable.

<p class="mathjax">The simulation of plasma physics is computationally expensive because the
underlying physical system is of high dimensions, requiring three spatial
dimensions and three velocity dimensions. One popular numerical approach is
Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods owing to its ease of implementation and
favorable scalability in high-dimensional problems. An unfortunate drawback of
the method is the introduction of statistical noise resulting from the use of
finitely many particles. In this paper we examine the application of the
Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC) family of convolution kernel
filters as denoisers for moment data arising from PIC simulations. We show that
SIAC filtering is a promising tool to denoise PIC data in the physical space as
well as capture the appropriate scales in the Fourier space. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how the application of the SIAC technique reduces the amount of
information necessary in the computation of quantities of interest in plasma
physics such as the Bohm speed.

<p class="mathjax">Software startup companies develop innovative, software-intensive products
within limited time frames and with few resources, searching for sustainable
and scalable business models. Software startups are quite distinct from
traditional mature software companies, but also from micro-, small-, and
medium-sized enterprises, introducing new challenges relevant for software
engineering research. This paper's research agenda focuses on software
engineering in startups, identifying, in particular, 70+ research questions in
the areas of supporting startup engineering activities, startup evolution
models and patterns, ecosystems and innovation hubs, human aspects in software
startups, applying startup concepts in non-startup environments, and
methodologies and theories for startup research. We connect and motivate this
research agenda with past studies in software startup research, while pointing
out possible future directions. While all authors of this research agenda have
their main background in Software Engineering or Computer Science, their
interest in software startups broadens the perspective to the challenges, but
also to the opportunities that emerge from multi-disciplinary research. Our
audience is therefore primarily software engineering researchers, even though
we aim at stimulating collaborations and research that crosses disciplinary
boundaries. We believe that with this research agenda we cover a wide spectrum
of the software startup industry current needs.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting small scene text instances in the wild is particularly challenging,
where the influence of irregular positions and nonideal lighting often leads to
detection errors. We present MixNet, a hybrid architecture that combines the
strengths of CNNs and Transformers, capable of accurately detecting small text
from challenging natural scenes, regardless of the orientations, styles, and
lighting conditions. MixNet incorporates two key modules: (1) the Feature
Shuffle Network (FSNet) to serve as the backbone and (2) the Central
Transformer Block (CTBlock) to exploit the 1D manifold constraint of the scene
text. We first introduce a novel feature shuffling strategy in FSNet to
facilitate the exchange of features across multiple scales, generating
high-resolution features superior to popular ResNet and HRNet. The FSNet
backbone has achieved significant improvements over many existing text
detection methods, including PAN, DB, and FAST. Then we design a complementary
CTBlock to leverage center line based features similar to the medial axis of
text regions and show that it can outperform contour-based approaches in
challenging cases when small scene texts appear closely. Extensive experimental
results show that MixNet, which mixes FSNet with CTBlock, achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text detection datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Intermittently powered devices rely on opportunistic energy-harvesting to
function, leading to recurrent power interruptions. This paper introduces DiCA,
a proposal for a hardware/software co-design to create differential
check-points in intermittent devices. DiCA leverages an affordable hardware
module that simplifies the check-pointing process, reducing the check-point
generation time and energy consumption. This hardware module continuously
monitors volatile memory, efficiently tracking modifications and determining
optimal check-point times. To minimize energy waste, the module dynamically
estimates the energy required to create and store the check-point based on
tracked memory modifications, triggering the check-pointing routine optimally
via a nonmaskable interrupt. Experimental results show the cost-effectiveness
and energy efficiency of DiCA, enabling extended application activity cycles in
intermittently powered embedded devices.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models are often used to decide who will receive a loan, a
job interview, or a public benefit. Standard techniques to build these models
use features about people but overlook their actionability. In turn, models can
assign predictions that are fixed, meaning that consumers who are denied loans,
interviews, or benefits may be permanently locked out from access to credit,
employment, or assistance. In this work, we introduce a formal testing
procedure to flag models that assign fixed predictions that we call recourse
verification. We develop machinery to reliably determine if a given model can
provide recourse to its decision subjects from a set of user-specified
actionability constraints. We demonstrate how our tools can ensure recourse and
adversarial robustness in real-world datasets and use them to study the
infeasibility of recourse in real-world lending datasets. Our results highlight
how models can inadvertently assign fixed predictions that permanently bar
access, and we provide tools to design algorithms that account for
actionability when developing models.

<p class="mathjax">Context and Motivation: Natural language is the most common form to specify
requirements in industry. The quality of the specification depends on the
capability of the writer to formulate requirements aimed at different
stakeholders: they are an expression of the customer's needs that are used by
analysts, designers and testers. Given this central role of requirements as a
mean to communicate intention, assuring their quality is essential to reduce
misunderstandings that lead to potential waste. Problem: Quality assurance of
requirement specifications is largely a manual effort that requires expertise
and domain knowledge. However, this demanding cognitive process is also
congested by trivial quality issues that should not occur in the first place.
Principal ideas: We propose a taxonomy of requirements quality assurance
complexity that characterizes cognitive load of verifying a quality aspect from
the human perspective, and automation complexity and accuracy from the machine
perspective. Contribution: Once this taxonomy is realized and validated, it can
serve as the basis for a decision framework of automated requirements quality
assurance support.

<p class="mathjax">Public transport routing plays a crucial role in transit network design,
ensuring a satisfactory level of service for passengers. However, current
routing solutions rely on traditional operational research heuristics, which
can be time-consuming to implement and lack the ability to provide quick
solutions. Here, we propose a novel deep learning-based methodology for a
decision support system that enables public transport (PT) planners to identify
short-term route improvements rapidly. By seamlessly adjusting specific
sections of routes between two stops during specific times of the day, our
method effectively reduces times and enhances PT services. Leveraging diverse
data sources such as GTFS and smart card data, we extract features and model
the transportation network as a directed graph. Using self-supervision, we
train a deep learning model for predicting lateness values for road segments.
<br />These lateness values are then utilized as edge weights in the transportation
graph, enabling efficient path searching. Through evaluating the method on Tel
Aviv, we are able to reduce times on more than 9\% of the routes. The improved
routes included both intraurban and suburban routes showcasing a fact
highlighting the model's versatility. The findings emphasize the potential of
our data-driven decision support system to enhance public transport and city
logistics, promoting greater efficiency and reliability in PT services.

<p class="mathjax">The portrait matting task aims to extract an alpha matte with complete
semantics and finely-detailed contours. In comparison to CNN-based approaches,
transformers with self-attention allow a larger receptive field, enabling it to
better capture long-range dependencies and low-frequency semantic information
of a portrait. However, the recent research shows that self-attention mechanism
struggle with modeling high-frequency information and capturing fine contour
details, which can lead to bias while predicting the portrait's contours. To
address the problem, we propose EFormer to enhance the model's attention
towards semantic and contour features. Especially the latter, which is
surrounded by a large amount of high-frequency details. We build a semantic and
contour detector (SCD) to accurately capture the distribution of semantic and
contour features. And we further design contour-edge extraction branch and
semantic extraction branch for refining contour features and complete semantic
information. Finally, we fuse the two kinds of features and leverage the
segmentation head to generate the predicted portrait matte. Remarkably, EFormer
is an end-to-end trimap-free method and boasts a simple structure. Experiments
conducted on VideoMatte240K-JPEGSD and AIM datasets demonstrate that EFormer
outperforms previous portrait matte methods.

drawn attention to safety- and security-related threats and vulnerabilities of
LLMs, including in the context of potentially criminal activities.
Specifically, it has been shown that LLMs can be misused for fraud,
impersonation, and the generation of malware; while other authors have
considered the more general problem of AI alignment. It is important that
developers and practitioners alike are aware of security-related problems with
such models. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing - predominantly
scientific - efforts on identifying and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities
arising from LLMs. We present a taxonomy describing the relationship between
threats caused by the generative capabilities of LLMs, prevention measures
intended to address such threats, and vulnerabilities arising from imperfect
prevention measures. With our work, we hope to raise awareness of the
limitations of LLMs in light of such security concerns, among both experienced
developers and novel users of such technologies.

<p class="mathjax">As large scale construction projects become increasingly complex, the use and
integration of advanced technologies are being emphasized more and more.
However, the construction industry often lags behind most industries in the
application of digital technologies. In recent years, a decentralized,
peer-topeer blockchain technology has attracted widespread attention from
academia and industry. This paper provides a solution that combines blockchain
technology with construction project fund management. The system involves
participants such as the owner's unit, construction companies, government
departments, banks, etc., adopting the technical architecture of the Xiong'an
Blockchain Underlying System. The core business and key logic processing are
all implemented through smart contracts, ensuring the transparency and
traceability of the fund payment process. The goal of ensuring investment
quality, standardizing investment behavior, and strengthening cost control is
achieved through blockchain technology. The application of this system in the
management of Xiong'an construction projects has verified that blockchain
technology plays a significant positive role in strengthening fund management,
enhancing fund supervision, and ensuring fund safety in the construction
process of engineering projects. It helps to eliminate the common problems of
multi-party trust and transparent supervision in the industry and can further
improve the investment benefits of government investment projects and improve
the management system and operation mechanism of investment projects.

<p class="mathjax">Through our respiratory system, many viruses and diseases frequently spread
and pass from one person to another. Covid-19 served as an example of how
crucial it is to track down and cut back on contacts to stop its spread. There
is a clear gap in finding automatic methods that can detect hand-to-face
contact in complex urban scenes or indoors. In this paper, we introduce a
computer vision framework, called FaceTouch, based on deep learning. It
comprises deep sub-models to detect humans and analyse their actions. FaceTouch
seeks to detect hand-to-face touches in the wild, such as through video chats,
bus footage, or CCTV feeds. Despite partial occlusion of faces, the introduced
system learns to detect face touches from the RGB representation of a given
scene by utilising the representation of the body gestures such as arm
movement. This has been demonstrated to be useful in complex urban scenarios
beyond simply identifying hand movement and its closeness to faces. Relying on
Supervised Contrastive Learning, the introduced model is trained on our
collected dataset, given the absence of other benchmark datasets. The framework
shows a strong validation in unseen datasets which opens the door for potential
deployment.

<p class="mathjax">Plagiarism detection is one of the most researched areas among the Natural
Language Processing(NLP) community. A good plagiarism detection covers all the
NLP methods including semantics, named entities, paraphrases etc. and produces
detailed plagiarism reports. Detection of Cross Lingual Plagiarism requires
deep knowledge of various advanced methods and algorithms to perform effective
text similarity checking. Nowadays the plagiarists are also advancing
themselves from hiding the identity from being catch in such offense. The
plagiarists are bypassed from being detected with techniques like paraphrasing,
synonym replacement, mismatching citations, translating one language to
another. Image Content Plagiarism Detection (ICPD) has gained importance,
utilizing advanced image content processing to identify instances of plagiarism
to ensure the integrity of image content. The issue of plagiarism extends
beyond textual content, as images such as figures, graphs, and tables also have
the potential to be plagiarized. However, image content plagiarism detection
remains an unaddressed challenge. Therefore, there is a critical need to
develop methods and systems for detecting plagiarism in image content. In this
paper, the system has been implemented to detect plagiarism form contents of
Images such as Figures, Graphs, Tables etc. Along with statistical algorithms
such as Jaccard and Cosine, introducing semantic algorithms such as LSA, BERT,
WordNet outperformed in detecting efficient and accurate plagiarism.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate the operation of an aerial manipulator system,
namely an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a controllable arm with
two degrees of freedom to carry out actuation tasks on the fly. Our solution is
based on employing a Q-learning method to control the trajectory of the tip of
the arm, also called \textit{end-effector}. More specifically, we develop a
motion planning model based on Time To Collision (TTC), which enables a
quadrotor UAV to navigate around obstacles while ensuring the manipulator's
reachability. Additionally, we utilize a model-based Q-learning model to
independently track and control the desired trajectory of the manipulator's
end-effector, given an arbitrary baseline trajectory for the UAV platform. Such
a combination enables a variety of actuation tasks such as high-altitude
welding, structural monitoring and repair, battery replacement, gutter
cleaning, sky scrapper cleaning, and power line maintenance in hard-to-reach
and risky environments while retaining compatibility with flight control
firmware. Our RL-based control mechanism results in a robust control strategy
that can handle uncertainties in the motion of the UAV, offering promising
performance. Specifically, our method achieves 92\% accuracy in terms of
average displacement error (i.e. the mean distance between the target and
obtained trajectory points) using Q-learning with 15,000 episodes

<p class="mathjax">Some applications of deep learning require not only to provide accurate
results but also to quantify the amount of confidence in their prediction. The
management of an electric power grid is one of these cases: to avoid risky
scenarios, decision-makers need both precise and reliable forecasts of, for
example, power loads. For this reason, point forecasts are not enough hence it
is necessary to adopt methods that provide an uncertainty quantification.
<br />This work focuses on reservoir computing as the core time series forecasting
method, due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness in predicting
time series. While the RC literature mostly focused on point forecasting, this
work explores the compatibility of some popular uncertainty quantification
methods with the reservoir setting. Both Bayesian and deterministic approaches
to uncertainty assessment are evaluated and compared in terms of their
prediction accuracy, computational resource efficiency and reliability of the
estimated uncertainty, based on a set of carefully chosen performance metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Robust obstacle avoidance is one of the critical steps for successful
goal-driven indoor navigation tasks.Due to the obstacle missing in the visual
image and the possible missed detection issue, visual image-based obstacle
avoidance techniques still suffer from unsatisfactory robustness. To mitigate
it, in this paper, we propose a novel implicit obstacle map-driven indoor
navigation framework for robust obstacle avoidance, where an implicit obstacle
map is learned based on the historical trial-and-error experience rather than
the visual image. In order to further improve the navigation efficiency, a
non-local target memory aggregation module is designed to leverage a non-local
network to model the intrinsic relationship between the target semantic and the
target orientation clues during the navigation process so as to mine the most
target-correlated object clues for the navigation decision. Extensive
experimental results on AI2-Thor and RoboTHOR benchmarks verify the excellent
obstacle avoidance and navigation efficiency of our proposed method. The core
source code is available at https://github.com/xwaiyy123/object-navigation.

<p class="mathjax">We examine the problem of estimating footprint uncertainty of objects imaged
using the infrastructure based camera sensing. A closed form relationship is
established between the ground coordinates and the sources of the camera
errors. Using the error propagation equation, the covariance of a given ground
coordinate can be measured as a function of the camera errors. The uncertainty
of the footprint of the bounding box can then be given as the function of all
the extreme points of the object footprint. In order to calculate the
uncertainty of a ground point, the typical error sizes of the error sources are
required. We present a method of estimating the typical error sizes from an
experiment using a static, high-precision LiDAR as the ground truth. Finally,
we present a simulated case study of uncertainty quantification from
infrastructure based camera in CARLA to provide a sense of how the uncertainty
changes across a left turn maneuver.

<p class="mathjax">Fast adversarial training (FAT) is beneficial for improving the adversarial
robustness of neural networks. However, previous FAT work has encountered a
significant issue known as catastrophic overfitting when dealing with large
perturbation budgets, \ie the adversarial robustness of models declines to near
zero during training.
<br />To address this, we analyze the training process of prior FAT work and
observe that catastrophic overfitting is accompanied by the appearance of loss
convergence outliers.
<br />Therefore, we argue a moderately smooth loss convergence process will be a
stable FAT process that solves catastrophic overfitting.
<br />To obtain a smooth loss convergence process, we propose a novel oscillatory
constraint (dubbed ConvergeSmooth) to limit the loss difference between
adjacent epochs. The convergence stride of ConvergeSmooth is introduced to
balance convergence and smoothing. Likewise, we design weight centralization
without introducing additional hyperparameters other than the loss balance
coefficient.
<br />Our proposed methods are attack-agnostic and thus can improve the training
stability of various FAT techniques.
<br />Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that the proposed methods
efficiently avoid catastrophic overfitting and outperform all previous FAT
methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/FAT-CS/ConvergeSmooth}.

<p class="mathjax">We present a method for finding envy-free prices in a combinatorial auction
where the consumers' number $n$ coincides with that of distinct items for sale,
each consumer can buy one single item and each item has only one unit
available. This is a particular case of the {\it unit-demand envy-free pricing
problem}, and was recently revisited by Arbib et al. (2019). These authors
proved that using a Fibonacci heap for solving the maximum weight perfect
matching and the Bellman-Ford algorithm for getting the envy-free prices, the
overall time complexity for solving the problem is $O(n^3)$. We propose a
method based on dynamic programming design strategy that seeks the optimal
envy-free prices by increasing the consumers' utilities, which has the same
cubic complexity time as the aforementioned approach, but whose theoretical and
empirical results indicate that our method performs faster than the shortest
paths strategy, obtaining an average time reduction in determining optimal
envy-free prices of approximately 48\%.

<p class="mathjax">Passive acoustic monitoring can be an effective way of monitoring wildlife
populations that are acoustically active but difficult to survey visually.
Digital recorders allow surveyors to gather large volumes of data at low cost,
but identifying target species vocalisations in these data is non-trivial.
Machine learning (ML) methods are often used to do the identification. They can
process large volumes of data quickly, but they do not detect all vocalisations
and they do generate some false positives (vocalisations that are not from the
target species). Existing wildlife abundance survey methods have been designed
specifically to deal with the first of these mistakes, but current methods of
dealing with false positives are not well-developed. They do not take account
of features of individual vocalisations, some of which are more likely to be
false positives than others. We propose three methods for acoustic spatial
capture-recapture inference that integrate individual-level measures of
confidence from ML vocalisation identification into the likelihood and hence
integrate ML uncertainty into inference. The methods include a mixture model in
which species identity is a latent variable. We test the methods by simulation
and find that in a scenario based on acoustic data from Hainan gibbons, in
which ignoring false positives results in 17% positive bias, our methods give
negligible bias and coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal 95%
level.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal fusion is increasingly being used for autonomous driving tasks,
as images from different modalities provide unique information for feature
extraction. However, the existing two-stream networks are only fused at a
specific network layer, which requires a lot of manual attempts to set up. As
the CNN goes deeper, the two modal features become more and more advanced and
abstract, and the fusion occurs at the feature level with a large gap, which
can easily hurt the performance. In this study, we propose a novel fusion
architecture called skip-cross networks (SkipcrossNets), which combines
adaptively LiDAR point clouds and camera images without being bound to a
certain fusion epoch. Specifically, skip-cross connects each layer to each
layer in a feed-forward manner, and for each layer, the feature maps of all
previous layers are used as input and its own feature maps are used as input to
all subsequent layers for the other modality, enhancing feature propagation and
multi-modal features fusion. This strategy facilitates selection of the most
similar feature layers from two data pipelines, providing a complementary
effect for sparse point cloud features during fusion processes. The network is
also divided into several blocks to reduce the complexity of feature fusion and
the number of model parameters. The advantages of skip-cross fusion were
demonstrated through application to the KITTI and A2D2 datasets, achieving a
MaxF score of 96.85% on KITTI and an F1 score of 84.84% on A2D2. The model
parameters required only 2.33 MB of memory at a speed of 68.24 FPS, which could
be viable for mobile terminals and embedded devices.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, we present a novel data assimilation strategy in pore-scale
imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address
reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).
Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to
investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic
processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the
associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces
discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters
also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that
can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure
reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,
by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.
<br />The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse
problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite
dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the
porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE
models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data
assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating
successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased
uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity
changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian
Inference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT
images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and
dimensionless numbers.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a fast divergence-free spectral algorithm (FDSA)
for the curl-curl problem. Divergence-free bases in two and three dimensions
are constructed by using the generalized Jacobi polynomials. An accurate
spectral method with exact preservation of the divergence-free constraint
point-wisely is then proposed, and its corresponding error estimate is
established. We then present a highly efficient solution algorithm based on a
combination of matrix-free preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative method and
a fully diagonalizable auxiliary problem, which is derived from the spectral
discretisations of generalized eigenvalue problems of Laplace and biharmonic
operators. We rigorously prove that the dimensions of the invariant subspace of
the preconditioned linear system resulting from the divergence-free spectral
method with respect to the dominate eigenvalue $1$, are $(N-3)^2$ and
$2(N-3)^3$ for two- and three-dimensional problems with $(N-1)^2$ and
$2(N-1)^3$ unknowns, respectively. Thus, the proposed method usually takes only
several iterations to converge, and astonishingly, as the problem size
(polynomial order) increases, the number of iterations will decrease, even for
highly indefinite system and oscillatory solutions. As a result, the
computational cost of the solution algorithm is only a small multiple of $N^3$
and $N^4$ floating number operations for 2D and 3D problems, respectively.
Plenty of numerical examples for solving the curl-curl problem with both
constant and variable coefficients in two and three dimensions are presented to
demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">We target cross-domain face reenactment in this paper, i.e., driving a
cartoon image with the video of a real person and vice versa. Recently, many
works have focused on one-shot talking face generation to drive a portrait with
a real video, i.e., within-domain reenactment. Straightforwardly applying those
methods to cross-domain animation will cause inaccurate expression transfer,
blur effects, and even apparent artifacts due to the domain shift between
cartoon and real faces. Only a few works attempt to settle cross-domain face
reenactment. The most related work AnimeCeleb requires constructing a dataset
with pose vector and cartoon image pairs by animating 3D characters, which
makes it inapplicable anymore if no paired data is available. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for cross-domain reenactment without paired data.
Specifically, we propose a transformer-based framework to align the motions
from different domains into a common latent space where motion transfer is
conducted via latent code addition. Two domain-specific motion encoders and two
learnable motion base memories are used to capture domain properties. A source
query transformer and a driving one are exploited to project domain-specific
motion to the canonical space. The edited motion is projected back to the
domain of the source with a transformer. Moreover, since no paired data is
provided, we propose a novel cross-domain training scheme using data from two
domains with the designed analogy constraint. Besides, we contribute a cartoon
dataset in Disney style. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of
our method over competing methods.

<p class="mathjax">In the envy-free perfect matching problem, $n$ items with unit supply are
available to be sold to $n$ buyers with unit demand. The objective is to find
allocation and prices such that both seller's revenue and buyers' surpluses are
maximized -- given the buyers' valuations for the items -- and all items must
be sold. A previous work has shown that this problem can be solved in cubic
time, using maximum weight perfect matchings to find optimal envy-free
allocations and shortest paths to find optimal envy-free prices. In this work,
I consider that buyers have fixed budgets, the items have quality measures and
so the valuations are defined by multiplying these two quantities. Under this
approach, I prove that the valuation matrix have the inverse Monge property,
thus simplifying the search for optimal envy-free allocations and,
consequently, for optimal envy-free prices through a strategy based on dynamic
programming. As result, I propose an algorithm that finds optimal solutions in
quadratic time.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR-based place recognition plays a crucial role in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and LiDAR localization.
<br />Despite the emergence of various deep learning-based and hand-crafting-based
methods, rotation-induced place recognition failure remains a critical
challenge.
<br />Existing studies address this limitation through specific training strategies
or network structures.
<br />However, the former does not produce satisfactory results, while the latter
focuses mainly on the reduced problem of SO(2) rotation invariance. Methods
targeting SO(3) rotation invariance suffer from limitations in discrimination
capability.
<br />In this paper, we propose a new method that employs Vector Neurons Network
(VNN) to achieve SO(3) rotation invariance.
<br />We first extract rotation-equivariant features from neighboring points and
map low-dimensional features to a high-dimensional space through VNN.
<br />Afterwards, we calculate the Euclidean and Cosine distance in the
rotation-equivariant feature space as rotation-invariant feature descriptors.
<br />Finally, we aggregate the features using GeM pooling to obtain global
descriptors.
<br />To address the significant information loss when formulating
rotation-invariant descriptors, we propose computing distances between features
at different layers within the Euclidean space neighborhood.
<br />This greatly improves the discriminability of the point cloud descriptors
while ensuring computational efficiency.
<br />Experimental results on public datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms other baseline methods implementing rotation invariance, while
achieving comparable results with current state-of-the-art place recognition
methods that do not consider rotation issues.

<p class="mathjax">Efficiently optimizing multi-model inference pipelines for fast, accurate,
and cost-effective inference is a crucial challenge in ML production systems,
given their tight end-to-end latency requirements. To simplify the exploration
of the vast and intricate trade-off space of accuracy and cost in inference
pipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, the
challenge lies in reconciling accuracy and cost trade-offs. To address this
challenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants in
inference pipelines, we present IPA, an online deep-learning Inference Pipeline
Adaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deep
learning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained models for
the same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency,
and accuracy. IPA dynamically configures batch size, replication, and model
variants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latency
SLAs using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for
achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while
remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns.
Extensive experiments on a Kubernetes implementation with five real-world
inference pipelines demonstrate that IPA improves normalized accuracy by up to
35% with a minimal cost increase of less than 5%.

<p class="mathjax">To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used for
temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention
mechanism called easy attention. Due to the fact that self attention only makes
usage of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the
keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score
required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through
implementing singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score,
we further observe that the self attention compresses contribution from both
queries and keys in the spanned space of the attention score. Therefore, our
proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as
learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when
reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems
exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than the self attention or the
widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our results show great
potential for applications in more complex high-dimensional dynamical systems.

<p class="mathjax">In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau transitioned from data swapping to
differential privacy (DP) in its approach to de-identifying decennial census
data. This decision has faced considerable criticism from data users,
particularly due to concerns about the accuracy of DP. We compare the relative
impacts of swapping and DP on census data, focusing on the use case of school
planning, where single-year-of-age population counts (i.e., the number of
four-year-olds in the district) are used to estimate the number of incoming
students and make resulting decisions surrounding faculty, classrooms, and
funding requests. We examine these impacts for school districts of varying
population sizes and age distributions.
<br />Our findings support the use of DP over swapping for single-year-of-age
counts; in particular, concerning behaviors associated with DP (namely, poor
behavior for smaller districts) occur with swapping mechanisms as well. For the
school planning use cases we investigate, DP provides comparable, if not
improved, accuracy over swapping, while offering other benefits such as
improved transparency.

<p class="mathjax">For the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for pattern classification,
the training loss function is usually applied to the final output of the
network, except for some regularization constraints on the network parameters.
However, with the increasing of the number of network layers, the influence of
the loss function on the network front layers gradually decreases, and the
network parameters tend to fall into local optimization. At the same time, it
is found that the trained network has significant information redundancy at all
stages of features, which reduces the effectiveness of feature mapping at all
stages and is not conducive to the change of the subsequent parameters of the
network in the direction of optimality. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a
more optimized solution of the network and further improve the classification
accuracy of the network by designing a loss function for restraining the front
stage features and eliminating the information redundancy of the front stage
features .For CNN, this article proposes a multi-stage feature decorrelation
loss (MFD Loss), which refines effective features and eliminates information
redundancy by constraining the correlation of features at all stages.
Considering that there are many layers in CNN, through experimental comparison
and analysis, MFD Loss acts on multiple front layers of CNN, constrains the
output features of each layer and each channel, and performs supervision
training jointly with classification loss function during network training.
Compared with the single Softmax Loss supervised learning, the experiments on
several commonly used datasets on several typical CNNs prove that the
classification performance of Softmax Loss+MFD Loss is significantly better.
Meanwhile, the comparison experiments before and after the combination of MFD
Loss and some other typical loss functions verify its good universality.

<p class="mathjax">Audio classification aims at recognizing audio signals, including speech
commands or sound events. However, current audio classifiers are susceptible to
perturbations and adversarial attacks. In addition, real-world audio
classification tasks often suffer from limited labeled data. To help bridge
these gaps, previous work developed neuro-inspired convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) with sparse coding via the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA)
in the first layer (i.e., LCANets) for computer vision. LCANets learn in a
combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, reducing dependency on
labeled samples. Motivated by the fact that auditory cortex is also sparse, we
extend LCANets to audio recognition tasks and introduce LCANets++, which are
CNNs that perform sparse coding in multiple layers via LCA. We demonstrate that
LCANets++ are more robust than standard CNNs and LCANets against perturbations,
e.g., background noise, as well as black-box and white-box attacks, e.g.,
evasion and fast gradient sign (FGSM) attacks.

families to NPN to reflect the Nuzi studies after 1943. Nuzi is a town from the
15th - 14th century B.C.E.for a period of some five generations in Arrapha. The
cuneiform tablets listed in NPN are for contracts on land transactions,
marriage, loans, slavery, etc. In NPN, the kinships and cuneiform tablets
(contracts, documents, texts) involved are listed for each person. We
reconstruct family trees from the added NPN to formulate the least squares
problem with the constraints: a person's father is at least 22.5 years older
than the person, contractors were living at the time of the contract, etc. Our
results agree with the Assyriological results of M. P. Maidman on the seniority
among siblings of a powerful family. Our method could be applied to the other
clay tablet archives once we have the name index in the format of NPN.

<p class="mathjax">We present a second-order strictly length-preserving and unconditionally
energy-stable rotational discrete gradient (Rdg) scheme for the numerical
approximation of the Oseen-Frank gradient flows with anisotropic elastic energy
functional. Two essential ingredients of the Rdg method are reformulation of
the length constrained gradient flow into an unconstrained rotational form and
discrete gradient discretization for the energy variation. Besides the
well-known mean-value and Gonzalez discrete gradients, we propose a novel
Oseen-Frank discrete gradient, specifically designed for the solution of
Oseen-Frank gradient flow. We prove that the proposed Oseen-Frank discrete
gradient satisfies the energy difference relation, thus the resultant Rdg
scheme is energy stable. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and
accuracy of the proposed Rdg method and its capability for providing reliable
simulation results with highly disparate elastic coefficients.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid entry of machine learning approaches in our daily activities and
high-stakes domains demands transparency and scrutiny of their fairness and
reliability. To help gauge machine learning models' robustness, research
typically focuses on the massive datasets used for their deployment, e.g.,
creating and maintaining documentation for understanding their origin, process
of development, and ethical considerations. However, data collection for AI is
still typically a one-off practice, and oftentimes datasets collected for a
certain purpose or application are reused for a different problem.
Additionally, dataset annotations may not be representative over time, contain
ambiguous or erroneous annotations, or be unable to generalize across issues or
domains. Recent research has shown these practices might lead to unfair,
biased, or inaccurate outcomes. We argue that data collection for AI should be
performed in a responsible manner where the quality of the data is thoroughly
scrutinized and measured through a systematic set of appropriate metrics. In
this paper, we propose a Responsible AI (RAI) methodology designed to guide the
data collection with a set of metrics for an iterative in-depth analysis of the
factors influencing the quality and reliability} of the generated data. We
propose a granular set of measurements to inform on the internal reliability of
a dataset and its external stability over time. We validate our approach across
nine existing datasets and annotation tasks and four content modalities. This
approach impacts the assessment of data robustness used for AI applied in the
real world, where diversity of users and content is eminent. Furthermore, it
deals with fairness and accountability aspects in data collection by providing
systematic and transparent quality analysis for data collections.

<p class="mathjax">This article investigates the weak approximation towards the invariant
measure of semi-linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) under
non-globally Lipschitz coefficients. For this purpose, we propose a
linear-theta-projected Euler (LTPE) scheme, which also admits an invariant

certain assumptions, both the SDE and the corresponding LTPE method are shown
to converge exponentially to the underlying invariant measures, respectively.
Moreover, with time-independent regularity estimates for the corresponding
Kolmogorov equation, the weak error between the numerical invariant measure and
the original one can be guaranteed with an order one. Numerical experiments are
provided to verify our theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">The mainstream of data-driven abstractive summarization models tends to
explore the correlations rather than the causal relationships. Among such
correlations, there can be spurious ones which suffer from the language prior
learned from the training corpus and therefore undermine the overall
effectiveness of the learned model. To tackle this issue, we introduce a
Structural Causal Model (SCM) to induce the underlying causal structure of the
summarization data. We assume several latent causal factors and non-causal
factors, representing the content and style of the document and summary.
Theoretically, we prove that the latent factors in our SCM can be identified by
fitting the observed training data under certain conditions. On the basis of
this, we propose a Causality Inspired Sequence-to-Sequence model (CI-Seq2Seq)
to learn the causal representations that can mimic the causal factors, guiding
us to pursue causal information for summary generation. The key idea is to
reformulate the Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) to fit the joint distribution of
the document and summary variables from the training corpus. Experimental
results on two widely used text summarization datasets demonstrate the
advantages of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the need
for accurate and efficient prompting approaches. LLMs are often applied in
Few-Shot Learning (FSL) contexts, where tasks are executed with minimal
training data. FSL has become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI)
subdomains, including AI for health. Rare diseases, affecting a small fraction
of the population, inherently require FSL techniques due to limited data
availability, though manual data collection and annotation is costly and
time-consuming. In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), a
flexible prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSL
settings. MVP works by prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks and
then conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs. This method achieves
improved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease
identification and classification tasks. We also release a novel rare disease
dataset for FSL, available to those who agreed to the MIMIC-IV Data Use
Agreement (DUA). Furthermore, in using MVP, each model is prompted multiple
times, substantially increasing the time needed for manual annotation, and to
address this, we assess the feasibility of using JSON for automating generative
LLM evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that associates a label with
each pixel in an image. Modern approaches tend to introduce class embeddings
into semantic segmentation for deeply utilizing category semantics, and regard
supervised class masks as final predictions. In this paper, we explore the
mechanism of class embeddings and have an insight that more explicit and
meaningful class embeddings can be generated based on class masks purposely.
Following this observation, we propose ECENet, a new segmentation paradigm, in
which class embeddings are obtained and enhanced explicitly during interacting
with multi-stage image features. Based on this, we revisit the traditional
decoding process and explore inverted information flow between segmentation
masks and class embeddings. Furthermore, to ensure the discriminability and
informativity of features from backbone, we propose a Feature Reconstruction
module, which combines intrinsic and diverse branches together to ensure the
concurrence of diversity and redundancy in features. Experiments show that our
ECENet outperforms its counterparts on the ADE20K dataset with much less
computational cost and achieves new state-of-the-art results on PASCAL-Context
dataset. The code will be released at https://gitee.com/mindspore/models and

<p class="mathjax">This paper highlights the need to bring document classification benchmarking
closer to real-world applications, both in the nature of data tested ($X$:
multi-channel, multi-paged, multi-industry; $Y$: class distributions and label
set variety) and in classification tasks considered ($f$: multi-page document,
page stream, and document bundle classification, ...). We identify the lack of
public multi-page document classification datasets, formalize different
classification tasks arising in application scenarios, and motivate the value
of targeting efficient multi-page document representations. An experimental
study on proposed multi-page document classification datasets demonstrates that
current benchmarks have become irrelevant and need to be updated to evaluate
complete documents, as they naturally occur in practice. This reality check
also calls for more mature evaluation methodologies, covering calibration
evaluation, inference complexity (time-memory), and a range of realistic
distribution shifts (e.g., born-digital vs. scanning noise, shifting page
order). Our study ends on a hopeful note by recommending concrete avenues for
future improvements.}

<p class="mathjax">The multimedia community has shown a significant interest in perceiving and
representing the physical world with multimodal pretrained neural network
models, and among them, the visual-language pertaining (VLP) is, currently, the
most captivating topic. However, there have been few endeavors dedicated to the
exploration of 1) whether essential linguistic knowledge (e.g., semantics and
syntax) can be extracted during VLP, and 2) how such linguistic knowledge
impact or enhance the multimodal alignment. In response, here we aim to
elucidate the impact of comprehensive linguistic knowledge, including semantic
expression and syntactic structure, on multimodal alignment. Specifically, we
design and release the SNARE, the first large-scale multimodal alignment
probing benchmark, to detect the vital linguistic components, e.g., lexical,
semantic, and syntax knowledge, containing four tasks: Semantic structure,
Negation logic, Attribute ownership, and Relationship composition. Based on our
proposed probing benchmarks, our holistic analyses of five advanced VLP models
illustrate that the VLP model: i) shows insensitivity towards complex syntax
structures and relies on content words for sentence comprehension; ii)
demonstrates limited comprehension of combinations between sentences and
negations; iii) faces challenges in determining the presence of actions or
spatial relationships within visual information and struggles with verifying
the correctness of triple combinations. We make our benchmark and code
available at \url{https://github.com/WangFei-2019/SNARE/}.

development of deep learning techniques and the availability of large-scale
datasets. However, challenges persist in accessing and utilizing diverse urban
spatial-temporal datasets from different sources and stored in different
formats, as well as determining effective model structures and components with
the proliferation of deep learning models. This work addresses these challenges
and provides three significant contributions. Firstly, we introduce "atomic
files", a unified storage format designed for urban spatial-temporal big data,
and validate its effectiveness on 40 diverse datasets, simplifying data
management. Secondly, we present a comprehensive overview of technological
advances in urban spatial-temporal prediction models, guiding the development
of robust models. Thirdly, we conduct extensive experiments using diverse
models and datasets, establishing a performance leaderboard and identifying
promising research directions. Overall, this work effectively manages urban
spatial-temporal data, guides future efforts, and facilitates the development
of accurate and efficient urban spatial-temporal prediction models. It can
potentially make long-term contributions to urban spatial-temporal data
management and prediction, ultimately leading to improved urban living

<p class="mathjax">Low-light images, characterized by inadequate illumination, pose challenges
of diminished clarity, muted colors, and reduced details. Low-light image
enhancement, an essential task in computer vision, aims to rectify these issues
by improving brightness, contrast, and overall perceptual quality, thereby
facilitating accurate analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces the
Convolutional Dense Attention-guided Network (CDAN), a novel solution for
enhancing low-light images. CDAN integrates an autoencoder-based architecture
with convolutional and dense blocks, complemented by an attention mechanism and
skip connections. This architecture ensures efficient information propagation
and feature learning. Furthermore, a dedicated post-processing phase refines
color balance and contrast. Our approach demonstrates notable progress compared
to state-of-the-art results in low-light image enhancement, showcasing its
robustness across a wide range of challenging scenarios. Our model performs
remarkably on benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating under-exposure and
proficiently restoring textures and colors in diverse low-light scenarios. This
achievement underscores CDAN's potential for diverse computer vision tasks,
notably enabling robust object detection and recognition in challenging
low-light conditions.

domain decomposition applied to unconstrained parabolic optimal control
problems. After a spatial semi-discretization, we use the Lagrange multiplier
approach to derive a coupled forward-backward optimality system, which can then
be solved using a time domain decomposition. Due to the forward-backward
structure of the optimality system, three variants can be found for the
Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Dirichlet algorithms. We analyze their
convergence behavior and determine the optimal relaxation parameter for each
algorithm. Our analysis reveals that the most natural algorithms are actually
only good smoothers, and there are better choices which lead to efficient
solvers. We illustrate our analysis with numerical experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Recent innovation in large language models (LLMs), and their myriad use-cases
have rapidly driven up the compute capacity demand for datacenter GPUs. Several
cloud providers and other enterprises have made substantial plans of growth in
their datacenters to support these new workloads. One of the key bottleneck
resources in datacenters is power, and given the increasing model sizes of
LLMs, they are becoming increasingly power intensive. In this paper, we show
that there is a significant opportunity to oversubscribe power in LLM clusters.
Power oversubscription improves the power efficiency of these datacenters,
allowing more deployable servers per datacenter, and reduces the deployment
time, since building new datacenters is slow.
<br />We extensively characterize the power consumption patterns of a variety of
LLMs and their configurations. We identify the differences between the
inference and training power consumption patterns. Based on our analysis of
these LLMs, we claim that the average and peak power utilization in LLM
clusters for inference should not be very high. Our deductions align with the
data from production LLM clusters, revealing that inference workloads offer
substantial headroom for power oversubscription. However, the stringent set of
telemetry and controls that GPUs offer in a virtualized environment, makes it
challenging to have a reliable and robust power oversubscription mechanism.
<br />We propose POLCA, our framework for power oversubscription that is robust,
reliable, and readily deployable for GPU clusters. Using open-source models to
replicate the power patterns observed in production, we simulate POLCA and
demonstrate that we can deploy 30% more servers in the same GPU cluster for
inference, with minimal performance loss

<p class="mathjax">Urban-scale quantification of window views can inform housing selection and
valuation, landscape management, and urban planning. However, window views are
numerous in high-rise, high-density urban areas and current automatic
assessments of window views are inaccurate and time-consuming. Thus, both
accurate and efficient assessment of window views is significant in improving
the automation for urban-scale window view applications. The paper presents an
automatic, accurate, and efficient assessment of window view indices (WVIs) of
greenery, sky, waterbody, and construction using 3D color City Information
Models (CIMs). The workflow includes: i) 3D semantic segmentation of
photorealistic CIM and Digital Surface Model (DSM), and ii) batch computation
of WVIs. Experimental results showed the estimated WVIs were more accurate
(RMSE &lt; 0.01), and the proposed method was more efficient (3.68 times faster)
than Li et al.'s (2022) 2D semantic segmentation. Thus, the proposed method can
facilitate large-scale WVI assessment and update in healthy high-rise,
high-density urban development.

<p class="mathjax">We propose Subject-Conditional Relation Detection SCoRD, where conditioned on
an input subject, the goal is to predict all its relations to other objects in
a scene along with their locations. Based on the Open Images dataset, we
propose a challenging OIv6-SCoRD benchmark such that the training and testing
splits have a distribution shift in terms of the occurrence statistics of
$\langle$subject, relation, object$\rangle$ triplets. To solve this problem, we
propose an auto-regressive model that given a subject, it predicts its
relations, objects, and object locations by casting this output as a sequence
of tokens. First, we show that previous scene-graph prediction methods fail to
produce as exhaustive an enumeration of relation-object pairs when conditioned
on a subject on this benchmark. Particularly, we obtain a recall@3 of 83.8% for
our relation-object predictions compared to the 49.75% obtained by a recent
scene graph detector. Then, we show improved generalization on both
relation-object and object-box predictions by leveraging during training
relation-object pairs obtained automatically from textual captions and for
which no object-box annotations are available. Particularly, for
$\langle$subject, relation, object$\rangle$ triplets for which no object
locations are available during training, we are able to obtain a recall@3 of
42.59% for relation-object pairs and 32.27% for their box locations.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal-aware recommender systems (MRSs) exploit multimodal content (e.g.,
product images or descriptions) as items' side information to improve
recommendation accuracy. While most of such methods rely on factorization
models (e.g., MFBPR) as base architecture, it has been shown that MFBPR may be
affected by popularity bias, meaning that it inherently tends to boost the
recommendation of popular (i.e., short-head) items at the detriment of niche
(i.e., long-tail) items from the catalog. Motivated by this assumption, in this
work, we provide one of the first analyses on how multimodality in
recommendation could further amplify popularity bias. Concretely, we evaluate
the performance of four state-of-the-art MRSs algorithms (i.e., VBPR, MMGCN,
GRCN, LATTICE) on three datasets from Amazon by assessing, along with
recommendation accuracy metrics, performance measures accounting for the
diversity of recommended items and the portion of retrieved niche items. To
better investigate this aspect, we decide to study the separate influence of
each modality (i.e., visual and textual) on popularity bias in different
evaluation dimensions. Results, which demonstrate how the single modality may
augment the negative effect of popularity bias, shed light on the importance to
provide a more rigorous analysis of the performance of such models.

players lead in-game reality through co-created storytelling with the character
driven by large language model. The concept is inspired by Wittgenstein's idea
of the limits of one's world being determined by the bounds of their language.
Using advanced AI tools like GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion, the second iteration
of the game enables the protagonist, Shahrzad, to realize words and stories in
her world. The player can steer the conversation with the AI King towards
specific keywords, which then become battle equipment in the game. This blend
of interactive narrative and text-to-image transformation challenges the
conventional border between the game world and reality through a dual
perspective. We focus on Shahrzad, who seeks to alter her fate compared to the
original folklore, and the player, who collaborates with AI to craft narratives
and shape the game world. We explore the technical and design elements of
implementing such a game with an objective to enhance the narrative game genre
with AI-generated content and to delve into AI-native gameplay possibilities.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, has spurred a
significant research effort towards their application for downstream supervised
learning tasks. Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised
fine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class
names associated with ground truth labels. In this paper, we delve into a
realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario by assuming that the unlabeled data
might contain out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes. Furthermore, we
emphasize the importance of simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution
detection capabilities alongside the recognition of instances associated with
predefined class labels.
<br />To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective
fine-tuning approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages
sample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy of
confident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confident
instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompts, UEO also incorporates
optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of
CLIP. Through extensive experiments conducted across 15 domains and 4 different
types of prior knowledge, we demonstrate that UEO surpasses baseline methods in
terms of both generalization and out-of-distribution detection.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing trend in adopting electric vehicles (EVs) will significantly
impact the residential electricity demand, which results in an increased risk
of transformer overload in the distribution grid. To mitigate such risks, there
are urgent needs to develop effective EV charging controllers. Currently, the
majority of the EV charge controllers are based on a centralized approach for
managing individual EVs or a group of EVs. In this paper, we introduce a
decentralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) charging framework that
prioritizes the preservation of privacy for EV owners. We employ the
Centralized Training Decentralized Execution-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(CTDE-DDPG) scheme, which provides valuable information to users during
training while maintaining privacy during execution. Our results demonstrate
that the CTDE framework improves the performance of the charging network by
reducing the network costs. Moreover, we show that the Peak-to-Average Ratio
(PAR) of the total demand is reduced, which, in turn, reduces the risk of
transformer overload during the peak hours.

<p class="mathjax">Decision-making problems can be represented as mathematical optimization
models, finding wide applications in fields such as economics, engineering and
manufacturing, transportation, and health care. Optimization models are
mathematical abstractions of the problem of making the best decision while
satisfying a set of requirements or constraints. One of the primary barriers to
deploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners
understand and interpret such models, particularly when they are infeasible,
meaning no decision satisfies all the constraints. Existing methods for
diagnosing infeasible optimization models often rely on expert systems,
necessitating significant background knowledge in optimization. In this paper,
we introduce OptiChat, a first-of-its-kind natural language-based system
equipped with a chatbot GUI for engaging in interactive conversations about
infeasible optimization models. OptiChat can provide natural language
descriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of
infeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The
implementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an
optimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render
the entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible
Infeasible Subset (IIS). We utilize few-shot learning, expert chain-of-thought,
key-retrieve, and sentiment prompts to enhance OptiChat's reliability. Our
experiments demonstrate that OptiChat assists both expert and non-expert users
in improving their understanding of the optimization models, enabling them to
quickly identify the sources of infeasibility.

<p class="mathjax">Low-count time series describe sparse or intermittent events, which are
prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data
types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time
series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are
provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are
not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection
community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably
detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel
generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count
time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical
analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the
distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to
mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how
anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical
utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset
containing sales data for retail stores.

<p class="mathjax">Within the framework of computational plasticity, recent advances show that
the quasi-static response of an elasto-plastic structure under cyclic loadings
may exhibit a time multiscale behaviour. In particular, the system response can
be computed in terms of time microscale and macroscale modes using a weakly
intrusive multi-time Proper Generalized Decomposition (MT-PGD). In this work,
such micro-macro characterization of the time response is exploited to build a
data-driven model of the elasto-plastic constitutive relation. This can be
viewed as a predictor-corrector scheme where the prediction is driven by the
macrotime evolution and the correction is performed via a sparse sampling in
space. Once the nonlinear term is forecasted, the multi-time PGD algorithm
allows the fast computation of the total strain. The algorithm shows
considerable gains in terms of computational time, opening new perspectives in
the numerical simulation of history-dependent problems defined in very large
time intervals.

<p class="mathjax">Image segmentation and depth estimation are crucial tasks in computer vision,
especially in autonomous driving scenarios. Although these tasks are typically
addressed separately, we propose an innovative approach to combine them in our
novel deep learning network, Panoptic-DepthLab. By incorporating an additional
depth estimation branch into the segmentation network, it can predict the depth
of each instance segment. Evaluating on Cityscape dataset, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in achieving high-quality segmentation results with
depth and visualize it with a color map. Our proposed method demonstrates a new
possibility of combining different tasks and networks to generate a more
comprehensive image recognition result to facilitate the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles.

<p class="mathjax">Monocular 3D object detection is a crucial and challenging task for
autonomous driving vehicle, while it uses only a single camera image to infer
3D objects in the scene. To address the difficulty of predicting depth using
only pictorial clue, we propose a novel perspective-aware convolutional layer
that captures long-range dependencies in images. By enforcing convolutional
kernels to extract features along the depth axis of every image pixel, we
incorporates perspective information into network architecture. We integrate
our perspective-aware convolutional layer into a 3D object detector and
demonstrate improved performance on the KITTI3D dataset, achieving a 23.9\%
average precision in the easy benchmark. These results underscore the
importance of modeling scene clues for accurate depth inference and highlight
the benefits of incorporating scene structure in network design. Our
perspective-aware convolutional layer has the potential to enhance object
detection accuracy by providing more precise and context-aware feature
extraction.

<p class="mathjax">Recently deep learning surrogates and neural operators have shown promise in
solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they often require a
large amount of training data and are limited to bounded domains. In this work,
we present a novel physics-informed neural operator method to solve
parametrized boundary value problems without labeled data. By reformulating the
PDEs into boundary integral equations (BIEs), we can train the operator network
solely on the boundary of the domain. This approach reduces the number of
required sample points from $O(N^d)$ to $O(N^{d-1})$, where $d$ is the domain's
dimension, leading to a significant acceleration of the training process.
Additionally, our method can handle unbounded problems, which are unattainable
for existing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators. Our
numerical experiments show the effectiveness of parametrized complex geometries
and unbounded problems.

setting of person-level DP (a.k.a. user-level DP) where each person may
contribute an unbounded number of items and hence the sensitivity is unbounded.
<br />Our approach is to compute a bounded-sensitivity version of this query, which
reduces to solving a max-flow problem. The sensitivity bound is optimized to
balance the noise we must add to privatize the answer against the error of the
approximation of the bounded-sensitivity query to the true number of unique

<p class="mathjax">The cost of labeling data often limits the performance of machine learning
systems. In multi-task learning, related tasks provide information to each
other and improve overall performance, but the label cost can vary among tasks.
How should the label budget (i.e. the amount of money spent on labeling) be
allocated among different tasks to achieve optimal multi-task performance? We
are the first to propose and formally define the label budget allocation
problem in multi-task learning and to empirically show that different budget
allocation strategies make a big difference to its performance. We propose a
Task-Adaptive Budget Allocation algorithm to robustly generate the optimal
budget allocation adaptive to different multi-task learning settings.
Specifically, we estimate and then maximize the extent of new information
obtained from the allocated budget as a proxy for multi-task learning
performance. Experiments on PASCAL VOC and Taskonomy demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach over other widely used heuristic labeling strategies.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce BridgeData V2, a large and diverse dataset of robotic
manipulation behaviors designed to facilitate research on scalable robot
learning. BridgeData V2 contains 60,096 trajectories collected across 24
environments on a publicly available low-cost robot. BridgeData V2 provides
extensive task and environment variability, leading to skills that can
generalize across environments, domains, and institutions, making the dataset a
useful resource for a broad range of researchers. Additionally, the dataset is
compatible with a wide variety of open-vocabulary, multi-task learning methods
conditioned on goal images or natural language instructions. In our
experiments, we train 6 state-of-the-art imitation learning and offline
reinforcement learning methods on our dataset, and find that they succeed on a
suite of tasks requiring varying amounts of generalization. We also demonstrate
that the performance of these methods improves with more data and higher

<p class="mathjax">Under the current regulatory framework for data protections, the protection
of human rights writ large and the corresponding outcomes are regulated largely
independently from the data and tools that both threaten those rights and are
needed to protect them. This separation between tools and the outcomes they
generate risks overregulation of the data and tools themselves when not linked
to sensitive use cases. In parallel, separation risks under-regulation if the
data can be collected and processed under a less-restrictive framework, but
used to drive an outcome that requires additional sensitivity and restrictions.
A new approach is needed to support differential protections based on the
genuinely high-risk use cases within each sector. Here, we propose a regulatory
framework designed to apply not to specific data or tools themselves, but to
the outcomes and rights that are linked to the use of these data and tools in
context. This framework is designed to recognize, address, and protect a broad
range of human rights, including privacy, and suggests a more flexible approach
to policy making that is aligned with current engineering tools and practices.
We test this framework in the context of open banking and describe how current
privacy-enhancing technologies and other engineering strategies can be applied
in this context and that of contract tracing applications. This approach for
data protection regulations more effectively builds on existing engineering
tools and protects the wide range of human rights defined by legislation and
constitutions around the globe.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) shows remarkable progress with the
assistance of extremely heavy parameters, which challenges deployment in real
applications. Knowledge distillation is well recognized as the essential
procedure in model compression. However, existing knowledge distillation
techniques lack an in-depth investigation and analysis of VLP, and practical
guidelines for VLP-oriented distillation are still not yet explored. In this
paper, we present DLIP, a simple yet efficient Distilling Language-Image
Pre-training framework, through which we investigate how to distill a light VLP
model. Specifically, we dissect the model distillation from multiple
dimensions, such as the architecture characteristics of different modules and
the information transfer of different modalities. We conduct comprehensive
experiments and provide insights on distilling a light but performant VLP
model. Experimental results reveal that DLIP can achieve a state-of-the-art
accuracy/efficiency trade-off across diverse cross-modal tasks, e.g.,
image-text retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. For
example, DLIP compresses BLIP by 1.9x, from 213M to 108M parameters, while
achieving comparable or better performance. Furthermore, DLIP succeeds in
retaining more than 95% of the performance with 22.4% parameters and 24.8%
FLOPs compared to the teacher model and accelerates inference speed by 2.7x.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) have proven effective
for zero-shot classification. Despite the success, most traditional VLMs-based
methods are restricted by the assumption of partial source supervision or ideal
vocabularies, which rarely satisfy the open-world scenario. In this paper, we
aim at a more challenging setting, Realistic Zero-Shot Classification, which
assumes no annotation but instead a broad vocabulary. To address this
challenge, we propose the Self Structural Semantic Alignment (S^3A) framework,
which extracts the structural semantic information from unlabeled data while
simultaneously self-learning. Our S^3A framework adopts a unique
Cluster-Vote-Prompt-Realign (CVPR) algorithm, which iteratively groups
unlabeled data to derive structural semantics for pseudo-supervision. Our CVPR
process includes iterative clustering on images, voting within each cluster to
identify initial class candidates from the vocabulary, generating
discriminative prompts with large language models to discern confusing
candidates, and realigning images and the vocabulary as structural semantic
alignment. Finally, we propose to self-learn the CLIP image encoder with both
individual and structural semantic alignment through a teacher-student learning
strategy. Our comprehensive experiments across various generic and fine-grained
benchmarks demonstrate that the S^3A method offers substantial improvements
over existing VLMs-based approaches, achieving a more than 15% accuracy
improvement over CLIP on average. Our codes, models, and prompts are publicly
released at https://github.com/sheng-eatamath/S3A.

<p class="mathjax">To reduce the reliance on large-scale datasets, recent works in 3D
segmentation resort to few-shot learning. Current 3D few-shot semantic
segmentation methods first pre-train the models on `seen' classes, and then
evaluate their generalization performance on `unseen' classes. However, the
prior pre-training stage not only introduces excessive time overhead, but also
incurs a significant domain gap on `unseen' classes. To tackle these issues, we
propose an efficient Training-free Few-shot 3D Segmentation netwrok, TFS3D, and
a further training-based variant, TFS3D-T. Without any learnable parameters,
TFS3D extracts dense representations by trigonometric positional encodings, and
achieves comparable performance to previous training-based methods. Due to the
elimination of pre-training, TFS3D can alleviate the domain gap issue and save
a substantial amount of time. Building upon TFS3D, TFS3D-T only requires to
train a lightweight query-support transferring attention (QUEST), which
enhances the interaction between the few-shot query and support data.
Experiments demonstrate TFS3D-T improves previous state-of-the-art methods by
+6.93% and +17.96% mIoU respectively on S3DIS and ScanNet, while reducing the
training time by -90%, indicating superior effectiveness and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Several recent works have directly extended the image masked autoencoder
(MAE) with random masking into video domain, achieving promising results.
However, unlike images, both spatial and temporal information are important for
video understanding. This suggests that the random masking strategy that is
inherited from the image MAE is less effective for video MAE. This motivates
the design of a novel masking algorithm that can more efficiently make use of
video saliency. Specifically, we propose a motion-guided masking algorithm
(MGM) which leverages motion vectors to guide the position of each mask over
time. Crucially, these motion-based correspondences can be directly obtained
from information stored in the compressed format of the video, which makes our
method efficient and scalable. On two challenging large-scale video benchmarks
(Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2), we equip video MAE with our MGM and
achieve up to +$1.3\%$ improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. Additionally, our MGM achieves equivalent performance to previous
video MAE using up to $66\%$ fewer training epochs. Lastly, we show that MGM
generalizes better to downstream transfer learning and domain adaptation tasks
on the UCF101, HMDB51, and Diving48 datasets, achieving up to +$4.9\%$
improvement compared to baseline methods.

<p class="mathjax">Despite tremendous advancements in bird's-eye view (BEV) perception, existing
models fall short in generating realistic and coherent semantic map layouts,
and they fail to account for uncertainties arising from partial sensor
information (such as occlusion or limited coverage). In this work, we introduce
MapPrior, a novel BEV perception framework that combines a traditional
discriminative BEV perception model with a learned generative model for
semantic map layouts. Our MapPrior delivers predictions with better accuracy,
realism, and uncertainty awareness. We evaluate our model on the large-scale
nuScenes benchmark. At the time of submission, MapPrior outperforms the
strongest competing method, with significantly improved MMD and ECE scores in
camera- and LiDAR-based BEV perception.

<p class="mathjax">Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle to synthesize realistic
images given dense captions, where each text prompt provides a detailed
description for a specific image region. To address this, we propose
DenseDiffusion, a training-free method that adapts a pre-trained text-to-image
model to handle such dense captions while offering control over the scene
layout. We first analyze the relationship between generated images' layouts and
the pre-trained model's intermediate attention maps. Next, we develop an
attention modulation method that guides objects to appear in specific regions
according to layout guidance. Without requiring additional fine-tuning or
datasets, we improve image generation performance given dense captions
regarding both automatic and human evaluation scores. In addition, we achieve
similar-quality visual results with models specifically trained with layout
conditions.

<p class="mathjax">The regression of 3D Human Pose and Shape (HPS) from an image is becoming
increasingly accurate. This makes the results useful for downstream tasks like
human action recognition or 3D graphics. Yet, no regressor is perfect, and
accuracy can be affected by ambiguous image evidence or by poses and appearance
that are unseen during training. Most current HPS regressors, however, do not
report the confidence of their outputs, meaning that downstream tasks cannot
differentiate accurate estimates from inaccurate ones. To address this, we
develop POCO, a novel framework for training HPS regressors to estimate not
only a 3D human body, but also their confidence, in a single feed-forward pass.
Specifically, POCO estimates both the 3D body pose and a per-sample variance.
The key idea is to introduce a Dual Conditioning Strategy (DCS) for regressing
uncertainty that is highly correlated to pose reconstruction quality. The POCO
framework can be applied to any HPS regressor and here we evaluate it by
modifying HMR, PARE, and CLIFF. In all cases, training the network to reason
about uncertainty helps it learn to more accurately estimate 3D pose. While
this was not our goal, the improvement is modest but consistent. Our main
motivation is to provide uncertainty estimates for downstream tasks; we
demonstrate this in two ways: (1) We use the confidence estimates to bootstrap
HPS training. Given unlabelled image data, we take the confident estimates of a
POCO-trained regressor as pseudo ground truth. Retraining with this
automatically-curated data improves accuracy. (2) We exploit uncertainty in
video pose estimation by automatically identifying uncertain frames (e.g. due
to occlusion) and inpainting these from confident frames. Code and models will
be available for research at https://poco.is.tue.mpg.de.

<p class="mathjax">Recent implicit neural representations have shown great results for novel
view synthesis. However, existing methods require expensive per-scene
optimization from many views hence limiting their application to real-world
unbounded urban settings where the objects of interest or backgrounds are
observed from very few views. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a new
approach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoor
scenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\deg} scenes
from a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in
capturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a
hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any
world point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and
bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than
each. NeO 360's representation allows us to learn from a large collection of
unbounded 3D scenes while offering generalizability to new views and novel
scenes from as few as a single image during inference. We demonstrate our
approach on the proposed challenging 360{\deg} unbounded dataset, called NeRDS
360, and show that NeO 360 outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable methods
for novel view synthesis while also offering editing and composition
capabilities. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">Automatic high-quality rendering of anime scenes from complex real-world
images is of significant practical value. The challenges of this task lie in
the complexity of the scenes, the unique features of anime style, and the lack
of high-quality datasets to bridge the domain gap. Despite promising attempts,
previous efforts are still incompetent in achieving satisfactory results with
consistent semantic preservation, evident stylization, and fine details. In
this study, we propose Scenimefy, a novel semi-supervised image-to-image
translation framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach guides the
learning with structure-consistent pseudo paired data, simplifying the pure
unsupervised setting. The pseudo data are derived uniquely from a
semantic-constrained StyleGAN leveraging rich model priors like CLIP. We
further apply segmentation-guided data selection to obtain high-quality pseudo
supervision. A patch-wise contrastive style loss is introduced to improve
stylization and fine details. Besides, we contribute a high-resolution anime
scene dataset to facilitate future research. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of both perceptual quality and quantitative performance.

<p class="mathjax">Existing automatic approaches for 3D virtual character motion synthesis
supporting scene interactions do not generalise well to new objects outside
training distributions, even when trained on extensive motion capture datasets
with diverse objects and annotated interactions. This paper addresses this
limitation and shows that robustness and generalisation to novel scene objects
in 3D object-aware character synthesis can be achieved by training a motion
model with as few as one reference object. We leverage an implicit feature
representation trained on object-only datasets, which encodes an
SE(3)-equivariant descriptor field around the object. Given an unseen object
and a reference pose-object pair, we optimise for the object-aware pose that is
closest in the feature space to the reference pose. Finally, we use l-NSM,
i.e., our motion generation model that is trained to seamlessly transition from
locomotion to object interaction with the proposed bidirectional pose blending
scheme. Through comprehensive numerical comparisons to state-of-the-art methods
and in a user study, we demonstrate substantial improvements in 3D virtual
character motion and interaction quality and robustness to scenarios with
unseen objects. Our project page is available at

<p class="mathjax">Cloth simulation is an extensively studied problem, with a plethora of
solutions available in computer graphics literature. Existing cloth simulators
produce realistic cloth deformations that obey different types of boundary
conditions. Nevertheless, their operational principle remains limited in
several ways: They operate on explicit surface representations with a fixed
spatial resolution, perform a series of discretised updates (which bounds their
temporal resolution), and require comparably large amounts of storage.
Moreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is often not
straightforward, which poses additional challenges when integrating them into
modern neural architectures. In response to the limitations mentioned above,
this paper takes a fundamentally different perspective on physically-plausible
cloth simulation and re-thinks this long-standing problem: We propose
NeuralClothSim, i.e., a new cloth simulation approach using thin shells, in
which surface evolution is encoded in neural network weights. Our
memory-efficient and differentiable solver operates on a new continuous
coordinate-based representation of dynamic surfaces, i.e., neural deformation
fields (NDFs); it supervises NDF evolution with the rules of the non-linear
Kirchhoff-Love shell theory. NDFs are adaptive in the sense that they 1)
allocate their capacity to the deformation details as the latter arise during
the cloth evolution and 2) allow surface state queries at arbitrary spatial and
temporal resolutions without retraining. We show how to train our
NeuralClothSim solver while imposing hard boundary conditions and demonstrate
multiple applications, such as material interpolation and simulation editing.
The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our formulation and its
potential impact.

<p class="mathjax">As the feature size of integrated circuits continues to decrease, optical
proximity correction (OPC) has emerged as a crucial resolution enhancement
technology for ensuring high printability in the lithography process. Recently,
level set-based inverse lithography technology (ILT) has drawn considerable
attention as a promising OPC solution, showcasing its powerful pattern
fidelity, especially in advanced process. However, massive computational time
consumption of ILT limits its applicability to mainly correcting partial layers
and hotspot regions. Deep learning (DL) methods have shown great potential in
accelerating ILT. However, lack of domain knowledge of inverse lithography
limits the ability of DL-based algorithms in process window (PW) enhancement
and etc. In this paper, we propose an inverse lithography physics-informed deep
neural level set (ILDLS) approach for mask optimization. This approach utilizes
level set based-ILT as a layer within the DL framework and iteratively conducts
mask prediction and correction to significantly enhance printability and PW in
comparison with results from pure DL and ILT. With this approach, computation
time is reduced by a few orders of magnitude versus ILT. By gearing up DL with
knowledge of inverse lithography physics, ILDLS provides a new and efficient
mask optimization solution.

<p class="mathjax">We characterize learnability for quantum measurement classes by establishing
matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along
with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner
is given access only to prepared quantum states. We first probe the results
from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in
previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to
satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for
some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization
upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for
finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to
satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We
show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically
observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform
convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give
quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms
of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite
partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for
sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite
coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our
matching conditions. We also show that every measurement class defined on a
finite-dimensional Hilbert space is PAC learnable. We illustrate our results on
several example POVM classes.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting the solubility of given molecules is an important task in the
pharmaceutical industry, and consequently this is a well-studied topic. In this
research, we revisited this problem with the advantage of modern computing
resources. We applied two machine learning models, a linear regression model
and a graph convolutional neural network model, on multiple experimental
datasets. Both methods can make reasonable predictions while the GCNN model had
the best performance. However, the current GCNN model is a black box, while
feature importance analysis from the linear regression model offers more
insights into the underlying chemical influences. Using the linear regression
model, we show how each functional group affects the overall solubility.
Ultimately, knowing how chemical structure influences chemical properties is
crucial when designing new drugs. Future work should aim to combine the high
performance of GCNNs with the interpretability of linear regression, unlocking
new advances in next generation high throughput screening.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning-based unfolding has enabled unbinned and high-dimensional
differential cross section measurements. Two main approaches have emerged in
this research area: one based on discriminative models and one based on
generative models. The main advantage of discriminative models is that they
learn a small correction to a starting simulation while generative models scale
better to regions of phase space with little data. We propose to use
Schroedinger Bridges and diffusion models to create SBUnfold, an unfolding
approach that combines the strengths of both discriminative and generative
models. The key feature of SBUnfold is that its generative model maps one set
of events into another without having to go through a known probability density
as is the case for normalizing flows and standard diffusion models. We show
that SBUnfold achieves excellent performance compared to state of the art
methods on a synthetic Z+jets dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach for predicting small molecule
properties in drug discovery. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of
various ML methods introduced for this purpose in recent years. We review a
wide range of properties, including binding affinities, solubility, and ADMET
(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity). We discuss
existing popular datasets and molecular descriptors and embeddings, such as
chemical fingerprints and graph-based neural networks. We highlight also
challenges of predicting and optimizing multiple properties during hit-to-lead
and lead optimization stages of drug discovery and explore briefly possible
multi-objective optimization techniques that can be used to balance diverse
properties while optimizing lead candidates. Finally, techniques to provide an
understanding of model predictions, especially for critical decision-making in
drug discovery are assessed. Overall, this review provides insights into the
landscape of ML models for small molecule property predictions in drug
discovery. So far, there are multiple diverse approaches, but their
performances are often comparable. Neural networks, while more flexible, do not
always outperform simpler models. This shows that the availability of
high-quality training data remains crucial for training accurate models and
there is a need for standardized benchmarks, additional performance metrics,
and best practices to enable richer comparisons between the different
techniques and models that can shed a better light on the differences between
the many techniques.

<p class="mathjax">We explain how to use diffusion models to learn inverse renormalization group
flows of statistical and quantum field theories. Diffusion models are a class
of machine learning models which have been used to generate samples from
complex distributions, such as the distribution of natural images, by learning
the inverse process to a diffusion process which adds noise to the data until
the distribution of the data is pure noise. Nonperturbative renormalization
group schemes can naturally be written as diffusion processes in the space of
fields. We combine these observations in a concrete framework for building
ML-based models for studying field theories, in which the models learn the
inverse process to an explicitly-specified renormalization group scheme. We
detail how these models define a class of adaptive bridge (or parallel
tempering) samplers for lattice field theory. Because renormalization group
schemes have a physical meaning, we provide explicit prescriptions for how to
compare results derived from models associated to several different
renormalization group schemes of interest. We also explain how to use diffusion
models in a variational method to find ground states of quantum systems. We
apply some of our methods to numerically find RG flows of interacting
statistical field theories. From the perspective of machine learning, our work
provides an interpretation of multiscale diffusion models, and gives
physically-inspired suggestions for diffusion models which should have novel
properties.

<p class="mathjax">Some of the most interesting de Bruijn sequences can be constructed in
seemingly unrelated ways. In particular, the "Granddaddy" and "Grandmama" can
be understood by joining necklace cycles into a tree using simple parent rules,
or by concatenating smaller strings (e.g., Lyndon words) in lexicographic
orders. These constructions are elegant, but their equivalences seem to come
out of thin air, and the community has had limited success in finding others of
the same ilk. We aim to demystify the connection between cycle-joining trees
and concatenation schemes by introducing "concatenation trees". These
structures combine binary trees and ordered trees, and traversals yield
concatenation schemes for their sequences.
<br />In this work, we focus on the four simplest cycle-joining trees using the
pure cycling register (PCR): "Granddaddy" (PCR1), "Grandmama" (PCR2), "Granny"
(PCR3), and "Grandpa" (PCR4). In particular, we formally prove a previously
observed correspondence for PCR3 and we unravel the mystery behind PCR4. More
broadly, this work lays the foundation for translating cycle-joining trees to
known concatenation constructions for a variety of underlying feedback
functions including the complementing cycling register (CCR), pure summing
register (PSR), complementing summing register (CSR), and pure run-length
register (PRR).

<p class="mathjax">Widespread deployment of relays can yield a significant boost in the
throughput of forthcoming wireless networks. However, the optimal operation of
large relay networks is still infeasible. This paper presents two approaches
for the optimization of large relay networks. In the traditional approach, we
formulate and solve an optimization problem where the relays are considered
linear. In the second approach, we take an entirely new direction and consider
the true non-linear nature of the relays. Using the similarity to neural
networks, we leverage deep-learning methodology.
<br />Unlike previous applications of neural networks in wireless communications,
where neural networks are added to the network to perform computational tasks,
our deep relay optimization treats the relay network itself as a neural
network. By exploiting the non-linear transfer function exhibited by each
relay, we achieve over 15dB gain compared to traditional optimization methods.
Moreover, we are able to implement part of the network functionality over the
relay network. Our findings shed light on the potential of deep relay
optimization, promising significant advancements in future wireless
communication systems.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in estimating
brain age, which is an important brain health biomarker, from magnetic
resonance (MR) images. However, most of these models only provide a global age
prediction, and rely on techniques, such as saliency maps to interpret their
results. These saliency maps highlight regions in the input image that were
significant for the model's predictions, but they are hard to be interpreted,
and saliency map values are not directly comparable across different samples.
In this work, we reframe the age prediction problem from MR images to an
image-to-image regression problem where we estimate the brain age for each
brain voxel in MR images. We compare voxel-wise age prediction models against
global age prediction models and their corresponding saliency maps. The results
indicate that voxel-wise age prediction models are more interpretable, since
they provide spatial information about the brain aging process, and they
benefit from being quantitative.

<p class="mathjax">We develop a hardware-efficient ansatz for variational optimization, derived
from existing ansatze in the literature, that parametrizes subsets of all
interactions in the Cost Hamiltonian in each layer. We treat gate orderings as
a variational parameter and observe that doing so can provide significant
performance boosts in experiments. We carried out experimental runs of a
compilation-optimized implementation of fully-connected Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
Hamiltonians on a 50-qubit linear-chain subsystem of Rigetti Aspen-M-3 transmon
processor. Our results indicate that, for the best circuit designs tested, the
average performance at optimized angles and gate orderings increases with
circuit depth (using more parameters), despite the presence of a high level of
noise. We report performance significantly better than using a random guess
oracle for circuits involving up to approx 5000 two-qubit and approx 5000
one-qubit native gates. We additionally discuss various takeaways of our
results toward more effective utilization of current and future quantum
processors for optimization.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we prove uniform continuity bounds for entropic quantities
related to the sandwiched R\'enyi divergences such as the sandwiched R\'enyi
conditional entropy. We follow three different approaches: The first one is the
axiomatic approach, which exploits the sub-/ superadditivity and joint
concavity/ convexity of the exponential of the divergence. In our second
approach, termed the "operator space approach", we express the entropic
measures as norms and utilize their properties for establishing the bounds.
These norms draw inspiration from interpolation space norms. We not only
demonstrate the norm properties solely relying on matrix analysis tools but
also extend their applicability to a context that holds relevance in resource
theories. By this, we extend the strategies of Marwah and Dupuis as well as
Beigi and Goodarzi employed in the sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropy
context. Finally, we merge the approaches into a mixed approach that has some
advantageous properties and then discuss in which regimes each bound performs
best. Our results improve over the previous best continuity bounds or sometimes
even give the first continuity bounds available. In a separate contribution, we
use the ALAAF method, developed in a previous article by some of the authors,
to study the stability of approximate quantum Markov chains.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to build deep
learning models for medical image registration, but manually designed network
architectures are not necessarily optimal. This paper presents a hierarchical
NAS framework (HNAS-Reg), consisting of both convolutional operation search and
network topology search, to identify the optimal network architecture for
deformable medical image registration. To mitigate the computational overhead
and memory constraints, a partial channel strategy is utilized without losing
optimization quality. Experiments on three datasets, consisting of 636
T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs), have demonstrated that the
proposal method can build a deep learning model with improved image
registration accuracy and reduced model size, compared with state-of-the-art
image registration approaches, including one representative traditional
approach and two unsupervised learning-based approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid tracer kinetics of rubidium-82 ($^{82}$Rb) and high variation of
cross-frame distribution in dynamic cardiac positron emission tomography (PET)
raise significant challenges for inter-frame motion correction, particularly
for the early frames where conventional intensity-based image registration
techniques are not applicable. Alternatively, a promising approach utilizes
generative methods to handle the tracer distribution changes to assist existing
registration methods. To improve frame-wise registration and parametric
quantification, we propose a Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative
Adversarial Network (TAI-GAN) to transform the early frames into the late
reference frame using an all-to-one mapping. Specifically, a feature-wise
linear modulation layer encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal
tracer kinetics information, and rough cardiac segmentations with local shifts
serve as the anatomical information. We validated our proposed method on a
clinical $^{82}$Rb PET dataset and found that our TAI-GAN can produce converted
early frames with high image quality, comparable to the real reference frames.
After TAI-GAN conversion, motion estimation accuracy and clinical myocardial
blood flow (MBF) quantification were improved compared to using the original
frames. Our code is published at https://github.com/gxq1998/TAI-GAN.

<p class="mathjax">Digitalizing real-world analog signals typically involves sampling in time
and discretizing in amplitude. Subsequent signal reconstructions inevitably
incur an error that depends on the amplitude resolution and the temporal
density of the acquired samples. From an implementation viewpoint, consistent
signal reconstruction methods have proven a profitable error-rate decay as the
sampling rate increases. Despite that, these results are obtained under offline
settings. Therefore, a research gap exists regarding methods for consistent
signal reconstruction from data streams. This paper presents a method that
consistently reconstructs streamed multivariate time series of quantization
intervals under a zero-delay response requirement. On the other hand, previous
work has shown that the temporal dependencies within univariate time series can
be exploited to reduce the roughness of zero-delay signal reconstructions. This
work shows that the spatiotemporal dependencies within multivariate time series
can also be exploited to achieve improved results. Specifically, the
spatiotemporal dependencies of the multivariate time series are learned, with
the assistance of a recurrent neural network, to reduce the roughness of the
signal reconstruction on average while ensuring consistency. Our experiments
show that our proposed method achieves a favorable error-rate decay with the
sampling rate compared to a similar but non-consistent reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">High-resolution (HR) MRI scans obtained from research-grade medical centers
provide precise information about imaged tissues. However, routine clinical MRI
scans are typically in low-resolution (LR) and vary greatly in contrast and
spatial resolution due to the adjustments of the scanning parameters to the
local needs of the medical center. End-to-end deep learning methods for MRI
super-resolution (SR) have been proposed, but they require re-training each
time there is a shift in the input distribution. To address this issue, we
propose a novel approach that leverages a state-of-the-art 3D brain generative
model, the latent diffusion model (LDM) trained on UK BioBank, to increase the
resolution of clinical MRI scans. The LDM acts as a generative prior, which has
the ability to capture the prior distribution of 3D T1-weighted brain MRI.
Based on the architecture of the brain LDM, we find that different methods are
suitable for different settings of MRI SR, and thus propose two novel
strategies: 1) for SR with more sparsity, we invert through both the decoder of
the LDM and also through a deterministic Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM), an approach we will call InverseSR(LDM); 2) for SR with less sparsity,
we invert only through the LDM decoder, an approach we will call
InverseSR(Decoder). These two approaches search different latent spaces in the
LDM model to find the optimal latent code to map the given LR MRI into HR. The
training process of the generative model is independent of the MRI
under-sampling process, ensuring the generalization of our method to many MRI
SR problems with different input measurements. We validate our method on over
100 brain T1w MRIs from the IXI dataset. Our method can demonstrate that
powerful priors given by LDM can be used for MRI reconstruction.

fall detection using knowledge distillation-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
models to significantly improve accuracy. With a primary focus on analyzing

The authors investigate fall detection models that are based on different

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale numerical simulations are capable of generating data up to
terabytes or even petabytes. As a promising method of data reduction,
super-resolution (SR) has been widely studied in the scientific visualization
community. However, most of them are based on deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the scale factor
needs to be determined before constructing the network. As a result, a single
training session only supports a fixed factor and has poor generalization
ability. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Feature-Enhanced
Implicit Neural Representation (FFEINR) for spatio-temporal super-resolution of
flow field data. It can take full advantage of the implicit neural
representation in terms of model structure and sampling resolution. The neural
representation is based on a fully connected network with periodic activation
functions, which enables us to obtain lightweight models. The learned
continuous representation can decode the low-resolution flow field input data
to arbitrary spatial and temporal resolutions, allowing for flexible
upsampling. The training process of FFEINR is facilitated by introducing
feature enhancements for the input layer, which complements the contextual
information of the flow field.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, a series of experiments are conducted on different datasets by setting
different hyperparameters. The results show that FFEINR achieves significantly
better results than the trilinear interpolation method.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, audio coding technology has been standardized based on
several frameworks that incorporate linear predictive coding (LPC). However,
coding the transient signal using frequency-domain LP residual signals remains
a challenge. To address this, temporal noise shaping (TNS) can be adapted,
although it cannot be effectively operated since the estimated temporal
envelope in the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) domain is accompanied
by the time-domain aliasing (TDA) terms. In this study, we propose the
modulated complex lapped transform-based coding framework integrated with
transform coded excitation (TCX) and complex LPC-based TNS (CTNS). Our approach
uses a 50\% overlap window and switching scheme for the CTNS to improve the
coding efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive calculation of the target bits for
the sub-bands using the frequency envelope information based on the quantized
LPC coefficients is proposed. To minimize the quantization mismatch between
both modes, an integrated quantization for real and complex values and a TDA
augmentation method that compensates for the artificially generated TDA
components during switching operations are proposed. The proposed coding
framework shows a superior performance in both objective metrics and subjective
listening tests, thereby demonstrating its low bit-rate audio coding.

<p class="mathjax">Neural dynamical systems with stable attractor structures, such as point
attractors and continuous attractors, are hypothesized to underlie meaningful
temporal behavior that requires working memory. However, working memory may not
support useful learning signals necessary to adapt to changes in the temporal
structure of the environment. We show that in addition to the continuous
attractors that are widely implicated, periodic and quasi-periodic attractors
can also support learning arbitrarily long temporal relationships. Unlike the
continuous attractors that suffer from the fine-tuning problem, the less
explored quasi-periodic attractors are uniquely qualified for learning to
produce temporally structured behavior. Our theory has broad implications for
the design of artificial learning systems and makes predictions about
observable signatures of biological neural dynamics that can support temporal
dependence learning and working memory. Based on our theory, we developed a new
initialization scheme for artificial recurrent neural networks that outperforms
standard methods for tasks that require learning temporal dynamics. Moreover,
we propose a robust recurrent memory mechanism for integrating and maintaining
head direction without a ring attractor.

<p class="mathjax">Equalization is an important task at the receiver side of a digital wireless
communication system, which is traditionally conducted with model-based
estimation methods. Among the numerous options for model-based equalization,
iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) is a well-performing approach
since error propagation caused by hard decision data symbol estimation during
the iterative estimation procedure is avoided. However, the model-based method
suffers from high computational complexity and performance degradation due to
required approximations. In this work, we propose a novel neural network
(NN-)based equalization approach, referred to as SICNN, which is designed by
deep unfolding of a model-based iterative SIC method, eliminating the main
disadvantages of its model-based counterpart. We present different variants of
SICNN. SICNNv1 is very similar to the model-based method, and is specifically
tailored for single carrier frequency domain equalization systems, which is the
communication system we regard in this work. The second variant, SICNNv2, is
more universal, and is applicable as an equalizer in any communication system
with a block-based data transmission scheme. We highlight the pros and cons of
both variants. Moreover, for both SICNNv1 and SICNNv2 we present a version with
a highly reduced number of learnable parameters. We compare the achieved bit
error ratio performance of the proposed NN-based equalizers with
state-of-the-art model-based and NN-based approaches, highlighting the
superiority of SICNNv1 over all other methods. Also, we present a thorough
complexity analysis of the proposed NN-based equalization approaches, and we
investigate the influence of the training set size on the performance of
NN-based equalizers.

<p class="mathjax">Customer retention or churn prevention is a challenging task of a telecom
operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive
or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and
make sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time. Often, operators
allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The
difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a
large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an
individual so that operator's objective is achieved. There may be multiple
objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for
selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber.
Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot
tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this
paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer
optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under
the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain.
The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large
subscriber-base.

<p class="mathjax">The comprehension of how local interactions arise in global collective
behavior is of utmost importance in both biological and physical research.
Traditional agent-based models often rely on static rules that fail to capture
the dynamic strategies of the biological world. Reinforcement learning has been
proposed as a solution, but most previous methods adopt handcrafted reward
functions that implicitly or explicitly encourage the emergence of swarming
behaviors. In this study, we propose a minimal predator-prey coevolution
framework based on mixed cooperative-competitive multiagent reinforcement
learning, and adopt a reward function that is solely based on the fundamental
survival pressure, that is, prey receive a reward of $-1$ if caught by
predators while predators receive a reward of $+1$. Surprisingly, our analysis
of this approach reveals an unexpectedly rich diversity of emergent behaviors
for both prey and predators, including flocking and swirling behaviors for
prey, as well as dispersion tactics, confusion, and marginal predation
phenomena for predators. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the
collective behavior of organisms and highlights the potential applications in
swarm robotics.

<p class="mathjax">Information on the structure of molecules, retrieved via biochemical
databases, plays a pivotal role in various disciplines, such as metabolomics,
systems biology, and drug discovery. However, no such database can be complete,
and the chemical structure for a given compound is not necessarily consistent
between databases. This paper presents StructRecon, a novel tool for resolving
unique and correct molecular structures from database identifiers. StructRecon
traverses the cross-links between database entries in different databases to
construct what we call an identifier graph, which offers a more complete view
of the total information available on a particular compound across all the
databases. In order to reconcile discrepancies between databases, we first
present an extensible model for chemical structure which supports multiple
independent levels of detail, allowing standardisation of the structure to be
applied iteratively. In some cases, our standardisation approach results in
multiple structures for a given compound, in which case a random walk-based
algorithm is used to select the most likely structure among incompatible
alternates. We applied StructRecon to the EColiCore2 model, resolving a unique
chemical structure for 85.11 % of identifiers. StructRecon is open-source and
modular, which enables the potential support for more databases in the future.

<p class="mathjax">As quantum theory allows for information processing and computing tasks that
otherwise are not possible with classical systems, there is a need and use of
quantum Internet beyond existing network systems. At the same time, the
realization of a desirably functional quantum Internet is hindered by
fundamental and practical challenges such as high loss during transmission of
quantum systems, decoherence due to interaction with the environment, fragility
of quantum states, etc. We study the implications of these constraints by
analyzing the limitations on the scaling and robustness of quantum Internet.
Considering quantum networks, we present practical bottlenecks for secure
communication, delegated computing, and resource distribution among end nodes.
Motivated by the power of abstraction in graph theory (in association with
quantum information theory), we consider graph-theoretic quantifiers to assess
network robustness and provide critical values of communication lines for
viable communication over quantum Internet.
<br />In particular, we begin by discussing limitations on usefulness of isotropic
states as device-independent quantum key repeaters which otherwise could be
useful for device-independent quantum key distribution. We consider some
quantum networks of practical interest, ranging from satellite-based networks
connecting far-off spatial locations to currently available quantum processor
architectures within computers, and analyze their robustness to perform quantum
information processing tasks. Some of these tasks form primitives for delegated
quantum computing, e.g., entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation.
For some examples of quantum networks, we present algorithms to perform
different quantum network tasks of interest such as constructing the network
structure, finding the shortest path between a pair of end nodes, and
optimizing the flow of resources at a node.

<p class="mathjax">CNNs have been widely applied for medical image analysis. However, limited
memory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processing
high-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsized
first before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increase
class imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. In
this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet.
IP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation on
Intensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming
3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losing
the original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models in
terms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2D
segmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2)
IP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted Maximum
Intensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and Average
Intensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, then
applying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directly
reads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputs
the 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of these
methods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection.
Experimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentation
accuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the training
time by 70\% and memory consumption by 92\%.

NP-complete. The situation for matrix groups is quite involved: while we
exhibit sequences of 2-by-2 matrices where the problem is NP-complete, in the

<p class="mathjax">Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is an imaging modality for visualising
blood vessels. It is useful for several diagnostic applications and for
assessing the risk of adverse events such as haemorrhagic stroke (resulting
from the rupture of aneurysms in blood vessels). However, MRAs are not acquired
routinely, hence, an approach to synthesise blood vessel segmentations from
more routinely acquired MR contrasts such as T1 and T2, would be useful. We
present an encoder-decoder model for synthesising segmentations of the main
cerebral arteries in the circle of Willis (CoW) from only T2 MRI. We propose a
two-phase multi-objective learning approach, which captures both global and
local features. It uses learned local attention maps generated by dilating the
segmentation labels, which forces the network to only extract information from
the T2 MRI relevant to synthesising the CoW. Our synthetic vessel segmentations
generated from only T2 MRI achieved a mean Dice score of $0.79 \pm 0.03$ in
testing, compared to state-of-the-art segmentation networks such as transformer
U-Net ($0.71 \pm 0.04$) and nnU-net($0.68 \pm 0.05$), while using only a
fraction of the parameters. The main qualitative difference between our
synthetic vessel segmentations and the comparative models was in the sharper
resolution of the CoW vessel segments, especially in the posterior circulation.
