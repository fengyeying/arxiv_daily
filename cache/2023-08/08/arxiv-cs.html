<p class="mathjax">Algorithms have been becoming increasingly relevant for various
decision-making processes in the forms of Decision Support Systems or
Decision-making systems in areas such as Criminal-Justice systems, Job
Application Filtering, Medicine, and Healthcare to name a few. It is crucial
for these algorithms to be fair and for the users to have confidence in these
decisions, especially in the above contexts, because they have a high impact on
society. We conduct an online empirical study with 61 participants to find out
how the change in transparency and reliability of an algorithm which determines
the probability of lesions being melanoma could impact users' decision-making
process, as well as the confidence in the decisions made by the algorithm. The
results indicate that people show at least moderate confidence in the decisions
of the algorithm even when the reliability is bad. However, they would not
blindly follow the algorithm's wrong decisions.

<p class="mathjax">The failure atomic and isolated execution of clients operations is a default
requirement for a system that serve multiple loosely coupled clients at a
server. However, disaggregated memory breaks this requirement in remote indexes
because a client operation is disaggregated to multiple remote reads/writes.
Current indexes focus on performance improvements and largely ignore tolerating
client failures. We argue that a practical DM index should be transactional:
each index operation should be failure atomic and isolated in addition to being
concurrency isolated. We present repairable transaction (rTX), a lightweight
primitive to execute DM index operations. Each rTX can detect other failed
rTXes on-the-fly with the help of concurrency control. Upon detection, it will
repair their non-atomic updates online with the help of logging, thus hiding
their failures from healthy clients. By further removing unnecessary logging
and delegating concurrency control to existing carefully-tuned index
algorithms, we show that transactional indexes can be built at a low
performance overhead on disaggregated memory. We have refactored two
state-of-the-art DM indexes, RaceHashing and Sherman (B+Tree), with rTX.
Evaluations show that rTX is 1.2 to 2X faster than other alternatives, e.g.,
distributed transaction. Meanwhile, its overhead is up to 42% compared to
non-fault-tolerant indexes.

<p class="mathjax">Coherence is a crucial aspect of evaluating text readability and can be
assessed through two primary factors when evaluating an essay in a scoring
scenario. The first factor is logical coherence, characterized by the
appropriate use of discourse connectives and the establishment of logical
relationships between sentences. The second factor is the appropriateness of
punctuation, as inappropriate punctuation can lead to confused sentence
structure. To address these concerns, we propose a coherence scoring model
consisting of a regression model with two feature extractors: a local coherence
discriminative model and a punctuation correction model. We employ
gradient-boosting regression trees as the regression model and impose
monotonicity constraints on the input features. The results show that our
proposed model better generalizes unseen data. The model achieved third place
in track 1 of NLPCC 2023 shared task 7. Additionally, we briefly introduce our
solution for the remaining tracks, which achieves second place for track 2 and
first place for both track 3 and track 4.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the development of a software tool that enables the
translation of first-order predicate logic into relation algebra. The tool was
developed using the Z3 theorem prover, by leveraging its capabilities to
enhance reliability, generate code, and expedite the development process. The
resulting standalone Python program allows users to translate first-order logic
expressions into relation algebra, eliminating the need to work with relation
algebra explicitly. This paper outlines the theoretical background of
first-order logic, relation algebra, and the translation process. It also
describes the implementation details, including validation of the tool using Z3
for testing correctness, and discusses deviations from the original translation
procedure. By demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing first-order logic as
an alternative language for expressing relation algebra, this tool paves the
way for integrating first-order logic into tools that traditionally rely on
relation algebra as their input language.

<p class="mathjax">Master equations are of fundamental importance in modeling stochastic
dynamical systems.However, solving master equations is challenging due to the
exponential increase in the number of possible states or trajectories with the
dimension of the state space. In this study, we propose repurposing language
models as a machine learning approach to solve master equations. We design a
prompt-based neural network to map rate parameters, initial conditions, and
time values directly to the state joint probability distribution that exactly
matches the input contexts. In this way, we approximate the solution of the
master equation in its most general form. We train the network using the policy
gradient algorithm within the reinforcement learning framework, with feedback
rewards provided by a set of variational autoregressive models. By applying
this approach to representative examples, we observe high accuracy for both
multi-module and high-dimensional systems. The trained network also exhibits
extrapolating ability, extending its predictability to unseen data. Our
findings establish the connection between language models and master equations,
highlighting the possibility of using a single pretrained large model to solve
any master equation.

<p class="mathjax">Classification of motor imagery (MI) using non-invasive
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is a critical objective as it is used to
predict the intention of limb movements of a subject. In recent research,
convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been widely utilized for
MI-EEG classification. The challenges of training neural networks for MI-EEG
signals classification include low signal-to-noise ratio, non-stationarity,
non-linearity, and high complexity of EEG signals. The features computed by
CNN-based networks on the highly noisy MI-EEG signals contain irrelevant
information. Subsequently, the feature maps of the CNN-based network computed
from the noisy and irrelevant features contain irrelevant information. Thus,
many non-contributing features often mislead the neural network training and
degrade the classification performance. Hence, a novel feature reweighting
approach is proposed to address this issue. The proposed method gives a noise
reduction mechanism named feature reweighting module that suppresses irrelevant
temporal and channel feature maps. The feature reweighting module of the
proposed method generates scores that reweight the feature maps to reduce the
impact of irrelevant information. Experimental results show that the proposed
method significantly improved the classification of MI-EEG signals of Physionet
EEG-MMIDB and BCI Competition IV 2a datasets by a margin of 9.34% and 3.82%,
respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">The utilization of model checking has been suggested as a formal verification
technique for analyzing critical systems. However, the primary challenge in
applying to complex systems is state space explosion problem. To address this
issue, bisimulation minimization has emerged as a prominent method for reducing
the number of states in a labeled transition system, aiming to overcome the
difficulties associated with the state space explosion problem. In the case of
systems exhibiting stochastic behaviors, probabilistic bisimulation is employed
to minimize a given model, obtaining its equivalent form with fewer states.
Recently, various techniques have been introduced to decrease the time
complexity of the iterative methods used to compute probabilistic bisimulation
for stochastic systems that display nondeterministic behaviors. In this paper,
we propose a new technique to partition the state space of a given
probabilistic model to its bisimulation classes. This technique uses the PRISM
program of a given model and constructs some small versions of the model to
train a classifier. It then applies machine learning classification techniques
to approximate the related partition. The resulting partition is used as an
initial one for the standard bisimulation technique in order to reduce the
running time of the method. The experimental results show that the approach can
decrease significantly the running time compared to state-of-the-art tools.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI and large language models have the potential to drastically
improve the landscape of computing education by automatically generating
personalized feedback and content. Recent works have studied the capabilities
of these models for different programming education scenarios; however, these
works considered only text-based programming, in particular, Python
programming. Consequently, they leave open the question of how well these
models would perform in visual programming domains popularly used for K-8
programming education. The main research question we study is: Do
state-of-the-art generative models show advanced capabilities in visual
programming on par with their capabilities in text-based Python programming? In
our work, we evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, in
visual programming domains for various scenarios and assess performance using
expert-based annotations. In particular, we base our evaluation using reference
tasks from the domains of Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code-dot-org and
Karel. Our results show that these models perform poorly and struggle to
combine spatial, logical, and programming skills crucial for visual
programming. These results also provide exciting directions for future work on
developing techniques to improve the performance of generative models in visual
programming.

<p class="mathjax">A chatbot is a software developed to help reply to text or voice
conversations automatically and quickly in real time. In the agriculture
sector, the existing smart agriculture systems just use data from sensing and
internet of things (IoT) technologies that exclude crop cultivation knowledge
to support decision-making by farmers. To enhance this, the chatbot application
can be an assistant to farmers to provide crop cultivation knowledge.
Consequently, we propose the LINE chatbot application as an information and
knowledge representation providing crop cultivation recommendations to farmers.
It works with smart agriculture and recommendation systems. Our proposed LINE
chatbot application consists of five main functions (start/stop menu, main
page, drip irri gation page, mist irrigation page, and monitor page). Farmers
will receive information for data monitoring to support their decision-making.
Moreover, they can control the irrigation system via the LINE chatbot.
Furthermore, farmers can ask questions relevant to the crop environment via a
chat box. After implementing our proposed chatbot, farmers are very satisfied
with the application, scoring a 96% satisfaction score. However, in terms of
asking questions via chat box, this LINE chatbot application is a rule-based
bot or script bot. Farmers have to type in the correct keywords as prescribed,
otherwise they won't get a response from the chatbots. In the future, we will
enhance the asking function of our LINE chatbot to be an intelligent bot.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning in computer vision aims to leverage the inherent
structure and relationships within data to learn meaningful representations
without explicit human annotation, enabling a holistic understanding of visual
scenes. Robustness in vision machine learning ensures reliable and consistent
performance, enhancing generalization, adaptability, and resistance to noise,
variations, and adversarial attacks. Self-supervised paradigms, namely
contrastive learning, knowledge distillation, mutual information maximization,
and clustering, have been considered to have shown advances in invariant
learning representations. This work investigates the robustness of learned
representations of self-supervised learning approaches focusing on distribution
shifts and image corruptions in computer vision. Detailed experiments have been
conducted to study the robustness of self-supervised learning methods on
distribution shifts and image corruptions. The empirical analysis demonstrates
a clear relationship between the performance of learned representations within
self-supervised paradigms and the severity of distribution shifts and
corruptions. Notably, higher levels of shifts and corruptions are found to
significantly diminish the robustness of the learned representations. These
findings highlight the critical impact of distribution shifts and image

<p class="mathjax">The performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) varies
across problems, making it hard to develop new algorithms or apply existing
ones to new problems. To simplify the development and application of new
multiobjective algorithms, there has been an increasing interest in their
automatic design from their components. These automatically designed
metaheuristics can outperform their human-developed counterparts. However, it
is still unknown what are the most influential components that lead to
performance improvements. This study specifies a new methodology to investigate
the effects of the final configuration of an automatically designed algorithm.
We apply this methodology to a tuned Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm
based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) designed by the iterated racing (irace)
configuration package on constrained problems of 3 groups: (1) analytical
real-world problems, (2) analytical artificial problems and (3) simulated
real-world. We then compare the impact of the algorithm components in terms of
their Search Trajectory Networks (STNs), the diversity of the population, and
the anytime hypervolume values. Looking at the objective space behavior, the
MOEAs studied converged before half of the search to generally good HV values
in the analytical artificial problems and the analytical real-world problems.
For the simulated problems, the HV values are still improving at the end of the
run. In terms of decision space behavior, we see a diverse set of the
trajectories of the STNs in the analytical artificial problems. These
trajectories are more similar and frequently reach optimal solutions in the
other problems.

<p class="mathjax">Segmenting and recognizing surgical operation trajectories into distinct,
meaningful gestures is a critical preliminary step in surgical workflow
analysis for robot-assisted surgery. This step is necessary for facilitating
learning from demonstrations for autonomous robotic surgery, evaluating
surgical skills, and so on. In this work, we develop a hierarchical
semi-supervised learning framework for surgical gesture segmentation using
multi-modality data (i.e. kinematics and vision data). More specifically,
surgical tasks are initially segmented based on distance characteristics-based
profiles and variance characteristics-based profiles constructed using
kinematics data. Subsequently, a Transformer-based network with a pre-trained
`ResNet-18' backbone is used to extract visual features from the surgical
operation videos. By combining the potential segmentation points obtained from
both modalities, we can determine the final segmentation points. Furthermore,
gesture recognition can be implemented based on supervised learning. The
proposed approach has been evaluated using data from the publicly available
JIGSAWS database, including Suturing, Needle Passing, and Knot Tying tasks. The
results reveal an average F1 score of 0.623 for segmentation and an accuracy of
0.856 for recognition.

<p class="mathjax">Driver attention prediction implies the intention understanding of where the
driver intends to go and what object the driver concerned about, which commonly
provides a driving task-guided traffic scene understanding. Some recent works
explore driver attention prediction in critical or accident scenarios and find
a positive role in helping accident prediction, while the promotion ability is
constrained by the prediction accuracy of driver attention maps. In this work,
we explore the network connection gating mechanism for driver attention
prediction (Gate-DAP). Gate-DAP aims to learn the importance of different
spatial, temporal, and modality information in driving scenarios with various
road types, occasions, and light and weather conditions. The network connection
gating in Gate-DAP consists of a spatial encoding network gating,
long-short-term memory network gating, and information type gating modules.
Each connection gating operation is plug-and-play and can be flexibly
assembled, which makes the architecture of Gate-DAP transparent for evaluating
different spatial, temporal, and information types for driver attention
prediction. Evaluations on DADA-2000 and BDDA datasets verify the superiority
of the proposed method with the comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, posing a
significant security risk in critical applications. Adversarial Training (AT)
is a well-established technique to enhance adversarial robustness, but it often
comes at the cost of decreased generalization ability. This paper proposes
Robustness Critical Fine-Tuning (RiFT), a novel approach to enhance
generalization without compromising adversarial robustness. The core idea of
RiFT is to exploit the redundant capacity for robustness by fine-tuning the
adversarially trained model on its non-robust-critical module. To do so, we
introduce module robust criticality (MRC), a measure that evaluates the
significance of a given module to model robustness under worst-case weight
perturbations. Using this measure, we identify the module with the lowest MRC
value as the non-robust-critical module and fine-tune its weights to obtain
fine-tuned weights. Subsequently, we linearly interpolate between the
adversarially trained weights and fine-tuned weights to derive the optimal
fine-tuned model weights. We demonstrate the efficacy of RiFT on ResNet18,
ResNet34, and WideResNet34-10 models trained on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and
Tiny-ImageNet datasets. Our experiments show that \method can significantly
improve both generalization and out-of-distribution robustness by around 1.5%
while maintaining or even slightly enhancing adversarial robustness. Code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/robustlearn.

<p class="mathjax">In Vitro Fertilization is among the most widespread treatments for
infertility. One of its main challenges is the evaluation and selection of
embryo for implantation, a process with large inter- and intra-clinician
variability. Deep learning based methods are gaining attention, but their
opaque nature compromises their acceptance in the clinical context, where
transparency in the decision making is key. In this paper we analyze the
current work in the explainability of AI-assisted embryo analysis models,
identifying the limitations. We also discuss how these models could be
integrated in the clinical context as decision support systems, considering the
needs of clinicians and patients. Finally, we propose guidelines for the sake
of increasing interpretability and trustworthiness, pushing this technology
forward towards established clinical practice.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation techniques have shown significant progress in recent
years, but their robustness to real-world perturbations and data samples not
seen during training remains a challenge, particularly in safety-critical
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the
robustness of semantic segmentation techniques by leveraging the synergy
between label-to-image generators and image-to-label segmentation models.
Specifically, we design and train Robusta, a novel robust conditional
generative adversarial network to generate realistic and plausible perturbed or
outlier images that can be used to train reliable segmentation models. We
conduct in-depth studies of the proposed generative model, assess the
performance and robustness of the downstream segmentation network, and
demonstrate that our approach can significantly enhance the robustness of
semantic segmentation techniques in the face of real-world perturbations,
distribution shifts, and out-of-distribution samples. Our results suggest that
this approach could be valuable in safety-critical applications, where the
reliability of semantic segmentation techniques is of utmost importance and
comes with a limited computational budget in inference. We will release our
code shortly.

<p class="mathjax">Supervised machine learning and deep learning require a large amount of
labeled data, which data scientists obtain in a manual, and time-consuming
annotation process. To mitigate this challenge, Active Learning (AL) proposes
promising data points to annotators they annotate next instead of a subsequent
or random sample. This method is supposed to save annotation effort while
maintaining model performance. However, practitioners face many AL strategies
for different tasks and need an empirical basis to choose between them. Surveys
categorize AL strategies into taxonomies without performance indications.
Presentations of novel AL strategies compare the performance to a small subset
of strategies. Our contribution addresses the empirical basis by introducing a
reproducible active learning evaluation (ALE) framework for the comparative
evaluation of AL strategies in NLP. The framework allows the implementation of
AL strategies with low effort and a fair data-driven comparison through
defining and tracking experiment parameters (e.g., initial dataset size, number
of data points per query step, and the budget). ALE helps practitioners to make
more informed decisions, and researchers can focus on developing new, effective
AL strategies and deriving best practices for specific use cases. With best
practices, practitioners can lower their annotation costs. We present a case
study to illustrate how to use the framework.

<p class="mathjax">Representing snippets of information abstractly is a task that needs to be
performed for various purposes, such as database view specification and the
first stage in the natural language generation pipeline for generative AI from
structured input, i.e., the content selection stage to determine what needs to
be verbalised. For the Abstract Wikipedia project, requirements analysis
revealed that such an abstract representation requires multilingual modelling,
content selection covering declarative content and functions, and both classes
and instances. There is no modelling language that meets either of the three
features, let alone a combination. Following a rigorous language design process
inclusive of broad stakeholder consultation, we created CoSMo, a novel {\sc
Co}ntent {\sc S}election {\sc Mo}deling language that meets these and other
requirements so that it may be useful both in Abstract Wikipedia as well as
other contexts. We describe the design process, rationale and choices, the
specification, and preliminary evaluation of the language.

<p class="mathjax">We describe a "top down" approach for automated theorem proving (ATP).
Researchers might usefully investigate the forms of the theorems mathematicians
use in practice, carefully examine how they differ and are proved in practice,
and code all relevant domain concepts. These concepts encode a large portion of
the knowledge in any domain. Furthermore, researchers should write programs
that produce proofs of the kind that human mathematicians write (and publish);
this means proofs that might sometimes have mistakes; and this means making
inferences that are sometimes invalid. This approach is meant to contrast with
the historically dominant ~bottom up" approach: coding fundamental types
(typically sets), axioms and rules for (valid) inference, and building up from
this foundation to the theorems of mathematical practice and to their
outstanding questions. It is an important fact that the actual proofs that
mathematicians publish in math journals do not look like the formalized proofs
of Russell &amp; Whitehead's Principia Mathematica (or modern computer systems like
Lean that automate some of this formalization). We believe some "lack of rigor"
(in mathematical practice) is human-like, and can and should be leveraged for
ATP.

<p class="mathjax">In the recent shift towards human-centric AI, the need for machines to
accurately use natural language has become increasingly important. While a
common approach to achieve this is to train large language models, this method
presents a form of learning misalignment where the model may not capture the
underlying structure and reasoning humans employ in using natural language,
potentially leading to unexpected or unreliable behavior. Emergent
communication (Emecom) is a field of research that has seen a growing number of
publications in recent years, aiming to develop artificial agents capable of
using natural language in a way that goes beyond simple discriminative tasks
and can effectively communicate and learn new concepts. In this review, we
present Emecom under two aspects. Firstly, we delineate all the common
proprieties we find across the literature and how they relate to human
interactions. Secondly, we identify two subcategories and highlight their
characteristics and open challenges. We encourage researchers to work together
by demonstrating that different methods can be viewed as diverse solutions to a
common problem and emphasize the importance of including diverse perspectives
and expertise in the field. We believe a deeper understanding of human
communication is crucial to developing machines that can accurately use natural
language in human-machine interactions.

functioning well. Unfortunately, current methods require too much user
involvement and fail to capture their true preferences. In fact, to avoid the
nuisance of manually setting preferences, users usually accept the default
settings even if these do not conform to their true preferences. Norms can be
useful to regulate behaviour and ensure it adheres to user preferences but,
while the literature has thoroughly studied norms, most proposals take a formal
perspective. Indeed, while there has been some research on constructing norms
to capture a user's privacy preferences, these methods rely on domain knowledge
which, in the case of AI technologies, is difficult to obtain and maintain. We
argue that a new perspective is required when constructing norms, which is to
exploit the large amount of preference information readily available from whole
systems of users. Inspired by recommender systems, we believe that
collaborative filtering can offer a suitable approach to identifying a user's
norm preferences without excessive user involvement.

<p class="mathjax">Data cohesion, a recently introduced measure inspired by social interactions,
uses distance comparisons to assess relative proximity. In this work, we
provide a collection of results which can guide the development of
cohesion-based methods in exploratory data analysis and human-aided
computation. Here, we observe the important role of highly clustered
"point-like" sets and the ways in which cohesion allows such sets to take on
qualities of a single weighted point. In doing so, we see how cohesion
complements metric-adjacent measures of dissimilarity and responds to local
density. We conclude by proving that cohesion is the unique function with (i)
average value equal to one-half and (ii) the property that the influence of an
outlier is proportional to its mass. Properties of cohesion are illustrated
with examples throughout.

<p class="mathjax">Airport service quality evaluation is commonly found on social media,
including Google Maps. This valuable for airport management in order to enhance
the quality of services provided. However; prior studies either provide general
review for topics discussed by travellers or provide sentimental value to tag
the entire review without specifically mentioning the airport service that is
behind such value. Accordingly, this work proposes using aspect based
sentimental analysis in order to provide more detailed analysis for travellers
reviews. This works applied aspect based sentimental analysis on data collected
from Google Map about Dubai and Doha airports. The results provide tangible
reasons to use aspect based sentimental analysis in order to understand more
the travellers and spot airport services that are in need for improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Owing to the unrestricted nature of the content in the training data, large
text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), are capable of
generating images with potentially copyrighted or dangerous content based on
corresponding textual concepts information. This includes specific intellectual
property (IP), human faces, and various artistic styles. However, Negative
Prompt, a widely used method for content removal, frequently fails to conceal
this content due to inherent limitations in its inference logic. In this work,
we propose a novel strategy named \textbf{Degeneration-Tuning (DT)} to shield
contents of unwanted concepts from SD weights. By utilizing Scrambled Grid to
reconstruct the correlation between undesired concepts and their corresponding
image domain, we guide SD to generate meaningless content when such textual
concepts are provided as input. As this adaptation occurs at the level of the
model's weights, the SD, after DT, can be grafted onto other conditional
diffusion frameworks like ControlNet to shield unwanted concepts. In addition
to qualitatively showcasing the effectiveness of our DT method in protecting
various types of concepts, a quantitative comparison of the SD before and after
DT indicates that the DT method does not significantly impact the generative
quality of other contents. The FID and IS scores of the model on COCO-30K
exhibit only minor changes after DT, shifting from 12.61 and 39.20 to 13.04 and
38.25, respectively, which clearly outperforms the previous methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are state-of-the-art techniques for solving most
computer vision problems. DNNs require billions of parameters and operations to
achieve state-of-the-art results. This requirement makes DNNs extremely
compute, memory, and energy-hungry, and consequently difficult to deploy on
small battery-powered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices with limited computing
resources. Deployment of DNNs on Internet-of-Things devices, such as traffic
cameras, can improve public safety by enabling applications such as automatic
accident detection and emergency response.Through this paper, we survey the
recent advances in low-power and energy-efficient DNN implementations that
improve the deployability of DNNs without significantly sacrificing accuracy.
In general, these techniques either reduce the memory requirements, the number
of arithmetic operations, or both. The techniques can be divided into three
major categories: neural network compression, network architecture search and
design, and compiler and graph optimizations. In this paper, we survey both
low-power techniques for both convolutional and transformer DNNs, and summarize
the advantages, disadvantages, and open research problems.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperproperties extend trace properties to express properties of sets of
traces, and they are increasingly popular in specifying various security and
performance-related properties in domains such as cyber-physical systems, smart
grids, and automotive. This paper introduces a model checking algorithm for a
new formalism, HyperTWTL, which extends Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL) -- a
domain-specific formal specification language for robotics, by allowing
explicit and simultaneous quantification over multiple execution traces. We
present HyperTWTL with both \emph{synchronous} and \emph{asynchronous}
semantics, based on the alignment of the timestamps in the traces.
Consequently, we demonstrate the application of HyperTWTL in formalizing
important information-flow security policies and concurrency for robotics
applications. Finally, we propose a model checking algorithm for verifying
fragments of HyperTWTL by reducing the problem to a TWTL model checking
problem.

<p class="mathjax">Personalized review-based rating prediction aims at leveraging existing
reviews to model user interests and item characteristics for rating prediction.
Most of the existing studies mainly encounter two issues. First, the rich
knowledge contained in the fine-grained aspects of each review and the
knowledge graph is rarely considered to complement the pure text for better
modeling user-item interactions. Second, the power of pre-trained language
models is not carefully studied for personalized review-based rating
prediction. To address these issues, we propose an approach named
Knowledge-aware Collaborative Filtering with Pre-trained Language Model
(KCF-PLM). For the first issue, to utilize rich knowledge, KCF-PLM develops a
transformer network to model the interactions of the extracted aspects w.r.t. a
user-item pair. For the second issue, to better represent users and items,
KCF-PLM takes all the historical reviews of a user or an item as input to
pre-trained language models. Moreover, KCF-PLM integrates the transformer
network and the pre-trained language models through representation propagation
on the knowledge graph and user-item guided attention of the aspect
representations. Thus KCF-PLM combines review text, aspect, knowledge graph,
and pre-trained language models together for review-based rating prediction. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on several public datasets, demonstrating the
effectiveness of KCF-PLM.

<p class="mathjax">By integrating the self-attention capability and the biological properties of
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Spikformer applies the flourishing Transformer
architecture to SNN design. It introduces a Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) module
to mix sparse visual features using spike-form Query, Key, and Value, resulting
in State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance on numerous datasets compared to
previous SNN-like frameworks. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Spikformer
architecture can be accelerated by replacing the SSA with an unparameterized
Linear Transform (LT) such as Fourier and Wavelet transforms. These transforms
are utilized to mix spike sequences, reducing the quadratic time complexity to
log-linear time complexity. They alternate between the frequency and time
domains to extract sparse visual features, showcasing powerful performance and
efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification using both
neuromorphic and static datasets. The results indicate that compared to the
SOTA Spikformer with SSA, Spikformer with LT achieves higher Top-1 accuracy on
neuromorphic datasets and comparable Top-1 accuracy on static datasets.
Moreover, Spikformer with LT achieves approximately $29$-$51\%$ improvement in
training speed, $61$-$70\%$ improvement in inference speed, and reduces memory
usage by $4$-$26\%$ due to not requiring learnable parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Deep generative models can generate high-fidelity audio conditioned on
various types of representations (e.g., mel-spectrograms, Mel-frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)). Recently, such models have been used to
synthesize audio waveforms conditioned on highly compressed representations.
Although such methods produce impressive results, they are prone to generate
audible artifacts when the conditioning is flawed or imperfect. An alternative
modeling approach is to use diffusion models. However, these have mainly been
used as speech vocoders (i.e., conditioned on mel-spectrograms) or generating
relatively low sampling rate signals. In this work, we propose a high-fidelity
multi-band diffusion-based framework that generates any type of audio modality
(e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds) from low-bitrate discrete
representations. At equal bit rate, the proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art generative techniques in terms of perceptual quality. Training
and, evaluation code, along with audio samples, are available on the

<p class="mathjax">Food classification is an important task in health care. In this work, we
propose a multimodal classification framework that uses the modified version of
EfficientNet with the Mish activation function for image classification, and
the traditional BERT transformer-based network is used for text classification.
The proposed network and the other state-of-the-art methods are evaluated on a
large open-source dataset, UPMC Food-101. The experimental results show that
the proposed network outperforms the other methods, a significant difference of
11.57% and 6.34% in accuracy is observed for image and text classification,
respectively, when compared with the second-best performing method. We also
compared the performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall for text
classification using both machine learning and deep learning-based models. The
comparative analysis from the prediction results of both images and text
demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">Textual graphs (TGs) are graphs whose nodes correspond to text (sentences or
documents), which are widely prevalent. The representation learning of TGs
involves two stages: (i) unsupervised feature extraction and (ii) supervised
graph representation learning. In recent years, extensive efforts have been
devoted to the latter stage, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have dominated.
However, the former stage for most existing graph benchmarks still relies on
traditional feature engineering techniques. More recently, with the rapid
development of language models (LMs), researchers have focused on leveraging
LMs to facilitate the learning of TGs, either by jointly training them in a
computationally intensive framework (merging the two stages), or designing
complex self-supervised training tasks for feature extraction (enhancing the
first stage). In this work, we present SimTeG, a frustratingly Simple approach
for Textual Graph learning that does not innovate in frameworks, models, and
tasks. Instead, we first perform supervised parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) on a pre-trained LM on the downstream task, such as node classification.
We then generate node embeddings using the last hidden states of finetuned LM.
These derived features can be further utilized by any GNN for training on the
same task. We evaluate our approach on two fundamental graph representation
learning tasks: node classification and link prediction. Through extensive
experiments, we show that our approach significantly improves the performance
of various GNNs on multiple graph benchmarks.

for the ACM RecSys Challenge 2023. The competition was organized by ShareChat,
and involved predicting the probability of a user clicking an app ad and/or
installing an app, to improve deep funnel optimization and a special focus on
user privacy. Our proposed method inferring the probabilities of clicking and
installing as two different, but related tasks. Hence, the model engineers a
specific set of features for each task and a set of shared features. Our model
is called Weighted Multi-Level Feature Factorization because it considers the
interaction of different order features, where the order is associated to the
depth in a neural network. The prediction for a given task is generated by
combining the task specific and shared features on the different levels. Our

<p class="mathjax">The challenge posed by multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) is mainly
two-fold: (1) bridging the semantic gap between text and image and (2) matching
the entity with its associated object in image. Existing methods fail to
capture the implicit entity-object relations, due to the lack of corresponding
annotation. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional generative alignment
method named BGA-MNER to tackle these issues. Our BGA-MNER consists of
\texttt{image2text} and \texttt{text2image} generation with respect to
entity-salient content in two modalities. It jointly optimizes the
bidirectional reconstruction objectives, leading to aligning the implicit
entity-object relations under such direct and powerful constraints.
Furthermore, image-text pairs usually contain unmatched components which are
noisy for generation. A stage-refined context sampler is proposed to extract
the matched cross-modal content for generation. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
without image input during inference.

<p class="mathjax">Adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction plays a crucial role in both health
care and drug discovery for reducing patient mortality and enhancing drug
safety. Recently, many studies have been devoted to effectively predict the
drug-ADRs incidence rates. However, these methods either did not effectively
utilize non-clinical data, i.e., physical, chemical, and biological information
about the drug, or did little to establish a link between content-based and
pure collaborative filtering during the training phase. In this paper, we first
formulate the prediction of multi-label ADRs as a drug-ADR collaborative
filtering problem, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
provide extensive benchmark results of previous collaborative filtering methods
on two large publicly available clinical datasets. Then, by exploiting the easy
accessible drug characteristics from non-clinical data, we propose ADRNet, a
generalized collaborative filtering framework combining clinical and
non-clinical data for drug-ADR prediction. Specifically, ADRNet has a shallow
collaborative filtering module and a deep drug representation module, which can
exploit the high-dimensional drug descriptors to further guide the learning of
low-dimensional ADR latent embeddings, which incorporates both the benefits of
collaborative filtering and representation learning. Extensive experiments are
conducted on two publicly available real-world drug-ADR clinical datasets and
two non-clinical datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the
proposed ADRNet. The code is available at
https://github.com/haoxuanli-pku/ADRnet.

<p class="mathjax">Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times,
especially to move freight and public transportation from road traffic and
planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global
railway network is time and resource consuming, maximizing the rail capacity on
the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains
is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must
be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the
distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling
systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications
provided by the ETCS Hybrid Level 3 (since recently also known as ETCS Level 2
with Hybrid Train Detection) allow the usage of virtual subsections. This
additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and,
thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design
tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern
railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design
problems arising within ETCS Hybrid Level 3, neither formal descriptions nor
results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks
exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of
design tasks for the Hybrid Level 3 of the European Train Control System and
proofs that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we
are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve
those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit
available at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.

<p class="mathjax">Privacy is an increasingly feeble constituent of the present datafied world
and apparently the reason for that is clear: powerful actors worked to invade
everyone's privacy for commercial and surveillance purposes. The existence of
those actors and their agendas is undeniable, but the explanation is overly
simplistic and contributed to create a narrative that tends to preserve the
status quo. In this essay, I analyze several facets of the lack of online
privacy and idiosyncrasies exhibited by privacy advocates, together with
characteristics of the industry mostly responsible for the datafication process
and why its asserted high effectiveness should be openly inquired. Then I
discuss of possible effects of datafication on human behavior, the prevalent
market-oriented assumption at the base of online privacy, and some emerging
adaptation strategies. In the last part, the regulatory approach to online
privacy is considered. The EU's GDPR is praised as the reference case of modern
privacy regulations, but the same success hinders critical aspects that also
emerged, from the quirks of the institutional decision process, to the flaws of
the informed consent principle. A glimpse on the likely problematic future is
provided with a discussion on privacy related aspects of EU, UK, and China's
proposed generative AI policies.

OpenAI's GPT-4, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence language model,
across multiple iterations, time spans and stylistic variations. The model
rated responses to tasks within the Higher Education (HE) subject domain of
macroeconomics in terms of their content and style. Statistical analysis was
conducted in order to learn more about the interrater reliability, consistency
of the ratings across iterations and the correlation between ratings in terms
of content and style. The results revealed a high interrater reliability with
ICC scores ranging between 0.94 and 0.99 for different timespans, suggesting
that GPT-4 is capable of generating consistent ratings across repetitions with
a clear prompt. Style and content ratings show a high correlation of 0.87. When
applying a non-adequate style the average content ratings remained constant,
while style ratings decreased, which indicates that the large language model
(LLM) effectively distinguishes between these two criteria during evaluation.
The prompt used in this study is furthermore presented and explained. Further
research is necessary to assess the robustness and reliability of AI models in
various use cases.

<p class="mathjax">Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is an essential task in recommendation
systems, where accurately predicting unknown QoS values can improve user
satisfaction. However, existing QoS prediction techniques may perform poorly in
the presence of noise data, such as fake location information or virtual
gateways. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Deep Supervision Network
(PDS-Net), a novel framework for QoS prediction that addresses this issue.
PDS-Net utilizes a Gaussian-based probabilistic space to supervise intermediate
layers and learns probability spaces for both known features and true labels.
Moreover, PDS-Net employs a condition-based multitasking loss function to
identify objects with noise data and applies supervision directly to deep
features sampled from the probability space by optimizing the Kullback-Leibler
distance between the probability space of these objects and the real-label
probability space. Thus, PDS-Net effectively reduces errors resulting from the
propagation of corrupted data, leading to more accurate QoS predictions.
Experimental evaluations on two real-world QoS datasets demonstrate that the
proposed PDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for detecting the
exploitation of vulnerabilities in the wild by monitoring underground hacking
forums. The increasing volume of posts discussing exploitation in the wild
calls for an automatic approach to process threads and posts that will
eventually trigger alarms depending on their content. To illustrate the
proposed system, we use the CrimeBB dataset, which contains data scraped from
multiple underground forums, and develop a supervised machine learning model
that can filter threads citing CVEs and label them as Proof-of-Concept,
Weaponization, or Exploitation. Leveraging random forests, we indicate that
accuracy, precision and recall above 0.99 are attainable for the classification
task. Additionally, we provide insights into the difference in nature between
weaponization and exploitation, e.g., interpreting the output of a decision
tree, and analyze the profits and other aspects related to the hacking
communities. Overall, our work sheds insight into the exploitation of
vulnerabilities in the wild and can be used to provide additional ground truth
to models such as EPSS and Expected Exploitability.

training set to synthesize a run-time prompt for each Natural Language (NL)
test query. In contrast, we devise an algorithm which performs offline sampling
of a minimal set-of few-shots from the training data, with complete coverage of
SQL clauses, operators and functions, and maximal domain coverage within the
allowed token length. This allows for synthesis of a fixed Generic Prompt (GP),
with a diverse set-of exemplars common across NL test queries, avoiding
expensive test time exemplar retrieval. We further auto-adapt the GP to the
target database domain (DA-GP), to better handle cross-domain generalization;
followed by a decomposed Least-To-Most-Prompting (LTMP-DA-GP) to handle
cross-compositional generalization. The synthesis of LTMP-DA-GP is an offline
task, to be performed one-time per new database with minimal human
intervention. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the KaggleDBQA
dataset, designed to evaluate generalizability for the Text-to-SQL task. We
further showcase consistent performance improvement of LTMP-DA-GP over GP,
across LLMs and databases of KaggleDBQA, highlighting the efficacy and model
agnostic benefits of our prompt based adapt and decompose approach.

<p class="mathjax">In reinforcement learning (RL), a reward function is often assumed at the
outset of a policy optimization procedure. Learning in such a fixed reward
paradigm in RL can neglect important policy optimization considerations, such
as state space coverage and safety. Moreover, it can fail to encompass broader
impacts in terms of social welfare, sustainability, or market stability,
potentially leading to undesirable emergent behavior and potentially misaligned
policy. To mathematically encapsulate the problem of aligning RL policy
optimization with such externalities, we consider a bilevel optimization
problem and connect it to a principal-agent framework, where the principal
specifies the broader goals and constraints of the system at the upper level
and the agent solves a Markov Decision Process (MDP) at the lower level. The
upper-level deals with learning a suitable reward parametrization corresponding
to the broader goals and the lower-level deals with learning the policy for the
agent. We propose Principal driven Policy Alignment via Bilevel RL (PPA-BRL),
which efficiently aligns the policy of the agent with the principal's goals. We
explicitly analyzed the dependence of the principal's trajectory on the
lower-level policy, prove the convergence of PPA-BRL to the stationary point of
the problem. We illuminate the merits of this framework in view of alignment
with several examples spanning energy-efficient manipulation tasks, social
welfare-based tax design, and cost-effective robotic navigation.

<p class="mathjax">The use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is ubiquitous in
a number of businesses and sectors, including retail sales, smart cities,
agriculture, and transportation. Additionally, educational institutions have
started using RFID to track student attendance, combining this technology with
Google Sheets and the Internet of Things (IoT) to build a real-time attendance
tracking system. For a thorough examination of the creation of a student
attendance system, this paper includes a systematic literature evaluation of 21
major research published on IoT based attendance systems employing RFID. This
RFID-based attendance system enables automation, eliminating several problems
connected with the manual process, such as time wasting, proxies, and the
possibility of losing the attendance sheet, in contrast to the traditional
attendance system, which depends on manual signatures. By creating a system
that automatically registers students' attendance by merely flashing their
student cards at the RFID reader, all the aforementioned difficulties may be
successfully addressed. This automated method guarantees attendance monitoring
accuracy and dependability while also saving time. This paper's conclusion
highlights the significant advantages of implementing an IoT-based attendance
system based on RFID technology. The suggested solution provides a trustworthy,
efficient, and secure alternative to manual attendance techniques, successfully
addressing their shortcomings. This paper offers helpful insights for
institutions looking to create a cutting-edge attendance system that increases
student involvement and academic achievement by looking at guiding principles,
best practices, and the successful resolution of difficulties.

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) are increasingly being used in
safety-critical systems. Ensuring the safety of DRL agents is a critical
concern in such contexts. However, relying solely on testing is not sufficient
to ensure safety as it does not offer guarantees. Building safety monitors is
one solution to alleviate this challenge. This paper proposes SMARLA, a machine
learning-based safety monitoring approach designed for DRL agents. For
practical reasons, SMARLA is designed to be black-box (as it does not require
access to the internals of the agent) and leverages state abstraction to reduce
the state space and thus facilitate the learning of safety violation prediction
models from agent's states. We validated SMARLA on two well-known RL case
studies. Empirical analysis reveals that SMARLA achieves accurate violation
prediction with a low false positive rate, and can predict safety violations at
an early stage, approximately halfway through the agent's execution before
violations occur.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Branched Latent Neural Operators (BLNOs) to learn input-output
maps encoding complex physical processes. A BLNO is defined by a simple and
compact feedforward partially-connected neural network that structurally
disentangles inputs with different intrinsic roles, such as the time variable
from model parameters of a differential equation, while transferring them into
a generic field of interest. BLNOs leverage interpretable latent outputs to
enhance the learned dynamics and break the curse of dimensionality by showing
excellent generalization properties with small training datasets and short
training times on a single processor. Indeed, their generalization error
remains comparable regardless of the adopted discretization during the testing
phase. Moreover, the partial connections, in place of a fully-connected
structure, significantly reduce the number of tunable parameters. We show the
capabilities of BLNOs in a challenging test case involving biophysically
detailed electrophysiology simulations in a biventricular cardiac model of a
pediatric patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The model includes a
purkinje network for fast conduction and a heart-torso geometry. Specifically,
we trained BLNOs on 150 in silico generated 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs)
while spanning 7 model parameters, covering cell-scale, organ-level and
electrical dyssynchrony. Although the 12-lead ECGs manifest very fast dynamics
with sharp gradients, after automatic hyperparameter tuning the optimal BLNO,
trained in less than 3 hours on a single CPU, retains just 7 hidden layers and
19 neurons per layer. The mean square error is on the order of $10^{-4}$ on an
independent test dataset comprised of 50 additional electrophysiology
simulations. This paper provides a novel computational tool to build reliable
and efficient reduced-order models for digital twinning in engineering
applications.

<p class="mathjax">By offloading computation-intensive tasks of vehicles to roadside units
(RSUs), mobile edge computing (MEC) in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can
relieve the onboard computation burden. However, existing model-based task
offloading methods suffer from heavy computational complexity with the increase
of vehicles and data-driven methods lack interpretability. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we propose a knowledge-driven multi-agent
reinforcement learning (KMARL) approach to reduce the latency of task
offloading in cybertwin-enabled IoV. Specifically, in the considered scenario,
the cybertwin serves as a communication agent for each vehicle to exchange
information and make offloading decisions in the virtual space. To reduce the
latency of task offloading, a KMARL approach is proposed to select the optimal
offloading option for each vehicle, where graph neural networks are employed by
leveraging domain knowledge concerning graph-structure communication topology
and permutation invariance into neural networks. Numerical results show that
our proposed KMARL yields higher rewards and demonstrates improved scalability
compared with other methods, benefitting from the integration of domain
knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to understand the interactions
between humans and objects, which plays a curtail role in high-level semantic
understanding tasks. However, most works pursue designing better architectures
to learn overall features more efficiently, while ignoring the long-tail nature
of interaction-object pair categories. In this paper, we propose to alleviate
the impact of such an unbalanced distribution via Virtual Image Leaning (VIL).
Firstly, a novel label-to-image approach, Multiple Steps Image Creation
(MUSIC), is proposed to create a high-quality dataset that has a consistent
distribution with real images. In this stage, virtual images are generated
based on prompts with specific characterizations and selected by
multi-filtering processes. Secondly, we use both virtual and real images to
train the model with the teacher-student framework. Considering the initial
labels of some virtual images are inaccurate and inadequate, we devise an
Adaptive Matching-and-Filtering (AMF) module to construct pseudo-labels. Our
method is independent of the internal structure of HOI detectors, so it can be
combined with off-the-shelf methods by training merely 10 additional epochs.
With the assistance of our method, multiple methods obtain significant
improvements, and new state-of-the-art results are achieved on two benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">To reason about where responsibility does and should lie in complex
situations involving AI-enabled systems, we first need a sufficiently clear and
detailed cross-disciplinary vocabulary for talking about responsibility.
Responsibility is a triadic relation involving an actor, an occurrence, and a
way of being responsible. As part of a conscious effort towards 'unravelling'
the concept of responsibility to support practical reasoning about
responsibility for AI, this paper takes the three-part formulation, 'Actor A is
responsible for Occurrence O' and identifies valid combinations of
subcategories of A, is responsible for, and O. These valid combinations - which
we term "responsibility strings" - are grouped into four senses of
responsibility: role-responsibility; causal responsibility; legal
liability-responsibility; and moral responsibility. They are illustrated with
two running examples, one involving a healthcare AI-based system and another
the fatal collision of an AV with a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona in 2018. The
output of the paper is 81 responsibility strings. The aim is that these strings
provide the vocabulary for people across disciplines to be clear and specific
about the different ways that different actors are responsible for different
occurrences within a complex event for which responsibility is sought, allowing
for precise and targeted interdisciplinary normative deliberations.

<p class="mathjax">There is a great opportunity to use high-quality patient journals and health
registers to develop machine learning-based Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS). To implement a CDSS tool in a clinical workflow, there is a need to
integrate, validate and test this tool on the Electronic Health Record (EHR)
systems used to store and manage patient data. However, it is often not
possible to get the necessary access to an EHR system due to legal compliance.
We propose an architecture for generating and using synthetic EHR data for CDSS
tool development. The architecture is implemented in a system called SyntHIR.
The SyntHIR system uses the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
standards for data interoperability, the Gretel framework for generating
synthetic data, the Microsoft Azure FHIR server as the FHIR-based EHR system
and SMART on FHIR framework for tool transportability. We demonstrate the
usefulness of SyntHIR by developing a machine learning-based CDSS tool using
data from the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR) and Norwegian Patient
Prescriptions (NorPD). We demonstrate the development of the tool on the
SyntHIR system and then lift it to the Open DIPS environment. In conclusion,
SyntHIR provides a generic architecture for CDSS tool development using
synthetic FHIR data and a testing environment before implementing it in a
clinical setting. However, there is scope for improvement in terms of the
quality of the synthetic data generated. The code is open source and available
at https://github.com/potter-coder89/SyntHIR.git.

vehicles on the roads, managing transportation efficiently and ensuring safety
have become critical challenges. To tackle these issues, the development of
intelligent control systems for vehicles is paramount. This paper presents a
comprehensive study on vehicle control for collision avoidance, leveraging the
power of Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) techniques. Our main goal
is to minimize travel delays and enhance the average speed of vehicles while
prioritizing safety and preserving data privacy. To accomplish this, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the local model, Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG), and the global model, Federated Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (FDDPG), to determine their effectiveness in optimizing vehicle
control for collision avoidance. The results obtained indicate that the FDDPG
algorithm outperforms DDPG in terms of effectively controlling vehicles and
preventing collisions. Significantly, the FDDPG-based algorithm demonstrates
substantial reductions in travel delays and notable improvements in average
speed compared to the DDPG algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Shared automated mobility-on-demand promises efficient, sustainable, and
flexible transportation. Nevertheless, security concerns, resilience, and their
mutual influence - especially at night - will likely be the most critical
barriers to public adoption since passengers have to share rides with strangers
without a human driver on board. As related work points out that information
about fellow travelers might mitigate passengers' concerns, we designed two
user interface variants to investigate the role of this information in an
exploratory within-subjects user study (N = 24). Participants experienced four
automated day and night rides with varying personal information about
co-passengers in a simulated environment. The results of the mixed-method study
indicate that having information about other passengers (e.g., photo, gender,
and name) positively affects user experience at night. In contrast, it is less
necessary during the day. Considering participants' simultaneously raised
privacy demands poses a substantial challenge for resilient system design.

multiple-choice questions (MCQ) correctly. Next, we task the LLM with
information extractions from a filtered GTFS feed with 4 routes. For
information retrieval, we compare zero-shot and program synthesis. Program
synthesis works better, achieving ~90% accuracy on simple questions and ~40%
accuracy on complex questions.

<p class="mathjax">Robots in 3D spaces with more than six degrees of freedom are redundant. A
redundant robot allows multiple configurations of the robot for the given
target point in the dexterous workspace. The presence of multiple solutions
helps in resolving constraints in workspace such as object avoidance and energy
minimization during trajectory planning. Inverse kinematics solutions of such
redundant robotics are intricate. The present study involves comparison of
different metaheuristic optimization algorithms (MOA), which have a positional
error, and identify a MOA for high precision of positioning of the end effector
of the robot. This study applies recent MOA for the inverse kinematics of hyper
redundant nine degrees of freedom (DOF) robot arm by using forward kinematics
of the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters and compares the performance of these
algorithms. The comparative study shows Bald Eagle Search (BES) algorithm has
better performance over other metaheuristic algorithms. BES algorithm
outperforms the other MOA in achieving the desired position with very high
precision and least positional error for a 9-DOF robot arm.

<p class="mathjax">To improve the accuracy of color image completion with missing entries, we
present a recovery method based on generalized higher-order scalars. We extend
the traditional second-order matrix model to a more comprehensive higher-order
matrix equivalent, called the "t-matrix" model, which incorporates a pixel
neighborhood expansion strategy to characterize the local pixel constraints.
This "t-matrix" model is then used to extend some commonly used matrix and
tensor completion algorithms to their higher-order versions. We perform
extensive experiments on various algorithms using simulated data and algorithms
on simulated data and publicly available images and compare their performance.
The results show that our generalized matrix completion model and the
corresponding algorithm compare favorably with their lower-order tensor and
conventional matrix counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were introduced by the United
Nations in order to encourage policies and activities that help guarantee human
prosperity and sustainability. SDG frameworks produced in the finance industry
are designed to provide scores that indicate how well a company aligns with
each of the 17 SDGs. This scoring enables a consistent assessment of
investments that have the potential of building an inclusive and sustainable
economy. As a result of the high quality and reliability required by such
frameworks, the process of creating and maintaining them is time-consuming and
requires extensive domain expertise. In this work, we describe a data-driven
system that seeks to automate the process of creating an SDG framework. First,
we propose a novel method for collecting and filtering a dataset of texts from
different web sources and a knowledge graph relevant to a set of companies. We
then implement and deploy classifiers trained with this data for predicting
scores of alignment with SDGs for a given company. Our results indicate that
our best performing model can accurately predict SDG scores with a micro
average F1 score of 0.89, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
solution. We further describe how the integration of the models for its use by
humans can be facilitated by providing explanations in the form of data
relevant to a predicted score. We find that our proposed solution enables
access to a large amount of information that analysts would normally not be
able to process, resulting in an accurate prediction of SDG scores at a
fraction of the cost.

<p class="mathjax">Is artificial intelligence (AI) disrupting jobs and creating unemployment?
Despite many attempts to quantify occupations' exposure to AI, inconsistent
validation obfuscates the relative benefits of each approach. A lack of
disaggregated labor outcome data, including unemployment data, further
exacerbates the issue. Here, we assess which models of AI exposure predict job
separations and unemployment risk using new occupation-level unemployment data
by occupation from each US state's unemployment insurance office spanning 2010
through 2020. Although these AI exposure scores have been used by governments
and industry, we find that individual AI exposure models are not predictive of
unemployment rates, unemployment risk, or job separation rates. However, an
ensemble of those models exhibits substantial predictive power suggesting that
competing models may capture different aspects of AI exposure that collectively
account for AI's variable impact across occupations, regions, and time. Our
results also call for dynamic, context-aware, and validated methods for
assessing AI exposure. Interactive visualizations for this study are available

This allows to construct reduced-order models in the form of Hamiltonian

constructed reduced-order models preserve global energy, and the spatially

<p class="mathjax">The main approaches for simulating FMCW radar are based on ray tracing, which
is usually computationally intensive and do not account for background noise.
This work proposes a faster method for FMCW radar simulation capable of
generating synthetic raw radar data using generative adversarial networks
(GAN). The code and pre-trained weights are open-source and available on
GitHub. This method generates 16 simultaneous chirps, which allows the
generated data to be used for the further development of algorithms for
processing radar data (filtering and clustering). This can increase the
potential for data augmentation, e.g., by generating data in non-existent or
safety-critical scenarios that are not reproducible in real life. In this work,
the GAN was trained with radar measurements of a motorcycle and used to
generate synthetic raw radar data of a motorcycle traveling in a straight line.
For generating this data, the distance of the motorcycle and Gaussian noise are
used as input to the neural network. The synthetic generated radar chirps were
evaluated using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Then, the Range-Azimuth
(RA) map is calculated twice: (1\textsuperscript{st}) based on synthetic data
using this GAN and (2\textsuperscript{nd}) based on real data. Based on these
RA maps, an algorithm with adaptive threshold and edge detection is used for
object detection. The results have shown that the data is realistic in terms of
coherent radar reflections of the motorcycle and background noise based on the
comparison of chirps, the RA maps and the object detection results. Thus, the
proposed method in this work has shown to minimize the simulation-to-reality
gap for the generation of radar data.

<p class="mathjax">As mobile and smart connectivity continue to grow, malware presents a
permanently evolving threat to different types of critical domains such as
health, logistics, banking, and community segments. Different types of malware
have dynamic behaviors and complicated characteristics that are shared among
members of the same malware family. Malware threat intelligence reports play a
crucial role in describing and documenting the detected malware, providing a
wealth of information regarding its attributes, patterns, and behaviors. There
is a large amount of intelligent threat information regarding malware. The
ontology allows the systematic organization and categorization of this
information to ensure consistency in representing concepts and entities across
various sources. In this study, we reviewed and extended an existing malware
ontology to cover Android malware. Our extended ontology is called AndMalOnt.
It consisted of 13 new classes, 16 object properties, and 31 data properties.
Second, we created an Android malware knowledge graph by extracting reports
from the MalwareBazaar repository and representing them in AndMalOnt. This
involved generating a knowledge graph that encompasses over 2600 malware
samples. Our ontology, knowledge graph, and source code are all open-source and

<p class="mathjax">The open radio access network (O-RAN), with its disaggregated and open
architecture, is poised to meet the demands of the next generation of wireless
communication. However, to unlock the full potentials of O-RAN, real-time
network modeling and optimization are essential. A promising solution for such
requirement is the use of network digital twin (NDT). NDT provides a
comprehensive view of a network, covering both physical and logical components,
including infrastructure, protocols, and algorithms. NDT, as a real-time
virtual representation of O-RAN facilitates a variety of operations, such as
emulations, test, optimization, monitoring, and analysis of a new configuration
in a risk-free environment, without requiring them to be implemented in real
network. Such capability enables the vendors and network operators for a faster
adoption of new solutions with frequent updates, while ensuring the resiliency
of the existing services via planning ahead under various "what-if" scenarios.
In this paper, we first describe what exactly NDT means in the context of
O-RAN, as well as its key enablers. We then describe the NDT application within
the O-RAN in both prior and post-deployment. Finally, we provide two practical
uses cases, namely network energy efficiency and traffic steering, where the
NDT can be leveraged effectively.

<p class="mathjax">Privacy has rapidly become a major concern/design consideration. Homomorphic
Encryption (HE) and Garbled Circuits (GC) are privacy-preserving techniques
that support computations on encrypted data. HE and GC can complement each
other, as HE is more efficient for linear operations, while GC is more
effective for non-linear operations. Together, they enable complex computing
tasks, such as machine learning, to be performed exactly on ciphertexts.
However, HE and GC introduce two major bottlenecks: an elevated computational
overhead and high data transfer costs. This paper presents PPIMCE, an in-memory
computing (IMC) fabric designed to mitigate both computational overhead and
data transfer issues. Through the use of multiple IMC cores for high
parallelism, and by leveraging in-SRAM IMC for data management, PPIMCE offers a
compact, energy-efficient solution for accelerating HE and GC. PPIMCE achieves
a 107X speedup against a CPU implementation of GC. Additionally, PPIMCE
achieves a 1,500X and 800X speedup compared to CPU and GPU implementations of
CKKS-based HE multiplications. For privacy-preserving machine learning
inference, PPIMCE attains a 1,000X speedup compared to CPU and a 12X speedup
against CraterLake, the state-of-art privacy preserving computation
accelerator.

<p class="mathjax">The single-source unsplittable flow (SSUF) problem asks to send flow from a
common source to different terminals with unrelated demands, each terminal
being served through a single path. One of the most heavily studied SSUF
objectives is to minimize the violation of some given arc capacities. A seminal
result of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans showed that, whenever a fractional flow
exists respecting the capacities, then there is an unsplittable one violating
the capacities by at most the maximum demand. Goemans conjectured a very
natural cost version of the same result, where the unsplittable flow is
required to be no more expensive than the fractional one. This intriguing
conjecture remains open. More so, there are arguably no non-trivial graph
classes for which it is known to hold.
<br />We show that a slight weakening of it (with at most twice as large
violations) holds for planar graphs. Our result is based on a connection to a
highly structured discrepancy problem, whose repeated resolution allows us to
successively reduce the number of paths used for each terminal, until we obtain
an unsplittable flow. Moreover, our techniques also extend to simultaneous
upper and lower bounds on the flow values. This also affirmatively answers a
conjecture of Morell and Skutella for planar SSUF.

<p class="mathjax">A new crypto token is proposed as an incentive mechanism to remove CO2 from
the atmosphere permanently at gigaton scale. The token facilitates CO2 removal
(CDR) by providing financial incentives to those that are removing CO2 and an
opportunity to provide additional financial resources for CDR by the public.
The new token will be native to a blockchain that uses a Proof-of-Useful-Work
(PoUW) consensus mechanism. The useful work will be conducted by direct air
carbon capture and storage (DACCS) facilities that will compete with each other
based on the amount of CO2 captured and permanently stored. In terms of energy
consumption, we require that the entire process, comprising DACCS technology
and all blockchain operations, be climate positive while accounting for life
cycle analysis of equipment used. We describe the underlying reward mechanism
coupled with a verification mechanism for CDR. In addition, we consider
security features to limit attacks and fraudulent activity. Finally, we outline
a roadmap of features that are necessary to fully implement and deploy such a
system, but are beyond the current scope of this article.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new tensor integration method for time-dependent PDEs that
controls the tensor rank of the PDE solution via time-dependent diffeomorphic
coordinate transformations. Such coordinate transformations are generated by
minimizing the normal component of the PDE operator relative to the tensor
manifold that approximates the PDE solution via a convex functional. The
proposed method significantly improves upon and may be used in conjunction with
the coordinate-adaptive algorithm we recently proposed in JCP (2023) Vol. 491,
112378, which is based on non-convex relaxations of the rank minimization
problem and Riemannian optimization. Numerical applications demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed coordinate-adaptive tensor integration method are
presented and discussed for prototype Liouville and Fokker-Planck equations.

<p class="mathjax">Two Boolean functions f, g : F_2^{n} \to {-1, 1} are called linearly
isomorphic if there exists an invertible matrix M \in F_2^{n\times n} such that
f\circ M = g. Testing linear isomorphism is a generalization of, now classical
in the context of property testing, isomorphism testing between Boolean
functions. Linear-invariance of Boolean functions has also been extensively
studied in other areas like coding theory and cryptography, and mathematics in
general. In this paper, we will study the following two variants of this
problem:
<br />[1] [Communication complexity: ] Assume that Boolean functions f and g on
F_2^{n} are given to Alice and Bob respectively, and the goal is to test linear
isomorphism between f and g by exchanging a minimum amount of communication,
measured in bits, between Alice and Bob. Our main result is an efficient
two-party communication protocol for testing linear isomorphism in terms of the
approximate spectral norm of the functions. We will crucially exploit the
connection between approximate spectral norm and sign-approximating
polynomials.
<br />[2] [Query complexity: ] If f: F_2^{n} \to { -1, 1 } is a known function and
g : F_2^{n} \to { -1, 1 } be an unknown function with a query access. We study
the query complexity of testing linear isomorphism between f and g in terms of
the approximate spectral norm of f. As in the case of communication complexity,
we will use properties of the approximate spectral norm.

the plane, where the edges are polylines with two bends per edge and any pair

<p class="mathjax">Automatically solving puzzle instances in the game The Witness can guide
players toward solutions and help puzzle designers generate better puzzles. In
the latter case such an Artificial Intelligence puzzle solver can inform a
human puzzle designer and procedural puzzle generator to produce better
instances. The puzzles, however, are combinatorially difficult and search-based
solvers can require large amounts of time and memory. We accelerate such search
by automatically learning a human-explainable predicate that predicts whether a
partial path to a Witness-type puzzle is not completable to a solution path. We
prove a key property of the learned predicate which allows us to use it for
pruning successor states in search thereby accelerating search by an average of
six times while maintaining completeness of the underlying search. Conversely
given a fixed search time budget per puzzle our predicate-accelerated search
can solve more puzzle instances of larger sizes than the baseline search.

<p class="mathjax">Although instance segmentation methods have improved considerably, the
dominant paradigm is to rely on fully-annotated training images, which are
tedious to obtain. To alleviate this reliance, and boost results,
semi-supervised approaches leverage unlabeled data as an additional training
signal that limits overfitting to the labeled samples. In this context, we
present novel design choices to significantly improve teacher-student
distillation models. In particular, we (i) improve the distillation approach by
introducing a novel "guided burn-in" stage, and (ii) evaluate different
instance segmentation architectures, as well as backbone networks and
pre-training strategies. Contrary to previous work which uses only supervised
data for the burn-in period of the student model, we also use guidance of the
teacher model to exploit unlabeled data in the burn-in period. Our improved
distillation approach leads to substantial improvements over previous
state-of-the-art results. For example, on the Cityscapes dataset we improve
mask-AP from 23.7 to 33.9 when using labels for 10\% of images, and on the COCO
dataset we improve mask-AP from 18.3 to 34.1 when using labels for only 1\% of
the training data.

<p class="mathjax">Recent text-to-image generative models have enabled us to transform our words
into vibrant, captivating imagery. The surge of personalization techniques that
has followed has also allowed us to imagine unique concepts in new scenes.
However, an intriguing question remains: How can we generate a new, imaginary
concept that has never been seen before? In this paper, we present the task of
creative text-to-image generation, where we seek to generate new members of a
broad category (e.g., generating a pet that differs from all existing pets). We
leverage the under-studied Diffusion Prior models and show that the creative
generation problem can be formulated as an optimization process over the output
space of the diffusion prior, resulting in a set of "prior constraints". To
keep our generated concept from converging into existing members, we
incorporate a question-answering model that adaptively adds new constraints to
the optimization problem, encouraging the model to discover increasingly more
unique creations. Finally, we show that our prior constraints can also serve as
a strong mixing mechanism allowing us to create hybrids between generated
concepts, introducing even more flexibility into the creative process.

<p class="mathjax">Visual-inertial initialization can be classified into joint and disjoint
approaches. Joint approaches tackle both the visual and the inertial parameters
together by aligning observations from feature-bearing points based on IMU
integration then use a closed-form solution with visual and acceleration
observations to find initial velocity and gravity. In contrast, disjoint
approaches independently solve the Structure from Motion (SFM) problem and
determine inertial parameters from up-to-scale camera poses obtained from pure
monocular SLAM. However, previous disjoint methods have limitations, like
assuming negligible acceleration bias impact or accurate rotation estimation by
pure monocular SLAM. To address these issues, we propose EDI, a novel approach
for fast, accurate, and robust visual-inertial initialization. Our method
incorporates an Error-state Kalman Filter (ESKF) to estimate gyroscope bias and
correct rotation estimates from monocular SLAM, overcoming dependence on pure
monocular SLAM for rotation estimation. To estimate the scale factor without
prior information, we offer a closed-form solution for initial velocity, scale,
gravity, and acceleration bias estimation. To address gravity and acceleration
bias coupling, we introduce weights in the linear least-squares equations,
ensuring acceleration bias observability and handling outliers. Extensive
evaluation on the EuRoC dataset shows that our method achieves an average scale
error of 5.8% in less than 3 seconds, outperforming other state-of-the-art
disjoint visual-inertial initialization approaches, even in challenging
environments and with artificial noise corruption.

<p class="mathjax">This paper unifies the theory of consistent-set maximization for robust
outlier detection in a simultaneous localization and mapping framework. We
first describe the notion of pairwise consistency before discussing how a
consistency graph can be formed by evaluating pairs of measurements for
consistency. Finding the largest set of consistent measurements is transformed
into an instance of the maximum clique problem and can be solved relatively
quickly using existing maximum-clique solvers. We then generalize our algorithm
to check consistency on a group-$k$ basis by using a generalized notion of
consistency and using generalized graphs. We also present modified maximum
clique algorithms that function on generalized graphs to find the set of
measurements that is internally group-$k$ consistent. We address the
exponential nature of group-$k$ consistency and present methods that can
substantially decrease the number of necessary checks performed when evaluating
consistency. We extend our prior work to multi-agent systems in both simulation
and hardware and provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Type inference methods based on deep learning are becoming increasingly
popular as they aim to compensate for the drawbacks of static and dynamic
analysis approaches, such as high uncertainty. However, their practical
application is still debatable due to several intrinsic issues such as code
from different software domains will involve data types that are unknown to the
type inference system. In order to overcome these problems and gain
high-confidence predictions, we thus present TIPICAL, a method that combines
deep similarity learning with novelty detection. We show that our method can
better predict data types in high confidence by successfully filtering out
unknown and inaccurate predicted data types and achieving higher F1 scores to
the state-of-the-art type inference method Type4Py. Additionally, we
investigate how different software domains and data type frequencies may affect
the results of our method.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider a challenging secure wireless sensing scenario
where a legitimate radar station (LRS) intends to detect a target at unknown
location in the presence of an unauthorized radar station (URS). We aim to
enhance the sensing performance of the LRS and in the meanwhile prevent the
detection of the same target by the URS. Under this setup, conventional
stealth-based approaches such as wrapping the target with electromagnetic wave
absorbing materials are not applicable, since they will disable the target
detection by not only the URS, but the LRS as well. To tackle this challenge,
we propose in this paper a new target-mounted IRS approach, where intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) is mounted on the outer/echo surface of the target and
by tuning the IRS reflection, the strength of its reflected radar signal in any
angle of departure (AoD) can be adjusted based on the signal's angle of arrival
(AoA), thereby enhancing/suppressing the signal power towards the LRS/URS,
respectively. To this end, we propose a practical protocol for the
target-mounted IRS to estimate the LRS/URS channel and waveform parameters
based on its sensed signals and control the IRS reflection for/against the
LRS/URS accordingly. Specifically, we formulate new optimization problems to
design the reflecting phase shifts at IRS for maximizing the received signal
power at the LRS while keeping that at the URS below a certain level, for both
the cases of short-term and long-term IRS operations with different dynamic
reflection capabilities. To solve these non-convex problems, we apply the
penalty dual decomposition method to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions
for them efficiently. Finally, simulation results are presented that verify the
effectiveness of the proposed protocol and algorithms for the target-mounted
IRS to achieve secure wireless sensing, as compared with various benchmark
schemes.

<p class="mathjax">With the advent of new technologies and endeavors for automation in almost
all day-to-day activities, the recent discussions on the metaverse life have a
greater expectation. Furthermore, we are in the era of the fifth industrial
revolution, where machines and humans collaborate to maximize productivity with
the effective utilization of human intelligence and other resources. Hence,
Industry 5.0 in the metaverse may have tremendous technological integration for
a more immersive experience and enhanced communication.These technological
amalgamations are suitable for the present environment and entirely different
from the previous perception of virtual technologies. This work presents a
comprehensive review of the applications of the metaverse in Industry 5.0
(so-called industrial metaverse). In particular, we first provide a preliminary
to the metaverse and industry 5.0 and discuss key enabling technologies of the
industrial metaverse, including virtual and augmented reality, 3D modeling,
artificial intelligence, edge computing, digital twin, blockchain, and 6G
communication networks. This work then explores diverse metaverse applications
in Industry 5.0 vertical domains like Society 5.0, agriculture, supply chain
management, healthcare, education, and transportation. A number of research
projects are presented to showcase the conceptualization and implementation of
the industrial metaverse. Furthermore, various challenges in realizing the
industrial metaverse, feasible solutions, and future directions for further
research have been presented.

<p class="mathjax">Constructive visualization uses physical data units - tokens - to enable
non-experts to create personalized visualizations engagingly. However, its
physical nature limits efficiency and scalability. One potential solution to
address this issue is autocomplete. By providing automated suggestions while
still allowing for manual intervention, autocomplete can expedite visualization
construction while maintaining expressivity. We conduct a speculative design
study to examine how people would like to interact with a visualization
authoring system that supports autocomplete. Our study identifies three types
of autocomplete strategies and gains insights for designing future
visualization authoring tools with autocomplete functionality. A free copy of

<p class="mathjax">The increasing usage of new data sources and machine learning (ML) technology
in credit modeling raises concerns with regards to potentially unfair
decision-making that rely on protected characteristics (e.g., race, sex, age)
or other socio-economic and demographic data. The authors demonstrate the
impact of such algorithmic bias in the microfinance context. Difficulties in
assessing credit are disproportionately experienced among vulnerable groups,
however, very little is known about inequities in credit allocation between
groups defined, not only by single, but by multiple and intersecting social
categories. Drawing from the intersectionality paradigm, the study examines
intersectional horizontal inequities in credit access by gender, age, marital
status, single parent status and number of children. This paper utilizes data
from the Spanish microfinance market as its context to demonstrate how
pluralistic realities and intersectional identities can shape patterns of
credit allocation when using automated decision-making systems. With ML
technology being oblivious to societal good or bad, we find that a more
thorough examination of intersectionality can enhance the algorithmic fairness
lens to more authentically empower action for equitable outcomes and present a
fairer path forward. We demonstrate that while on a high-level, fairness may
exist superficially, unfairness can exacerbate at lower levels given
combinatorial effects; in other words, the core fairness problem may be more
complicated than current literature demonstrates. We find that in addition to
legally protected characteristics, sensitive attributes such as single parent
status and number of children can result in imbalanced harm. We discuss the
implications of these findings for the financial services industry.

<p class="mathjax">This paper reports on the results of the six-month pilot MARTA Reach, which
aimed to demonstrate the potential value of On-Demand Multimodal Transit
Systems (ODMTS) in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. ODMTS take a transit-centric
view by integrating on-demand services and traditional fixed routes in order to
address the first/last mile problem. ODMTS combine fixed routes and on-demand
shuttle services by design (not as an after-thought) into a transit system that
offers a door-to-door multimodal service with fully integrated operations and
fare structure. The paper fills a knowledge gap, i.e., the understanding of the
impact, benefits, and challenges of deploying an ODMTS in a city as complex as
Atlanta, Georgia. The pilot was deployed in four different zones with limited
transit options, and used on-demand shuttles integrated with the overall
transit system to address the first/last mile problem. The paper describes the
design and operations of the pilot, and presents the results in terms of
ridership, quality of service, trip purposes, alternative modes of
transportation, multimodal nature of trips, challenges encountered, and cost
estimates. The main findings of the pilot are that Reach offered a highly
valued service that performed a large number of trips that would have otherwise
been served by ride-hailing companies, taxis, or personal cars. Moreover, the
wide majority of Reach trips were multimodal, with connections to rail being
most prominent

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a post hoc analysis of a deep learning-based full-disk
solar flare prediction model. We used hourly full-disk line-of-sight
magnetogram images and selected binary prediction mode to predict the
occurrence of $\geq$M1.0-class flares within 24 hours. We leveraged custom data
augmentation and sample weighting to counter the inherent class-imbalance
problem and used true skill statistic and Heidke skill score as evaluation
metrics. Recent advancements in gradient-based attention methods allow us to
interpret models by sending gradient signals to assign the burden of the
decision on the input features. We interpret our model using three post hoc
attention methods: (i) Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, (ii)
Deep Shapley Additive Explanations, and (iii) Integrated Gradients. Our
analysis shows that full-disk predictions of solar flares align with
characteristics related to the active regions. The key findings of this study
are: (1) We demonstrate that our full disk model can tangibly locate and
predict near-limb solar flares, which is a critical feature for operational
flare forecasting, (2) Our candidate model achieves an average
TSS=0.51$\pm$0.05 and HSS=0.38$\pm$0.08, and (3) Our evaluation suggests that
these models can learn conspicuous features corresponding to active regions
from full-disk magnetograms.

<p class="mathjax">In this article we design a finite volume semi-implicit IMEX scheme for the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on evolving Chimera meshes. We employ a
time discretization technique that separates explicit and implicit terms which
encompass both slow and fast scales. The finite volume approach for both
explicit and implicit terms allows to encode into the nonlinear flux the
velocity of displacement of the Chimera mesh via integration on moving cells.
To attain second-order time accuracy, we employ semi-implicit IMEX Runge-Kutta
schemes. These novel schemes are combined with a fractional-step method, thus
the governing equations are eventually solved using a projection method to
satisfy the divergence-free constraint of the velocity field. The implicit
discretization of the viscous terms allows the CFL-type stability condition for
the maximum admissible time step to be only defined by the relative fluid
velocity referred to the movement of the frame and not depending also on the
viscous eigenvalues. Communication between different grid blocks is enabled
through compact exchange of information from the fringe cells of one mesh block
to the field cells of the other block. Taking advantage of the continuity of
the solution and the definition of a minimal compact stencil, the numerical
solution of any system of differential equations is characterized by continuous
data extrapolation. Free-stream preservation property, i.e. compliance with the
Geometric Conservation Law (GCL), is respected. The accuracy and capabilities
of the new numerical schemes is proved through an extensive range of test
cases, demonstrating ability to solve relevant benchmarks in the field of
incompressible fluids.

<p class="mathjax">Despite its ever-increasing impact, security is not considered as a design
objective in commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tools. This results
in vulnerabilities being overlooked during the software-hardware design
process. Specifically, vulnerabilities that allow leakage of sensitive data
might stay unnoticed by standard testing, as the leakage itself might not
result in evident functional changes. Therefore, EDA tools are needed to
elaborate the confidentiality of sensitive data during the design process.
However, state-of-the-art implementations either solely consider the hardware
or restrict the expressiveness of the security properties that must be proven.
Consequently, more proficient tools are required to assist in the software and
hardware design. To address this issue, we propose SoftFlow, an EDA tool that
allows determining whether a given software exploits existing leakage paths in
hardware. Based on our analysis, the leakage paths can be retained if proven
not to be exploited by software. This is desirable if the removal significantly
impacts the design's performance or functionality, or if the path cannot be
removed as the chip is already manufactured. We demonstrate the feasibility of
SoftFlow by identifying vulnerabilities in OpenSSL cryptographic C programs,
and redesigning them to avoid leakage of cryptographic keys in a RISC-V
architecture.

prevention where accurate estimates of FPR are critical to preserving the
experience for good customers, and where label noise is highly asymmetric.
Existing methods seek to minimize the total error in the cleaning process - to
avoid cleaning examples that are not noise, and to ensure cleaning of examples
that are. This is an important measure of accuracy but insufficient to
guarantee good estimates of the true FPR or TPR for a model, and we show that
using the model to directly clean its own validation data leads to
underestimates even if total error is low. This indicates a need for
researchers to pursue methods that not only reduce total error but also seek to
de-correlate cleaning error with model scores.

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) with I/Q imbalance
(IQI) at transceivers by employing a combination of improper Gaussian signaling
(IGS), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and simultaneously transmit and
reflect (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). When there exists IQI,
the output RF signal is a widely linear transformation of the input signal,
which may make the output signal improper. To compensate for IQI, we employ
IGS, thus generating a transmit improper signal. We show that IGS alongside
with NOMA can highly increase the minimum rate of the users. Moreover, we
propose schemes for different operational modes of STAR-RIS and show that
STAR-RIS can significantly improve the system performance. Additionally, we
show that IQI can highly degrade the performance especially if it is overlooked
in the design.

<p class="mathjax">The well-known Asplund theorem states that the inverse of a (possibly
one-sided) band matrix $A$ is a Green matrix. In accordance with quasiseparable
theory, such a matrix admits a quasiseparable representation in its
rank-structured part. Based on this idea, we derive algorithms that compute a
quasiseparable representation of $A^{-1}$ with linear complexity. Many
inversion algorithms for band matrices exist in the literature. However,
algorithms based on a computation of the rank structure performed theoretically
via the Asplund theorem appear for the first time in this paper. Numerical
experiments confirm complexity estimates and offer insight into stability
properties.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of computing bounds for causal queries on causal
graphs with unobserved confounders and discrete valued observed variables,
where identifiability does not hold. Existing non-parametric approaches for
computing such bounds use linear programming (LP) formulations that quickly
become intractable for existing solvers because the size of the LP grows
exponentially in the number of edges in the causal graph. We show that this LP
can be significantly pruned, allowing us to compute bounds for significantly
larger causal inference problems compared to existing techniques. This pruning
procedure allows us to compute bounds in closed form for a special class of
problems, including a well-studied family of problems where multiple confounded
treatments influence an outcome. We extend our pruning methodology to
fractional LPs which compute bounds for causal queries which incorporate
additional observations about the unit. We show that our methods provide
significant runtime improvement compared to benchmarks in experiments and
extend our results to the finite data setting. For causal inference without
additional observations, we propose an efficient greedy heuristic that produces
high quality bounds, and scales to problems that are several orders of
magnitude larger than those for which the pruned LP can be solved.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning has rapidly evolved during the last decade, achieving expert
human performance on notoriously challenging problems such as image
classification. This success is partly due to the re-emergence of bio-inspired
modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) along with the availability of
computation power, vast labelled data and ingenious human-based expert
knowledge as well as optimisation approaches that can find the correct
configuration (and weights) for these networks. Neuroevolution is a term used
for the latter when employing evolutionary algorithms. Most of the works in
neuroevolution have focused their attention in a single type of ANNs, named
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, most of these works have used a
single optimisation approach. This work makes a progressive step forward in
neuroevolution for vehicle trajectory prediction, referred to as
neurotrajectory prediction, where multiple objectives must be considered. To
this end, rich ANNs composed of CNNs and Long-short Term Memory Network are
adopted. Two well-known and robust Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation
(EMO) algorithms, NSGA-II and MOEA/D are also adopted. The completely different
underlying mechanism of each of these algorithms sheds light on the
implications of using one over the other EMO approach in neurotrajectory
prediction. In particular, the importance of considering objective scaling is
highlighted, finding that MOEA/D can be more adept at focusing on specific
objectives whereas, NSGA-II tends to be more invariant to objective scaling.
Additionally, certain objectives are shown to be either beneficial or
detrimental to finding valid models, for instance, inclusion of a distance
feedback objective was considerably detrimental to finding valid models, while
a lateral velocity objective was more beneficial.

<p class="mathjax">Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI) plays a vital role in ensuring
secure and privacy-preserving communication in vehicular ad hoc networks
(VANETs). However, current VPKI architectures face significant challenges in
terms of scalability, resilience, and privacy preservation. This paper proposes
a novel threshold-based VPKI architecture to overcome these limitations.
Leveraging a Schnorr threshold signature scheme based on elliptic curve
cryptography, the proposed architecture eliminates the reliance on individual
certificate authorities (CAs) and distributes trust among multiple CAs in a
threshold certificate signing approach. This enhances resilience and mitigates
the single point-of-failure vulnerability. The architecture also addresses
sybil-based misbehaviors through a time-restrictive pseudonym design that
eliminates multiple simultaneous use of pseudonyms. Furthermore, the scheme
reduces the size and latency of Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution
by clustering multiple CAs in a threshold setting and adopting a
region-specific CRL. The paper presents detailed analysis of the security,
privacy and performance benefits of the proposed architecture. Results from the
performance evaluation shows the improved resiliency, reduced handover rates,
and better scalability potential of the proposed threshold-based VPKI
architecture compared to existing techniques. The proposed threshold-based VPKI
holds great promise in ensuring secure and privacy-preserving communication in
VANETs, paving the way for safer and more efficient vehicular networks.

<p class="mathjax">Inferring liquid properties from vision is a challenging task due to the
complex nature of fluids, both in behavior and detection. Nevertheless, the
ability to infer their properties directly from visual information is highly
valuable for autonomous fluid handling systems, as cameras are readily
available. Moreover, predicting fluid properties purely from vision can
accelerate the process of fluid characterization saving considerable time and
effort in various experimental environments. In this work, we present a purely
vision-based approach to estimate viscosity, leveraging the fact that the
behavior of the fluid oscillations is directly related to the viscosity.
Specifically, we utilize a 3D convolutional autoencoder to learn latent
representations of different fluid-oscillating patterns present in videos. We
leverage this latent representation to visually infer the category of fluid or
the dynamics viscosity of fluid from video.

<p class="mathjax">In deep learning research, many melody extraction models rely on redesigning
neural network architectures to improve performance. In this paper, we propose
an input feature modification and a training objective modification based on
two assumptions. First, harmonics in the spectrograms of audio data decay
rapidly along the frequency axis. To enhance the model's sensitivity on the
trailing harmonics, we modify the Combined Frequency and Periodicity (CFP)
representation using discrete z-transform. Second, the vocal and non-vocal
segments with extremely short duration are uncommon. To ensure a more stable
melody contour, we design a differentiable loss function that prevents the
model from predicting such segments. We apply these modifications to several
models, including MSNet, FTANet, and a newly introduced model, PianoNet,
modified from a piano transcription network. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed modifications are empirically effective for
singing melody extraction.

<p class="mathjax">Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) encodes policies
in human-readable computer programs. Novel algorithms were recently introduced
with the goal of handling the lack of gradient signal to guide the search in
the space of programmatic policies. Most of such PIRL algorithms first train a
neural policy that is used as an oracle to guide the search in the programmatic
space. In this paper, we show that such PIRL-specific algorithms are not
needed, depending on the language used to encode the programmatic policies.
This is because one can use actor-critic algorithms to directly obtain a
programmatic policy. We use a connection between ReLU neural networks and
oblique decision trees to translate the policy learned with actor-critic
algorithms into programmatic policies. This translation from ReLU networks
allows us to synthesize policies encoded in programs with if-then-else
structures, linear transformations of the input values, and PID operations.
Empirical results on several control problems show that this translation
approach is capable of learning short and effective policies. Moreover, the
translated policies are at least competitive and often far superior to the
policies PIRL algorithms synthesize.

<p class="mathjax">Stress is widely recognized as a major contributor to a variety of health
issues. Stress prediction using biosignal data recorded by wearables is a key
area of study in mobile sensing research because real-time stress prediction
can enable digital interventions to immediately react at the onset of stress,
helping to avoid many psychological and physiological symptoms such as heart
rhythm irregularities. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is often used to measure
stress. However, major challenges with the prediction of stress using machine
learning include the subjectivity and sparseness of the labels, a large feature
space, relatively few labels, and a complex nonlinear and subjective
relationship between the features and outcomes. To tackle these issues, we
examine the use of model personalization: training a separate stress prediction
model for each user. To allow the neural network to learn the temporal dynamics
of each individual's baseline biosignal patterns, thus enabling personalization
with very few labels, we pre-train a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network
(CNN) using self-supervised learning (SSL). We evaluate our method using the
Wearable Stress and Affect prediction (WESAD) dataset. We fine-tune the
pre-trained networks to the stress prediction task and compare against
equivalent models without any self-supervised pre-training. We discover that
embeddings learned using our pre-training method outperform supervised
baselines with significantly fewer labeled data points: the models trained with
SSL require less than 30% of the labels to reach equivalent performance without
personalized SSL. This personalized learning method can enable precision health
systems which are tailored to each subject and require few annotations by the
end user, thus allowing for the mobile sensing of increasingly complex,
heterogeneous, and subjective outcomes such as stress.

leverages the Sliding-Window Upper-Confidence Bound to learn the channels'
statistics under non-stationarity. MW-UCB is provably throughput-optimal under
mild assumptions on the variability of mean service rates. Specifically, as
long as the total variation in mean service rates over any time period grows
sub-linearly in time, we show that MW-UCB can achieve the stability region
arbitrarily close to the stability region of the class of policies with full
knowledge of the channel statistics. Extensive simulations validate our
theoretical results and demonstrate the favorable performance of MW-UCB.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, visual-language learning has shown great potential in enhancing
visual-based person re-identification (ReID). Existing visual-language
learning-based ReID methods often focus on whole-body scale image-text feature
alignment, while neglecting supervisions on fine-grained part features. This
choice simplifies the learning process but cannot guarantee within-part feature
semantic consistency thus hindering the final performance. Therefore, we
propose to enhance fine-grained visual features with part-informed language
supervision for ReID tasks. The proposed method, named Part-Informed
Visual-language Learning ($\pi$-VL), suggests that (i) a human parsing-guided
prompt tuning strategy and (ii) a hierarchical fusion-based visual-language
alignment paradigm play essential roles in ensuring within-part feature
semantic consistency. Specifically, we combine both identity labels and parsing
maps to constitute pixel-level text prompts and fuse multi-stage visual
features with a light-weight auxiliary head to perform fine-grained image-text
alignment. As a plug-and-play and inference-free solution, our $\pi$-VL
achieves substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-arts on four
common-used ReID benchmarks, especially reporting 90.3% Rank-1 and 76.5% mAP
for the most challenging MSMT17 database without bells and whistles.

single free-flying deputy spacecraft, equipped with an optical sensor, whose
controller is a neural network control system trained with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). This work considers the illumination of the inspected spacecraft
(chief) by the Sun in order to incentivize acquisition of well-illuminated
optical data. The agent's performance is evaluated through statistically
efficient metrics. Results demonstrate that the RL agent is able to inspect all
points on the chief successfully, while maximizing illumination on inspected
points in a simulated environment, using only low-level actions. Due to the
stochastic nature of RL, 10 policies were trained using 10 random seeds to
obtain a more holistic measure of agent performance. Over these 10 seeds, the
interquartile mean (IQM) percentage of inspected points for the finalized model
was 98.82%.

<p class="mathjax">Text classification is a fundamental task for natural language processing,
and adapting text classification models across domains has broad applications.
Self-training generates pseudo-examples from the model's predictions and
iteratively trains on the pseudo-examples, i.e., minimizes the loss on the
source domain and the Gibbs entropy on the target domain. However, Gibbs
entropy is sensitive to prediction errors, and thus, self-training tends to
fail when the domain shift is large. In this paper, we propose Meta-Tsallis
Entropy minimization (MTEM), which applies a meta-learning algorithm to
optimize the instance adaptive Tsallis entropy on the target domain. To reduce
the computation cost of MTEM, we propose an approximation technique to
approximate the Second-order derivation involved in the meta-learning. To
efficiently generate pseudo labels, we propose an annealing sampling mechanism
for exploring the model's prediction probability. Theoretically, we prove the
convergence of the meta-learning algorithm in MTEM and analyze the
effectiveness of MTEM in achieving domain adaptation. Experimentally, MTEM
improves the adaptation performance of BERT with an average of 4 percent on the
benchmark dataset.

peer-to-peer federated learning. We analyze the robustness of the known
variational Bayesian peer-to-peer federated learning framework (BayP2PFL)
against poisoning attacks and subsequently show that BayP2PFL is not robust
against those attacks. The new SABRE aggregation methodology is then devised to
overcome the limitations of the existing frameworks. SABRE works well in
non-IID settings, does not require the majority of the benign nodes over the
compromised ones, and even outperforms the baseline algorithm in benign
settings. We theoretically prove the robustness of our algorithm against data /
model poisoning attacks in a decentralized linear regression setting.
Proof-of-Concept evaluations on benchmark data from image classification
demonstrate the superiority of SABRE over the existing frameworks under various
poisoning attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Perception-related errors comprise most diagnostic mistakes in radiology. To
mitigate this problem, radiologists employ personalized and high-dimensional
visual search strategies, otherwise known as search patterns. Qualitative
descriptions of these search patterns, which involve the physician verbalizing
or annotating the order he/she analyzes the image, can be unreliable due to
discrepancies in what is reported versus the actual visual patterns. This
discrepancy can interfere with quality improvement interventions and negatively
impact patient care. This study presents a novel discretized feature encoding
based on spatiotemporal binning of fixation data for efficient geometric
alignment and temporal ordering of eye movement when reading chest X-rays. The
encoded features of the eye-fixation data are employed by machine learning
classifiers to discriminate between faculty and trainee radiologists. We
include a clinical trial case study utilizing the Area Under the Curve (AUC),
Accuracy, F1, Sensitivity, and Specificity metrics for class separability to
evaluate the discriminability between the two subjects in regard to their level
of experience. We then compare the classification performance to
state-of-the-art methodologies. A repeatability experiment using a separate
dataset, experimental protocol, and eye tracker was also performed using eight
subjects to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach. The numerical
results from both experiments demonstrate that classifiers employing the
proposed feature encoding methods outperform the current state-of-the-art in
differentiating between radiologists in terms of experience level. This
signifies the potential impact of the proposed method for identifying
radiologists' level of expertise and those who would benefit from additional
training.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized many Machine Learning (ML)
applications, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, etc. GNN
inference can be accelerated by exploiting data sparsity in the input graph,
vertex features, and intermediate data in GNN computations. For dynamic
sparsity exploitation, we leverage the heterogeneous computing capabilities of
AMD Versal ACAP architecture to accelerate GNN inference. We develop a custom
hardware module that executes the sparse primitives of the computation kernel
on the Programmable Logic (PL) and efficiently computes the dense primitives
using the AI Engine (AIE). To exploit data sparsity during inference, we devise
a runtime kernel mapping strategy that dynamically assigns computation tasks to
the PL and AIE based on data sparsity. Our implementation on the VCK5000 ACAP
platform leads to superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art
implementations on CPU, GPU, ACAP, and other custom GNN accelerators. Compared
with these implementations, we achieve significant average runtime speedup
across various models and datasets of 162.42x, 17.01x, 9.90x, and 27.23x,
respectively. Furthermore, for Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) inference, our
approach leads to a speedup of 3.9-96.7x compared to designs using PL only on
the same ACAP device.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Fields or NeRFs have become the representation of choice for
problems in view synthesis or image-based rendering, as well as in many other
applications across computer graphics and vision, and beyond. At their core,
NeRFs describe a new representation of 3D scenes or 3D geometry. Instead of
meshes, disparity maps, multiplane images or even voxel grids, they represent
the scene as a continuous volume, with volumetric parameters like
view-dependent radiance and volume density obtained by querying a neural
network. The NeRF representation has now been widely used, with thousands of
papers extending or building on it every year, multiple authors and websites
providing overviews and surveys, and numerous industrial applications and
startup companies. In this article, we briefly review the NeRF representation,
and describe the three decades-long quest to find the best 3D representation
for view synthesis and related problems, culminating in the NeRF papers. We
then describe new developments in terms of NeRF representations and make some
observations and insights regarding the future of 3D representations.

<p class="mathjax">The statistical distribution of content uploaded and searched on media
sharing sites changes over time due to seasonal, sociological and technical
factors. We investigate the impact of this "content drift" for large-scale
similarity search tools, based on nearest neighbor search in embedding space.
Unless a costly index reconstruction is performed frequently, content drift
degrades the search accuracy and efficiency. The degradation is especially
severe since, in general, both the query and database distributions change.
<br />We introduce and analyze real-world image and video datasets for which
temporal information is available over a long time period. Based on the
learnings, we devise DeDrift, a method that updates embedding quantizers to
continuously adapt large-scale indexing structures on-the-fly. DeDrift almost
eliminates the accuracy degradation due to the query and database content drift
while being up to 100x faster than a full index reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">Self-training emerges as an important research line on domain adaptation. By
taking the model's prediction as the pseudo labels of the unlabeled data,
self-training bootstraps the model with pseudo instances in the target domain.
However, the prediction errors of pseudo labels (label noise) challenge the
performance of self-training. To address this problem, previous approaches only
use reliable pseudo instances, i.e., pseudo instances with high prediction
confidence, to retrain the model. Although these strategies effectively reduce
the label noise, they are prone to miss the hard examples. In this paper, we
propose a new self-training framework for domain adaptation, namely Domain
adversarial learning enhanced Self-Training Framework (DaMSTF). Firstly, DaMSTF
involves meta-learning to estimate the importance of each pseudo instance, so
as to simultaneously reduce the label noise and preserve hard examples.
Secondly, we design a meta constructor for constructing the meta-validation
set, which guarantees the effectiveness of the meta-learning module by
improving the quality of the meta-validation set. Thirdly, we find that the
meta-learning module suffers from the training guidance vanishment and tends to
converge to an inferior optimal. To this end, we employ domain adversarial
learning as a heuristic neural network initialization method, which can help
the meta-learning module converge to a better optimal. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DaMSTF. On the
cross-domain sentiment classification task, DaMSTF improves the performance of
BERT with an average of nearly 4%.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of physiological sensors opens new opportunities to explore
interactions, conduct experiments and evaluate the user experience with
continuous monitoring of bodily functions. Commercial devices, however, can be
costly or limit access to raw waveform data, while low-cost sensors are
efforts-intensive to setup. To address these challenges, we introduce
PhysioKit, an open-source, low-cost physiological computing toolkit. PhysioKit
consists of (i) a sensor and hardware layer that can be configured in a modular
manner per research needs, (ii) a software application layer that enables data
acquisition, real-time visualization and machine learning (ML)-enabled signal
quality assessment. This also supports basic visual biofeedback configurations
and synchronized acquisition for co-located or remote multi-user settings. In a

<p class="mathjax">Neural Collapse (NC) gives a precise description of the representations of
classes in the final hidden layer of classification neural networks. This
description provides insights into how these networks learn features and
generalize well when trained past zero training error. However, to date, (NC)
has only been studied in the final layer of these networks. In the present
paper, we provide the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the emergence
of (NC) in the intermediate hidden layers of these classifiers. We examine a
variety of network architectures, activations, and datasets, and demonstrate
that some degree of (NC) emerges in most of the intermediate hidden layers of
the network, where the degree of collapse in any given layer is typically
positively correlated with the depth of that layer in the neural network.
Moreover, we remark that: (1) almost all of the reduction in intra-class
variance in the samples occurs in the shallower layers of the networks, (2) the
angular separation between class means increases consistently with hidden layer
depth, and (3) simple datasets require only the shallower layers of the
networks to fully learn them, whereas more difficult ones require the entire
network. Ultimately, these results provide granular insights into the
structural propagation of features through classification neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">We present the first decentralized algorithm for detecting predicates over
continuous-time signals under partial synchrony. A distributed cyber-physical
system (CPS) consists of a network of agents, each of which measures (or
computes) a continuous-time signal. Examples include distributed industrial
controllers connected over wireless networks and connected vehicles in traffic.
The safety requirements of such CPS, expressed as logical predicates, must be
monitored at runtime. This monitoring faces three challenges: first, every
agent only knows its own signal, whereas the safety requirement is global and
carries over multiple signals. Second, the agents' local clocks drift from each
other, so they do not even agree on the time. Thus, it is not clear which
signal values are actually synchronous to evaluate the safety predicate. Third,
CPS signals are continuous-time so there are potentially uncountably many
safety violations to be reported. In this paper, we present the first
decentralized algorithm for detecting conjunctive predicates in this setup. Our
algorithm returns all possible violations of the predicate, which is important
for eliminating bugs from distributed systems regardless of actual clock drift.
We prove that this detection algorithm is in the same complexity class as the
detector for discrete systems. We implement our detector and validate it
experimentally.

for large-scale multidimensional data. As a "born scalable" query technique,
AQS starts visualization with a single visual mark representing an aggregation
of the entire dataset. The user can then progressively explore the dataset
through a sequence of operations abbreviated as P6: pivot (facet an aggregate
based on an attribute), partition (lay out a facet in space), peek (see inside
a subset using an aggregate visual representation), pile (merge two or more
subsets), project (extracting a subset into a new substrate), and prune
(discard an aggregate not currently of interest). We validate AQS with
Dataopsy, a prototype implementation of AQS that has been designed for fluid

<p class="mathjax">The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is widely used in industrial waste heat
recovery due to its simple structure and easy maintenance. However, in the
context of smart manufacturing in the process industry, traditional model-based
optimization control methods are unable to adapt to the varying operating
conditions of the ORC system or sudden changes in operating modes. Deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has significant advantages in situations with
uncertainty as it directly achieves control objectives by interacting with the
environment without requiring an explicit model of the controlled plant.
Nevertheless, direct application of DRL to physical ORC systems presents
unacceptable safety risks, and its generalization performance under model-plant
mismatch is insufficient to support ORC control requirements. Therefore, this
paper proposes a Sim2Real transfer learning-based DRL control method for ORC
superheat control, which aims to provide a new simple, feasible, and
user-friendly solution for energy system optimization control. Experimental
results show that the proposed method greatly improves the training speed of
DRL in ORC control problems and solves the generalization performance issue of
the agent under multiple operating conditions through Sim2Real transfer.

<p class="mathjax">Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is very well known for its potential
application in in-memory and neural computing. However, they often have
different types of device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variability. This makes
it harder to build highly accurate crossbar arrays.Traditional RRAM designs
make use of various filament-based oxide materials for creating a channel which
is sandwiched between two electrodes to form a two-terminal structure. They are
often subjected to mechanical and electrical stress over repeated
read-and-write cycles. The behavior of these devices often varies in practice
across wafer arrays over these stress when fabricated. The use of emerging 2D
materials is explored to improve electrical endurance, long retention In review
time, high switching speed, and fewer power losses. This study provides an
in-depth exploration of neuro-memristive computing and its potential
applications, focusing specifically on the utilization of graphene and 2D
materials in resistive random-access memory (RRAM) for neural computing. The
paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the structural and design aspects of
graphene-based RRAM, along with a thorough examination of commercially
available RRAM models and their fabrication techniques. Furthermore, the study
investigates the diverse range of applications that can benefit from
graphene-based RRAM devices.

<p class="mathjax">Factor graph represents the factorization of a probability distribution
function and serves as an effective abstraction in various autonomous machine
computing tasks. Control is one of the core applications in autonomous machine
computing stacks. Among all control algorithms, Linear Quadratic Regulator
(LQR) offers one of the best trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy.
However, due to the inherent iterative process and extensive computation, it is
a challenging task for the autonomous systems with real-time limits and energy
constrained.
<br />In this paper, we present FGLQR, an accelerator of LQR control for autonomous
machines using the abstraction of a factor graph. By transforming the dynamic
equation constraints into least squares constraints, the factor graph solving
process is more hardware friendly and accelerated with almost no loss in
accuracy. With a domain specific parallel solving pattern, FGLQR achieves 10.2x
speed up and 32.9x energy reduction compared to the software implementation on
an advanced Intel CPU.

<p class="mathjax">Recognizing characters from low-resolution (LR) text images poses a
significant challenge due to the information deficiency as well as the noise
and blur in low-quality images. Current solutions for low-resolution text
recognition (LTR) typically rely on a two-stage pipeline that involves
super-resolution as the first stage followed by the second-stage recognition.
Although this pipeline is straightforward and intuitive, it has to use an
additional super-resolution network, which causes inefficiencies during
training and testing. Moreover, the recognition accuracy of the second stage
heavily depends on the reconstruction quality of the first stage, causing
ineffectiveness. In this work, we attempt to address these challenges from a
novel perspective: adapting the recognizer to low-resolution inputs by
transferring the knowledge from the high-resolution. Guided by this idea, we
propose an efficient and effective knowledge distillation framework to achieve
multi-level knowledge transfer. Specifically, the visual focus loss is proposed
to extract the character position knowledge with resolution gap reduction and
character region focus, the semantic contrastive loss is employed to exploit
the contextual semantic knowledge with contrastive learning, and the soft
logits loss facilitates both local word-level and global sequence-level
learning from the soft teacher label. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed one-stage pipeline significantly outperforms super-resolution based
two-stage frameworks in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, accompanied by
favorable robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/KD-LTR.

(LLM)-based chatbot system in the education domain. Its goal is to support
personalized, fair, and compassionate intelligent education, serving teachers,
students, and parents. Guided by theories from psychology and education, it
further strengthens educational functions such as open question answering,
essay assessment, Socratic teaching, and emotional support based on the
existing basic LLMs. Particularly, we learn domain-specific knowledge by
pre-training on the educational corpus and stimulate various skills with tool
use by fine-tuning on designed system prompts and instructions. Currently,
EduChat is available online as an open-source project, with its code, data, and
model parameters available on platforms (e.g., GitHub
https://github.com/icalk-nlp/EduChat, Hugging Face
https://huggingface.co/ecnu-icalk ). We also prepare a demonstration of its

<p class="mathjax">Although low-light image enhancement has achieved great stride based on deep
enhancement models, most of them mainly stress on enhancement performance via
an elaborated black-box network and rarely explore the physical significance of
enhancement models. Towards this issue, we propose a Dual degrAdation-inSpired
deep Unfolding network, termed DASUNet, for low-light image enhancement.
Specifically, we construct a dual degradation model (DDM) to explicitly
simulate the deterioration mechanism of low-light images. It learns two
distinct image priors via considering degradation specificity between luminance
and chrominance spaces. To make the proposed scheme tractable, we design an
alternating optimization solution to solve the proposed DDM. Further, the
designed solution is unfolded into a specified deep network, imitating the
iteration updating rules, to form DASUNet. Local and long-range information are
obtained by prior modeling module (PMM), inheriting the advantages of
convolution and Transformer, to enhance the representation capability of dual
degradation priors. Additionally, a space aggregation module (SAM) is presented
to boost the interaction of two degradation models. Extensive experiments on
multiple popular low-light image datasets validate the effectiveness of DASUNet
compared to canonical state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement methods. Our
source code and pretrained model will be publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">For Open Source Software (OSS) projects, discussions in Issue Tracking
Systems (ITS) serve as a crucial collaboration mechanism for diverse
stakeholders. However, these discussions can become lengthy and entangled,
making it hard to find relevant information and make further contributions. In
this work, we study the use of summarization to aid users in collaboratively
making sense of OSS issue discussion threads. We reveal a complex picture of
how summarization is used by issue users in practice as a strategy to help
develop and manage their discussions. Grounded on the different objectives
served by the summaries and the outcome of our formative study with OSS
stakeholders, we identified a set of guidelines to inform the design of
collaborative summarization tools for OSS issue discussions. We then developed
SUMMIT, a tool that allows issue users to collectively construct summaries of
different types of information discussed, as well as a set of comments
representing continuous conversations within the thread. To alleviate the
manual effort involved, SUMMIT uses techniques that automatically detect
information types and summarize texts to facilitate the generation of these
summaries. A lab user study indicates that, as the users of SUMMIT, OSS
stakeholders adopted different strategies to acquire information on issue
threads. Furthermore, different features of SUMMIT effectively lowered the
perceived difficulty of locating information from issue threads and enabled the
users to prioritize their effort. Overall, our findings demonstrated the
potential of SUMMIT, and the corresponding design guidelines, in supporting
users to acquire information from lengthy discussions in ITSs. Our work sheds
light on key design considerations and features when exploring crowd-based and
machine-learning-enabled instruments for asynchronous collaboration on complex
tasks such as OSS development.

<p class="mathjax">Cervical cancer is one of the most severe diseases threatening women's
health. Early detection and diagnosis can significantly reduce cancer risk, in
which cervical cytology classification is indispensable. Researchers have
recently designed many networks for automated cervical cancer diagnosis, but
the limited accuracy and bulky size of these individual models cannot meet
practical application needs. To address this issue, we propose a
Voting-Stacking ensemble strategy, which employs three Inception networks as
base learners and integrates their outputs through a voting ensemble. The
samples misclassified by the ensemble model generate a new training set on
which a linear classification model is trained as the meta-learner and performs
the final predictions. In addition, a multi-level Stacking ensemble framework
is designed to improve performance further. The method is evaluated on the
SIPakMed, Herlev, and Mendeley datasets, achieving accuracies of 100\%, 100\%,
and 100\%, respectively. The experimental results outperform the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating its potential for reducing
screening workload and helping pathologists detect cervical cancer. The source

<p class="mathjax">With the escalated demand of human-machine interfaces for intelligent
systems, development of gaze controlled system have become a necessity. Gaze,
being the non-intrusive form of human interaction, is one of the best suited
approach. Appearance based deep learning models are the most widely used for
gaze estimation. But the performance of these models is entirely influenced by
the size of labeled gaze dataset and in effect affects generalization in
performance. This paper aims to develop a semi-supervised contrastive learning
framework for estimation of gaze direction. With a small labeled gaze dataset,
the framework is able to find a generalized solution even for unseen face
images. In this paper, we have proposed a new contrastive loss paradigm that
maximizes the similarity agreement between similar images and at the same time
reduces the redundancy in embedding representations. Our contrastive regression
framework shows good performance in comparison to several state of the art
contrastive learning techniques used for gaze estimation.

<p class="mathjax">The Bin Packing Problem is a classic problem with wide industrial
applicability. In fact, the efficient packing of items into bins is one of the
toughest challenges in many logistic corporations and is a critical issue for
reducing storage costs or improving vehicle space allocation. In this work, we
resort to our previously published quantum-classical framework known as
Q4RealBPP, and elaborate on the solving of real-world oriented instances of the
Bin Packing Problem. With this purpose, this paper gravitates on the following
characteristics: i) the existence of heterogeneous bins, ii) the extension of
the framework to solve not only three-dimensional, but also one- and
two-dimensional instances of the problem, iii) requirements for item-bin
associations, and iv) delivery priorities. All these features have been tested
in this paper, as well as the ability of Q4RealBPP to solve real-world oriented
instances.

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of learning new classes for semantic segmentation
models from few examples, which is challenging because of the following two
reasons. Firstly, it is difficult to learn from limited novel data to capture
the underlying class distribution. Secondly, it is challenging to retain
knowledge for existing classes and to avoid catastrophic forgetting. For
learning from limited data, we propose a pseudo-labeling strategy to augment
the few-shot training annotations in order to learn novel classes more
effectively. Given only one or a few images labeled with the novel classes and
a much larger set of unlabeled images, we transfer the knowledge from labeled
images to unlabeled images with a coarse-to-fine pseudo-labeling approach in
two steps. Specifically, we first match each labeled image to its nearest
neighbors in the unlabeled image set at the scene level, in order to obtain
images with a similar scene layout. This is followed by obtaining pseudo-labels
within this neighborhood by applying classifiers learned on the few-shot
annotations. In addition, we use knowledge distillation on both labeled and
unlabeled data to retain knowledge on existing classes. We integrate the above
steps into a single convolutional neural network with a unified learning
objective. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and KITTI datasets validate
the efficacy of the proposed approach in the self-driving domain. Code is
available from https://github.com/ChasonJiang/FSCILSS.

<p class="mathjax">The current zero trust model adopted in System-on-Chip (SoC) design is
vulnerable to various malicious entities, and modern SoC designs must
incorporate various security policies to protect sensitive assets from
unauthorized access. These policies involve complex interactions between
multiple IP blocks, which poses challenges for SoC designers and security
experts when implementing these policies and for system validators when
ensuring compliance. Difficulties arise when upgrading policies, reusing IPs
for systems targeting different security requirements, and the subsequent
increase in design time and time-to-market. This paper proposes a generic and
flexible framework, called DiSPEL, for enforcing security policies defined by
the user represented in a formal way for any bus-based SoC design. It employs a
distributed deployment strategy while ensuring trusted bus operations despite
the presence of untrusted IPs. It relies on incorporating a dedicated,
centralized module capable of implementing diverse security policies involving
bus-level interactions while generating the necessary logic and appending in
the bus-level wrapper for IP-level policies. The proposed architecture is
generic and independent of specific security policy types supporting both
synthesizable and non-synthesizable solutions. The experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness and correctness in enforcing the security
requirements and viability due to low overhead in terms of area, delay, and
power consumption tested on open-source standard SoC benchmarks.

both heterogeneity and dynamics of HTG and generates high-quality

We deploy CMT to detect crowdsourcing frauds on an industry-size HTG of a

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed a few attempts of vision transformers for single
image super-resolution (SISR). Since the high resolution of intermediate
features in SISR models increases memory and computational requirements,
efficient SISR transformers are more favored. Based on some popular transformer
backbone, many methods have explored reasonable schemes to reduce the
computational complexity of the self-attention module while achieving
impressive performance. However, these methods only focus on the performance on
the training platform (e.g., Pytorch/Tensorflow) without further optimization
for the deployment platform (e.g., TensorRT). Therefore, they inevitably
contain some redundant operators, posing challenges for subsequent deployment
in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a deployment-friendly
transformer unit, namely UFONE (i.e., UnFolding ONce is Enough), to alleviate
these problems. In each UFONE, we introduce an Inner-patch Transformer Layer
(ITL) to efficiently reconstruct the local structural information from patches
and a Spatial-Aware Layer (SAL) to exploit the long-range dependencies between
patches. Based on UFONE, we propose a Deployment-friendly Inner-patch
Transformer Network (DITN) for the SISR task, which can achieve favorable
performance with low latency and memory usage on both training and deployment
platforms. Furthermore, to further boost the deployment efficiency of the
proposed DITN on TensorRT, we also provide an efficient substitution for layer
normalization and propose a fusion optimization strategy for specific
operators. Extensive experiments show that our models can achieve competitive
results in terms of qualitative and quantitative performance with high
deployment efficiency. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Obesity, the leading cause of many non-communicable diseases, occurs mainly
for eating more than our body requirements and lack of proper activity. So,
being healthy requires heathy diet plans, especially for patients with
comorbidities. But it is difficult to figure out the exact quantity of each
nutrient because nutrients requirement varies based on physical and disease
conditions. In our study we proposed a novel machine learning based system to
predict the amount of nutrients one individual requires for being healthy. We
applied different machine learning algorithms: linear regression, support
vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM on fluid
and 3 other major micronutrients: carbohydrate, protein, fat consumption
prediction. We achieved high accuracy with low root mean square error (RMSE) by
using linear regression in fluid prediction, random forest in carbohydrate
prediction and LightGBM in protein and fat prediction. We believe our diet
recommender system, OBESEYE, is the only of its kind which recommends diet with
the consideration of comorbidities and physical conditions and promote
encouragement to get rid of obesity.

which can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of LiDAR(-inertial)
based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This map is a collection of
voxels that contains one plane feature with 3DOF representation and
corresponding covariance estimation. Considering total map will contain a large
number of coplanar features (kid planes), these kid planes' 3DOF estimation can
be regarded as the measurements with covariance of a larger plane (father
plane). Thus, we design a plane merging module based on union-find which can
save resources and further improve the accuracy of plane fitting. This module
can distinguish the kid planes in different voxels and merge these kid planes
to estimate the father plane. After merging, the father plane 3DOF
representation will be more accurate than the kids plane and the uncertainty
will decrease significantly which can further improve the performance of
LiDAR(-inertial) odometry. Experiments on challenging environments such as
corridors and forests demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of our
method compared to other state-of-the-art methods (see our attached video). By
the way, our implementation VoxelMap++ is open-sourced on GitHub which is
applicable for both non-repetitive scanning LiDARs and traditional scanning

of the reduced-space system that governs the problem of interest. The matrix
operators of the reduced-order model are then inferred from the data using
operator inference. Numerical experiments on a number of nonlinear problems
demonstrate the generalizability of the methodology and the increase in
accuracy that can be obtained over reduced-order modeling methods that employ a
linear subspace approximation.

<p class="mathjax">Despite substantial progress in the field of deep learning, overfitting
persists as a critical challenge, and data augmentation has emerged as a
particularly promising approach due to its capacity to enhance model
generalization in various computer vision tasks. While various strategies have
been proposed, Mixed Sample Data Augmentation (MSDA) has shown great potential
for enhancing model performance and generalization. We introduce a novel mixup
method called MiAMix, which stands for Multi-stage Augmented Mixup. MiAMix
integrates image augmentation into the mixup framework, utilizes multiple
diversified mixing methods concurrently, and improves the mixing method by
randomly selecting mixing mask augmentation methods. Recent methods utilize
saliency information and the MiAMix is designed for computational efficiency as
well, reducing additional overhead and offering easy integration into existing
training pipelines. We comprehensively evaluate MiaMix using four image
benchmarks and pitting it against current state-of-the-art mixed sample data
augmentation techniques to demonstrate that MIAMix improves performance without
heavy computational overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) built on artificial intelligence (AI) are
presented as latent mechanisms for actively detecting fresh attacks over a
complex network. Although review papers are used the systematic review or
simple methods to analyse and criticize the anomaly NIDS works, the current
review uses a traditional way as a quantitative description to find current
gaps by synthesizing and summarizing the data comparison without considering
algorithms performance. This paper presents a systematic and meta-analysis
study of AI for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) focusing on deep
learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches in network security. Deep
learning algorithms are explained in their structure, and data intrusion
network is justified based on an infrastructure of networks and attack types.
By conducting a meta-analysis and debating the validation of the DL and ML
approach by effectiveness, used dataset, detected attacks, classification task,
and time complexity, we offer a thorough benchmarking assessment of the current
NIDS-based publications-based systematic approach. The proposed method is
considered reviewing works for the anomaly-based network intrusion detection
system (anomaly-NIDS) models. Furthermore, the effectiveness of proposed
algorithms and selected datasets are discussed for the recent direction and
improvements of ML and DL to the NIDS. The future trends for improving an
anomaly-IDS for continuing detection in the evolution of cyberattacks are
highlighted in several research studies.

<p class="mathjax">Recent increase in wildfires worldwide has led to the need for real-time fire
nowcasting. Physics-driven models, such as cellular automata and computational
fluid dynamics can provide high-fidelity fire spread simulations but they are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. Much effort has been put into
developing machine learning models for fire prediction. However, these models
are often region-specific and require a substantial quantity of simulation data
for training purpose. This results in a significant amount of computational
effort for different ecoregions. In this work, a generative model is proposed
using a three-dimensional Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders to generate
spatial-temporal sequences of unseen wildfire burned areas in a given
ecoregion. The model is tested in the ecoregion of a recent massive wildfire
event in California, known as the Chimney fire. Numerical results show that the
model succeed in generating coherent and structured fire scenarios, taking into
account the impact from geophysical variables, such as vegetation and slope.
Generated data are also used to train a surrogate model for predicting wildfire
dissemination, which has been tested on both simulation data and the real
Chimney fire event.

<p class="mathjax">Molecular communication is a novel approach for data transmission between
miniaturized devices, especially in contexts where electrical signals are to be
avoided. The communication is based on sending molecules (or other particles)
at nano scale through channel instead sending electrons over a wire. Molecular
communication devices have a large potential in medical applications as they
offer an alternative to antenna-based transmission systems that may not be
applicable due to size, temperature, or radiation constraints. The
communication is achieved by transforming a digital signal into concentrations
of molecules. These molecules are then detected at the other end of the
communication channel and transformed back into a digital signal. Accurately
modeling the transmission channel is often not possible which may be due to a
lack of data or time-varying parameters of the channel (e. g., the movements of
a person wearing a medical device). This makes demodulation of the signal very
difficult. Many approaches for demodulation have been discussed with one
particular approach having tremendous success: artificial neural networks.
These networks imitate the decision process in the human brain and are capable
of reliably classifying noisy input data. Training such a network relies on a
large set of training data. As molecular communication as a technology is still
in its early development phase, this data is not always readily available. We
discuss neural network-based demodulation approaches relying on synthetic data
based on theoretical channel models as well as works using actual measurements
produced by a prototype test bed. In this work, we give a general overview over
the field molecular communication, discuss the challenges in the demodulations
process of transmitted signals, and present approaches to these challenges that
are based on artificial neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">Image harmonization is an essential step in image composition that adjusts
the appearance of composite foreground to address the inconsistency between
foreground and background. Existing methods primarily operate in correlated
$RGB$ color space, leading to entangled features and limited representation
ability. In contrast, decorrelated color space (e.g., $Lab$) has decorrelated
channels that provide disentangled color and illumination statistics. In this
paper, we explore image harmonization in dual color spaces, which supplements
entangled $RGB$ features with disentangled $L$, $a$, $b$ features to alleviate
the workload in harmonization process. The network comprises a $RGB$
harmonization backbone, an $Lab$ encoding module, and an $Lab$ control module.
The backbone is a U-Net network translating composite image to harmonized
image. Three encoders in $Lab$ encoding module extract three control codes
independently from $L$, $a$, $b$ channels, which are used to manipulate the
decoder features in harmonization backbone via $Lab$ control module. Our code

<p class="mathjax">A major challenge in autonomous driving is designing control architectures
that guarantee safety in all relevant driving scenarios. Given a safe desired
reference trajectory for the vehicle, a trajectory following controller has to
ensure that the trajectory is followed with a maximally allowed deviation, even
in the presence of external disturbances, such as wind gusts or inclined roads.
In this paper, a method for computing upper bounds for linear, time invariant
single-input-multiple-output systems with state feedback controllers and
additive bounded disturbances is proposed. The bounds for the offset between
states and the reference are derived analytically based on worst case
disturbance sequences. For systems with two states the bounds are strict, while
for higher order systems they are conservative. The method is applied to obtain
position bounds for lateral trajectory following controllers, and to analyze
how different choices of feedback parameters affect safety margins.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity
among the general public users over the past few months, facilitating diverse
downstream tasks with human-level accuracy and proficiency. Prompts play an
essential role in this success, which efficiently adapt pre-trained LLMs to
task-specific applications by simply prepending a sequence of tokens to the
query texts. However, designing and selecting an optimal prompt can be both
expensive and demanding, leading to the emergence of Prompt-as-a-Service
providers who profit by providing well-designed prompts for authorized use.
With the growing popularity of prompts and their indispensable role in
LLM-based services, there is an urgent need to protect the copyright of prompts
against unauthorized use.
<br />In this paper, we propose PromptCARE, the first framework for prompt
copyright protection through watermark injection and verification. Prompt
watermarking presents unique challenges that render existing watermarking
techniques developed for model and dataset copyright verification ineffective.
PromptCARE overcomes these hurdles by proposing watermark injection and
verification schemes tailor-made for prompts and NLP characteristics. Extensive
experiments on six well-known benchmark datasets, using three prevalent
pre-trained LLMs (BERT, RoBERTa, and Facebook OPT-1.3b), demonstrate the
effectiveness, harmlessness, robustness, and stealthiness of PromptCARE.

domains. These schemes lead to domains which are copious, connected, and
peak-pit. The resulting family of domains includes some of Arrow's
single-peaked domains of size $2^{n-1}$, which we prove to be the smallest
possible domains. Still, schemes of this type lead to domains larger than the
domains of Fishburn's alternating scheme. Thanks to the concise form of our
schemes, we can analyze the growth of our fastest-growing domains. We show that
the domain size for sufficiently high $n$ exceeds $2.1973^n$, improving the
previous record $2.1890^n$ from \cite{karpov2023constructing}. To perform this

<p class="mathjax">AI has made significant progress in solving math problems, but geometry
problems remain challenging due to their reliance on both text and diagrams. In
the text description, symbolic characters such as "$\triangle$ABC" often serve
as a bridge to connect the corresponding diagram. However, by simply tokenizing
symbolic characters into individual letters (e.g., 'A', 'B' and 'C'), existing
works fail to study them explicitly and thus lose the semantic relationship
with the diagram. In this paper, we develop a symbolic character-aware model to
fully explore the role of these characters in both text and diagram
understanding and optimize the model under a multi-modal reasoning framework.
In the text encoder, we propose merging individual symbolic characters to form
one semantic unit along with geometric information from the corresponding
diagram. For the diagram encoder, we pre-train it under a multi-label
classification framework with the symbolic characters as labels. In addition,
we enhance the geometry diagram understanding ability via a self-supervised
learning method under the masked image modeling auxiliary task. By integrating
the proposed model into a general encoder-decoder pipeline for solving geometry
problems, we demonstrate its superiority on two benchmark datasets, including
GeoQA and Geometry3K, with extensive experiments. Specifically, on GeoQA, the
question-solving accuracy is increased from 60.0\% to 64.1\%, achieving a new
state-of-the-art accuracy; on Geometry3K, we reduce the question average
solving steps from 6.9 down to 6.0 with marginally higher solving accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Our work presents a novel spectrum-inspired learning-based approach for
generating clothing deformations with dynamic effects and personalized details.
Existing methods in the field of clothing animation are limited to either
static behavior or specific network models for individual garments, which
hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios where diverse animated
garments are required. Our proposed method overcomes these limitations by
providing a unified framework that predicts dynamic behavior for different
garments with arbitrary topology and looseness, resulting in versatile and
realistic deformations. First, we observe that the problem of bias towards low
frequency always hampers supervised learning and leads to overly smooth
deformations. To address this issue, we introduce a frequency-control strategy
from a spectral perspective that enhances the generation of high-frequency
details of the deformation. In addition, to make the network highly
generalizable and able to learn various clothing deformations effectively, we
propose a spectral descriptor to achieve a generalized description of the
global shape information. Building on the above strategies, we develop a
dynamic clothing deformation estimator that integrates frequency-controllable
attention mechanisms with long short-term memory. The estimator takes as input
expressive features from garments and human bodies, allowing it to
automatically output continuous deformations for diverse clothing types,
independent of mesh topology or vertex count. Finally, we present a neural
collision handling method to further enhance the realism of garments. Our
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety
of free-swinging garments and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">There has been a recent explosion of research on Large Language Models (LLMs)
for software engineering tasks, in particular code generation. However, results
from LLMs can be highly unstable; nondeterministically returning very different
codes for the same prompt. Non-determinism is a potential menace to scientific
conclusion validity. When non-determinism is high, scientific conclusions
simply cannot be relied upon unless researchers change their behaviour to
control for it in their empirical analyses. This paper conducts an empirical
study to demonstrate that non-determinism is, indeed, high, thereby underlining
the need for this behavioural change. We choose to study ChatGPT because it is
already highly prevalent in the code generation research literature. We report
results from a study of 829 code generation problems from three code generation
benchmarks (i.e., CodeContests, APPS, and HumanEval). Our results reveal high
degrees of non-determinism: the ratio of coding tasks with zero equal test
output across different requests is 72.73%, 60.40%, and 65.85% for
CodeContests, APPS, and HumanEval, respectively. In addition, we find that
setting the temperature to 0 does not guarantee determinism in code generation,
although it indeed brings less non-determinism than the default configuration
(temperature=1). These results confirm that there is, currently, a significant
threat to scientific conclusion validity. In order to put LLM-based research on
firmer scientific foundations, researchers need to take into account
non-determinism in drawing their conclusions.

<p class="mathjax">Probabilistic model checking is a technique for formal automated reasoning
about software or hardware systems that operate in the context of uncertainty
or stochasticity. It builds upon ideas and techniques from a diverse range of
fields, from logic, automata and graph theory, to optimisation, numerical
methods and control. In recent years, probabilistic model checking has also
been extended to integrate ideas from game theory, notably using models such as
stochastic games and solution concepts such as equilibria, to formally verify
the interaction of multiple rational agents with distinct objectives. This
provides a means to reason flexibly about agents acting in either an
adversarial or a collaborative fashion, and opens up opportunities to tackle
new problems within, for example, artificial intelligence, robotics and
autonomous systems. In this paper, we summarise some of the advances in this
area, and highlight applications for which they have already been used. We
discuss how the strengths of probabilistic model checking apply, or have the
potential to apply, to the multi-agent setting and outline some of the key
challenges required to make further progress in this field.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, more and more researchers have reflected on the
undervaluation of emotion in data visualization and highlighted the importance
of considering human emotion in visualization design. Meanwhile, an increasing
number of studies have been conducted to explore emotion-related factors.
However, so far, this research area is still in its early stages and faces a
set of challenges, such as the unclear definition of key concepts, the
insufficient justification of why emotion is important in visualization design,
and the lack of characterization of the design space of affective visualization
design. To address these challenges, first, we conducted a literature review
and identified three research lines that examined both emotion and data
visualization. We clarified the differences between these research lines and
kept 109 papers that studied or discussed how data visualization communicates
and influences emotion. Then, we coded the 109 papers in terms of how they
justified the legitimacy of considering emotion in visualization design (i.e.,
why emotion is important) and identified five argumentative perspectives. Based
on these papers, we also identified 61 projects that practiced affective
visualization design. We coded these design projects in three dimensions,
including design fields (where), design tasks (what), and design methods (how),
to explore the design space of affective visualization design.

<p class="mathjax">Image captioning is a computer vision task that involves generating natural
language descriptions for images. This method has numerous applications in
various domains, including image retrieval systems, medicine, and various
industries. However, while there has been significant research in image
captioning, most studies have focused on high quality images or controlled
environments, without exploring the challenges of real-world image captioning.
Real-world image captioning involves complex and dynamic environments with
numerous points of attention, with images which are often very poor in quality,
making it a challenging task, even for humans. This paper evaluates the
performance of various models that are built on top of different encoding
mechanisms, language decoders and training procedures using a newly created
real-world dataset that consists of over 800+ images of over 65 different scene
classes, built using MIT Indoor scenes dataset. This dataset is captioned using
the IC3 approach that generates more descriptive captions by summarizing the
details that are covered by standard image captioning models from unique
view-points of the image.

<p class="mathjax">The number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, especially
latency-sensitive ones, have been significantly increased. So, Cloud computing,
as one of the main enablers of the IoT that offers centralized services, cannot
solely satisfy the requirements of IoT applications. Edge/Fog computing, as a
distributed computing paradigm, processes, and stores IoT data at the edge of
the network, offering low latency, reduced network traffic, and higher
bandwidth. The Edge/Fog resources are often less powerful compared to Cloud,
and IoT data is dispersed among many geo-distributed servers. Hence, Federated
Learning (FL), which is a machine learning approach that enables multiple
distributed servers to collaborate on building models without exchanging the
raw data, is well-suited to Edge/Fog computing environments, where data privacy
is of paramount importance. Besides, to manage different FL tasks on Edge/Fog
computing environments, a lightweight resource management framework is required
to manage different incoming FL tasks while does not incur significant overhead
on the system. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a lightweight FL
framework, called FLight, to be deployed on a diverse range of devices, ranging
from resource limited Edge/Fog devices to powerful Cloud servers. FLight is
implemented based on the FogBus2 framework, which is a containerized
distributed resource management framework. Moreover, FLight integrates both
synchronous and asynchronous models of FL. Besides, we propose a lightweight
heuristic-based worker selection algorithm to select a suitable set of
available workers to participate in the training step to obtain higher training
time efficiency. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the FLight.

<p class="mathjax">Performing tasks in a physical environment is a crucial yet challenging
problem for AI systems operating in the real world. Physics simulation-based
tasks are often employed to facilitate research that addresses this challenge.
In this paper, first, we present a systematic approach for defining a physical
scenario using a causal sequence of physical interactions between objects.
Then, we propose a methodology for generating tasks in a physics-simulating
environment using these defined scenarios as inputs. Our approach enables a
better understanding of the granular mechanics required for solving
physics-based tasks, thereby facilitating accurate evaluation of AI systems'
physical reasoning capabilities. We demonstrate our proposed task generation
methodology using the physics-based puzzle game Angry Birds and evaluate the
generated tasks using a range of metrics, including physical stability,
solvability using intended physical interactions, and accidental solvability
using unintended solutions. We believe that the tasks generated using our
proposed methodology can facilitate a nuanced evaluation of physical reasoning
agents, thus paving the way for the development of agents for more
sophisticated real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate to what extent it is possible to solve linear inverse problems
with $ReLu$ networks. Due to the scaling invariance arising from the linearity,
an optimal reconstruction function $f$ for such a problem is positive
homogeneous, i.e., satisfies $f(\lambda x) = \lambda f(x)$ for all non-negative
$\lambda$. In a $ReLu$ network, this condition translates to considering
networks without bias terms. We first consider recovery of sparse vectors from
few linear measurements. We prove that $ReLu$- networks with only one hidden
layer cannot even recover $1$-sparse vectors, not even approximately, and
regardless of the width of the network. However, with two hidden layers,
approximate recovery with arbitrary precision and arbitrary sparsity level $s$
is possible in a stable way. We then extend our results to a wider class of
recovery problems including low-rank matrix recovery and phase retrieval.
Furthermore, we also consider the approximation of general positive homogeneous
functions with neural networks. Extending previous work, we establish new
results explaining under which conditions such functions can be approximated
with neural networks. Our results also shed some light on the seeming
contradiction between previous works showing that neural networks for inverse
problems typically have very large Lipschitz constants, but still perform very
well also for adversarial noise. Namely, the error bounds in our expressivity
results include a combination of a small constant term and a term that is
linear in the noise level, indicating that robustness issues may occur only for
very small noise levels.

<p class="mathjax">At its core, feather was a tool that allowed model developers to build
shareable user interfaces for their models in under 20 lines of code. Using the
Python SDK, developers specified visual components that users would interact
with. (e.g. a FileUpload component to allow users to upload a file). Our
service then provided 1) a URL that allowed others to access and use the model
visually via a user interface; 2) an API endpoint to allow programmatic
requests to a model. In this paper, we discuss feather's motivations and the
value we intended to offer AI researchers and developers. For example, the SDK
can support multi-step models and can be extended to run automatic evaluation
against held out datasets. We additionally provide comprehensive technical and
implementation details.

<p class="mathjax">Implicit neural representations have shown powerful capacity in modeling
real-world 3D scenes, offering superior performance in novel view synthesis. In
this paper, we target a more challenging scenario, i.e., joint scene novel view
synthesis and editing based on implicit neural scene representations.
State-of-the-art methods in this direction typically consider building separate
networks for these two tasks (i.e., view synthesis and editing). Thus, the
modeling of interactions and correlations between these two tasks is very
limited, which, however, is critical for learning high-quality scene
representations. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a unified
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework to effectively perform joint scene
decomposition and composition for modeling real-world scenes. The decomposition
aims at learning disentangled 3D representations of different objects and the
background, allowing for scene editing, while scene composition models an
entire scene representation for novel view synthesis. Specifically, with a
two-stage NeRF framework, we learn a coarse stage for predicting a global
radiance field as guidance for point sampling, and in the second fine-grained
stage, we perform scene decomposition by a novel one-hot object radiance field
regularization module and a pseudo supervision via inpainting to handle
ambiguous background regions occluded by objects. The decomposed object-level
radiance fields are further composed by using activations from the
decomposition module. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results show the
effectiveness of our method for scene decomposition and composition,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods for both novel-view synthesis and
editing tasks.

<p class="mathjax">When developing and managing microservice systems, practitioners suggest that
each microservice should be owned by a particular team. In effect, there is
only one team with the responsibility to manage a given service. Consequently,
one developer should belong to only one team. This practice of
"one-microservice-per-developer" is especially prevalent in large projects with
an extensive development team. Based on the bazaar-style software development
model of Open Source Projects, in which different programmers, like vendors at
a bazaar, offer to help out developing different parts of the system, this
article investigates whether we can observe the
"one-microservice-per-developer" behavior, a strategy we assume anticipated
within microservice based Open Source Projects. We conducted an empirical study
among 38 microservice-based OS projects. Our findings indicate that the
strategy is rarely respected by open-source developers except for projects that
have dedicated DevOps teams.

<p class="mathjax">We study a particular matching task we call Music Cold-Start Matching. In
short, given a cold-start song request, we expect to retrieve songs with
similar audiences and then fastly push the cold-start song to the audiences of
the retrieved songs to warm up it. However, there are hardly any studies done
on this task. Therefore, in this paper, we will formalize the problem of Music
Cold-Start Matching detailedly and give a scheme. During the offline training,
we attempt to learn high-quality song representations based on song content
features. But, we find supervision signals typically follow power-law
distribution causing skewed representation learning. To address this issue, we
propose a novel contrastive learning paradigm named Bootstrapping Contrastive
Learning (BCL) to enhance the quality of learned representations by exerting
contrastive regularization. During the online serving, to locate the target
audiences more accurately, we propose Clustering-based Audience Targeting (CAT)
that clusters audience representations to acquire a few cluster centroids and
then locate the target audiences by measuring the relevance between the
audience representations and the cluster centroids. Extensive experiments on
the offline dataset and online system demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our method. Currently, we have deployed it on NetEase Cloud
Music, affecting millions of users. Code will be released in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Learning-to-rank is a core technique in the top-N recommendation task, where
an ideal ranker would be a mapping from an item set to an arrangement (a.k.a.
permutation). Most existing solutions fall in the paradigm of probabilistic
ranking principle (PRP), i.e., first score each item in the candidate set and
then perform a sort operation to generate the top ranking list. However, these
approaches neglect the contextual dependence among candidate items during
individual scoring, and the sort operation is non-differentiable. To bypass the
above issues, we propose Set-To-Arrangement Ranking (STARank), a new framework
directly generates the permutations of the candidate items without the need for
individually scoring and sort operations; and is end-to-end differentiable. As
a result, STARank can operate when only the ground-truth permutations are
accessible without requiring access to the ground-truth relevance scores for
items. For this purpose, STARank first reads the candidate items in the context
of the user browsing history, whose representations are fed into a
Plackett-Luce module to arrange the given items into a list. To effectively
utilize the given ground-truth permutations for supervising STARank, we
leverage the internal consistency property of Plackett-Luce models to derive a
computationally efficient list-wise loss. Experimental comparisons against 9
the state-of-the-art methods on 2 learning-to-rank benchmark datasets and 3
top-N real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate the superiority of STARank
in terms of conventional ranking metrics. Notice that these ranking metrics do
not consider the effects of the contextual dependence among the items in the
list, we design a new family of simulation-based ranking metrics, where
existing metrics can be regarded as special cases. STARank can consistently
achieve better performance in terms of PBM and UBM simulation-based metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Pretrained visual-language models have demonstrated impressive zero-shot
abilities in image captioning, when accompanied by hand-crafted prompts.
Meanwhile, hand-crafted prompts utilize human prior knowledge to guide the
model. However, due to the diversity between different domains, such
hand-crafted prompt that provide invariant prior knowledge may result in mode
collapse for some domains. Some researches attempted to incorporate expert
knowledge and instruction datasets, but the results were costly and led to
hallucinations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised prompt learning
method to improve Generalization of Image Captioning (GeneIC), which learns a
domain-specific prompt vector for the target domain without requiring annotated
data. GeneIC aligns visual and language modalities with a pre-trained
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, thus optimizing the
domain-specific prompt vector from two aspects: attribute and semantic
consistency. Specifically, GeneIC first generates attribute-transferred images
with differing attributes, while retaining semantic similarity with original
images. Then, GeneIC uses CLIP to measure the similarity between the images and
the generated sentences. By exploring the variable and invariant features in
the original images and attribute-transferred images, attribute consistency
constrains the attribute change direction of both images and sentences to learn
domain-specific knowledge. The semantic consistency directly measures the
similarity between the generated sentences and images to ensure the accuracy
and comprehensiveness of the generated sentences. Consequently, GeneIC only
optimizes the prompt vectors, which effectively retains the knowledge in the
large model and introduces domain-specific knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised semantic segmentation involves assigning pixel-wise labels to
unlabeled images at training time. This is useful in a wide range of real-world
applications where collecting pixel-wise labels is not feasible in time or
cost. Current approaches to semi-supervised semantic segmentation work by
predicting pseudo-labels for each pixel from a class-wise probability
distribution output by a model. If the predicted probability distribution is
incorrect, however, this leads to poor segmentation results, which can have
knock-on consequences in safety critical systems, like medical images or
self-driving cars. It is, therefore, important to understand what a model does
not know, which is mainly achieved by uncertainty quantification. Recently,
neural processes (NPs) have been explored in semi-supervised image
classification, and they have been a computationally efficient and effective
method for uncertainty quantification. In this work, we move one step forward
by adapting NPs to semi-supervised semantic segmentation, resulting in a new
model called NP-SemiSeg. We experimentally evaluated NP-SemiSeg on the public
benchmarks PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, with different training settings,
and the results verify its effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">There has been a growing interest in using end-to-end acoustic models for
singing voice synthesis (SVS). Typically, these models require an additional
vocoder to transform the generated acoustic features into the final waveform.
However, since the acoustic model and the vocoder are not jointly optimized, a
gap can exist between the two models, leading to suboptimal performance.
Although a similar problem has been addressed in the TTS systems by
joint-training or by replacing acoustic features with a latent representation,
adopting corresponding approaches to SVS is not an easy task. How to improve
the joint-training of SVS systems has not been well explored. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation of how to better perform a joint-training of
an acoustic model and a vocoder for SVS. We carry out extensive experiments and
demonstrate that our joint-training strategy outperforms baselines, achieving
more stable performance across different datasets while also increasing the
interpretability of the entire framework.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of modern diagnostic technology, video capsule endoscopy (VCE)
is a standout for its high efficacy and non-invasive nature in diagnosing
various gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, including obscure bleeding.
Importantly, for the successful diagnosis and treatment of these conditions,
accurate recognition of bleeding regions in VCE images is crucial. While deep
learning-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for the automated
analysis of VCE images, they often demand large training datasets with
comprehensive annotations. Acquiring these labeled datasets tends to be
time-consuming, costly, and requires significant domain expertise. To mitigate
this issue, we have embraced a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach for the
bleeding regions segmentation within VCE. By adopting the `Mean Teacher'
method, we construct a student U-Net equipped with an scSE attention block,
alongside a teacher model of the same architecture. These models' parameters
are alternately updated throughout the training process. We use the
Kvasir-Capsule dataset for our experiments, which encompasses various GI
bleeding conditions. Notably, we develop the segmentation annotations for this
dataset ourselves. The findings from our experiments endorse the efficacy of
the SSL-based segmentation strategy, demonstrating its capacity to reduce
reliance on large volumes of annotations for model training, without
compromising on the accuracy of identification.

<p class="mathjax">The conventional recipe for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models is to
1) train multiple checkpoints on a training set while relying on a validation
set to prevent overfitting using early stopping and 2) average several last
checkpoints or that of the lowest validation losses to obtain the final model.
In this paper, we rethink and update the early stopping and checkpoint
averaging from the perspective of the bias-variance tradeoff. Theoretically,
the bias and variance represent the fitness and variability of a model and the
tradeoff of them determines the overall generalization error. But, it's
impractical to evaluate them precisely. As an alternative, we take the training
loss and validation loss as proxies of bias and variance and guide the early
stopping and checkpoint averaging using their tradeoff, namely an Approximated
Bias-Variance Tradeoff (ApproBiVT). When evaluating with advanced ASR models,
our recipe provides 2.5%-3.7% and 3.1%-4.6% CER reduction on the AISHELL-1 and
AISHELL-2, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This paper deals with the problem of inferential (soft) sensor design. The
nonlinear character of industrial processes is usually the main limitation to
designing simple linear inferential sensors with sufficient accuracy. In order
to increase the inferential sensor predictive performance and yet to maintain
its linear structure, multi-model inferential sensors represent a
straightforward option. In this contribution, we propose two novel approaches
for the design of multi-model inferential sensors aiming to mitigate some
drawbacks of the state-of-the-art approaches. For a demonstration of the
developed techniques, we design inferential sensors for a Vacuum Gasoil
Hydrogenation unit, which is a real-world petrochemical refinery unit. The
performance of the multi-model inferential sensor is compared against various
single-model inferential sensors and the current (referential) inferential
sensor used in the refinery. The results show substantial improvements over the
state-of-the-art design techniques for single-/multi-model inferential sensors.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in text
guided image generation. However, generating 3D shapes is still challenging due
to the lack of sufficient data containing 3D models along with their
descriptions. Moreover, text based descriptions of 3D shapes are inherently
ambiguous and lack details. In this paper, we propose a sketch and text guided
probabilistic diffusion model for colored point cloud generation that
conditions the denoising process jointly with a hand drawn sketch of the object
and its textual description. We incrementally diffuse the point coordinates and
color values in a joint diffusion process to reach a Gaussian distribution.
Colored point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion
process, conditioned by the sketch and text, to iteratively recover the desired
shape and color. Specifically, to learn effective sketch-text embedding, our
model adaptively aggregates the joint embedding of text prompt and the sketch
based on a capsule attention network. Our model uses staged diffusion to
generate the shape and then assign colors to different parts conditioned on the
appearance prompt while preserving precise shapes from the first stage. This
gives our model the flexibility to extend to multiple tasks, such as appearance
re-editing and part segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms recent state-of-the-art in point cloud generation.

improving the model's capabilities by employing prior knowledge and experience.
A meta-learning paradigm can appropriately tackle the conventional challenges
of traditional learning approaches, such as insufficient number of samples,
domain shifts, and generalization. These unique characteristics position
meta-learning as a suitable choice for developing influential solutions in
various healthcare contexts, where the available data is often insufficient,
and the data collection methodologies are different. This survey discusses
meta-learning broad applications in the healthcare domain to provide insight
into how and where it can address critical healthcare challenges. We first
describe the theoretical foundations and pivotal methods of meta-learning. We
then divide the employed meta-learning approaches in the healthcare domain into
two main categories of multi/single-task learning and many/few-shot learning
and survey the studies. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in
meta-learning research, discuss the potential solutions and provide future
perspectives on meta-learning in healthcare.

<p class="mathjax">Sensitive applications running on the cloud often require data to be stored
in an encrypted domain. To run data mining algorithms on such data, partially
homomorphic encryption schemes (allowing certain operations in the ciphertext
domain) have been devised. One such line of work yields schemes for secure
\textit{k-nearest neighbors} computation that is designed to provide both
\textit{Data Privacy} and \textit{Query Privacy}. Enhancements in this area
further ensure that the data owner approves each query issued by a query user
before the cloud server processes it. In this work, we describe an attack that
invalidates the \textit{key confidentiality} claim, which further invalidates
the \textit{Data Privacy} claim for these schemes. We show that a query user
can specially tailor a query to extract information about the secret key used
to encrypt the data points. Furthermore, the recovered secret information can
be used to derive all the plaintext data points breaking \textit{data privacy}.
We then suggest enhanced encryption schemes that make such attacks on
\textit{data privacy} impossible while incurring meager additional costs in
performance.

lower and upper bounds on the optimal number of validators. More concretely, a
minimal feasible number of validators minimizes the probability of failure. The
framework also allows to calculate optimum stake sizes, depending on the target
function. In the end, we discuss optimal design of rewards by the protocol for
validators.

<p class="mathjax">To further preserve model weight privacy and improve model performance in
Federated Learning (FL), FL via Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp) scheme based
on dynamic power control is proposed. The edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs
of local stochastic gradients by activating two adjacent orthogonal frequency
division multi-plexing (OFDM) subcarriers, and majority votes (MVs) at the edge
server (ES) are obtained by exploiting the energy accumulation on the
subcarriers. Then, we propose a dynamic power control algorithm to further
offset the biased aggregation of the MV aggregation values. We show that the
whole scheme can mitigate the impact of the time synchronization error, channel
fading and noise. The theoretical convergence proof of the scheme is
re-derived.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, cross-modal domain adaptation has been studied on the paired
2D image and 3D LiDAR data to ease the labeling costs for 3D LiDAR semantic
segmentation (3DLSS) in the target domain. However, in such a setting the
paired 2D and 3D data in the source domain are still collected with additional
effort. Since the 2D-3D projections can enable the 3D model to learn semantic
information from the 2D counterpart, we ask whether we could further remove the
need of source 3D data and only rely on the source 2D images. To answer it,
this paper studies a new 3DLSS setting where a 2D dataset (source) with
semantic annotations and a paired but unannotated 2D image and 3D LiDAR data
(target) are available. To achieve 3DLSS in this scenario, we propose
Cross-Modal and Cross-Domain Learning (CoMoDaL). Specifically, our CoMoDaL aims
at modeling 1) inter-modal cross-domain distillation between the unpaired
source 2D image and target 3D LiDAR data, and 2) the intra-domain cross-modal
guidance between the target 2D image and 3D LiDAR data pair. In CoMoDaL, we
propose to apply several constraints, such as point-to-pixel and
prototype-to-pixel alignments, to associate the semantics in different
modalities and domains by constructing mixed samples in two modalities. The
experimental results on several datasets show that in the proposed setting, the
developed CoMoDaL can achieve segmentation without the supervision of labeled
LiDAR data. Ablations are also conducted to provide more analysis. Code will be
available publicly.

<p class="mathjax">Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has emerged as a promising technology for
processing encrypted data without the need for decryption. Despite its
potential, its practical implementation has faced challenges due to substantial
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the $first$
chiplet-based FHE accelerator design `REED', which enables scalability and
offers high throughput, thereby enhancing homomorphic encryption deployment in
real-world scenarios. It incorporates well-known wafer yield issues during
fabrication which significantly impacts production costs. In contrast to
state-of-the-art approaches, we also address data exchange overhead by
proposing a non-blocking inter-chiplet communication strategy. We incorporate
novel pipelined Number Theoretic Transform and automorphism techniques,
leveraging parallelism and providing high throughput.
<br />Experimental results demonstrate that REED 2.5D integrated circuit consumes
177 mm$^2$ chip area, 82.5 W average power in 7nm technology, and achieves an
impressive speedup of up to 5,982$\times$ compared to a CPU (24-core
2$\times$Intel X5690), and 2$\times$ better energy efficiency and 50\% lower
development cost than state-of-the-art ASIC accelerator. To evaluate its
practical impact, we are the $first$ to benchmark an encrypted deep neural
network training. Overall, this work successfully enhances the practicality and
deployability of fully homomorphic encryption in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">When learning to rank from user interactions, search and recommendation
systems must address biases in user behavior to provide a high-quality ranking.
One type of bias that has recently been studied in the ranking literature is
when sensitive attributes, such as gender, have an impact on a user's judgment
about an item's utility. For example, in a search for an expertise area, some
users may be biased towards clicking on male candidates over female candidates.
We call this type of bias group membership bias or group bias for short.
Increasingly, we seek rankings that not only have high utility but are also
fair to individuals and sensitive groups. Merit-based fairness measures rely on
the estimated merit or utility of the items. With group bias, the utility of
the sensitive groups is under-estimated, hence, without correcting for this
bias, a supposedly fair ranking is not truly fair. In this paper, first, we
analyze the impact of group bias on ranking quality as well as two well-known
merit-based fairness metrics and show that group bias can hurt both ranking and
fairness. Then, we provide a correction method for group bias that is based on
the assumption that the utility score of items in different groups comes from
the same distribution. This assumption has two potential issues of sparsity and
equality-instead-of-equity, which we use an amortized approach to solve. We
show that our correction method can consistently compensate for the negative
impact of group bias on ranking quality and fairness metrics.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a generalization of deep learning-aided joint source channel
coding (Deep-JSCC) approach to secure communications is studied. We propose an
end-to-end (E2E) learning-based approach for secure communication against
multiple eavesdroppers over complex-valued fading channels. Both scenarios of
colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers are studied. For the colluding
strategy, eavesdroppers share their logits to collaboratively infer private
attributes based on ensemble learning method, while for the non-colluding setup
they act alone. The goal is to prevent eavesdroppers from inferring private
(sensitive) information about the transmitted images, while delivering the
images to a legitimate receiver with minimum distortion. By generalizing the
ideas of privacy funnel and wiretap channel coding, the trade-off between the
image recovery at the legitimate node and the information leakage to the
eavesdroppers is characterized. To solve this secrecy funnel framework, we
implement deep neural networks (DNNs) to realize a data-driven secure
communication scheme, without relying on a specific data distribution.
Simulations over CIFAR-10 dataset verifies the secrecy-utility trade-off.
Adversarial accuracy of eavesdroppers are also studied over Rayleigh fading,
Nakagami-m, and AWGN channels to verify the generalization of the proposed
scheme. Our experiments show that employing the proposed secure neural encoding
can decrease the adversarial accuracy by 28%.

<p class="mathjax">Modern datacenter applications are prone to high tail latencies since their
requests typically follow highly-dispersive distributions. Delivering fast
interrupts is essential to reducing tail latency. Prior work has proposed both
OS- and system-level solutions to reduce tail latencies for microsecond-scale
workloads through better scheduling. Unfortunately, existing approaches like
customized dataplane OSes, require significant OS changes, experience
scalability limitations, or do not reach the full performance capabilities
hardware offers.
<br />The emergence of new hardware features like UINTR exposed new opportunities
to rethink the design paradigms and abstractions of traditional scheduling
systems. We propose LibPreemptible, a preemptive user-level threading library
that is flexible, lightweight, and adaptive. LibPreemptible was built with a
set of optimizations like LibUtimer for scalability, and deadline-oriented API
for flexible policies, time-quantum controller for adaptiveness. Compared to
the prior state-of-the-art scheduling system Shinjuku, our system achieves
significant tail latency and throughput improvements for various workloads
without modifying the kernel. We also demonstrate the flexibility of
LibPreemptible across scheduling policies for real applications experiencing
varying load levels and characteristics.

<p class="mathjax">While the transferability property of adversarial examples allows the
adversary to perform black-box attacks (i.e., the attacker has no knowledge
about the target model), the transfer-based adversarial attacks have gained
great attention. Previous works mostly study gradient variation or image
transformations to amplify the distortion on critical parts of inputs. These
methods can work on transferring across models with limited differences, i.e.,
from CNNs to CNNs, but always fail in transferring across models with wide
differences, such as from CNNs to ViTs. Alternatively, model ensemble
adversarial attacks are proposed to fuse outputs from surrogate models with
diverse architectures to get an ensemble loss, making the generated adversarial
example more likely to transfer to other models as it can fool multiple models
concurrently. However, existing ensemble attacks simply fuse the outputs of the
surrogate models evenly, thus are not efficacious to capture and amplify the
intrinsic transfer information of adversarial examples. In this paper, we
propose an adaptive ensemble attack, dubbed AdaEA, to adaptively control the
fusion of the outputs from each model, via monitoring the discrepancy ratio of
their contributions towards the adversarial objective. Furthermore, an extra
disparity-reduced filter is introduced to further synchronize the update
direction. As a result, we achieve considerable improvement over the existing
ensemble attacks on various datasets, and the proposed AdaEA can also boost
existing transfer-based attacks, which further demonstrates its efficacy and
versatility.

<p class="mathjax">It is widely known that males and females typically possess different sound
characteristics when singing, such as timbre and pitch, but it has never been
explored whether these gender-based characteristics lead to a performance
disparity in singing voice transcription (SVT), whose target includes pitch.
Such a disparity could cause fairness issues and severely affect the user
experience of downstream SVT applications. Motivated by this, we first
demonstrate the female superiority of SVT systems, which is observed across
different models and datasets. We find that different pitch distributions,
rather than gender data imbalance, contribute to this disparity. To address
this issue, we propose using an attribute predictor to predict gender labels
and adversarially training the SVT system to enforce the gender-invariance of
acoustic representations. Leveraging the prior knowledge that pitch
distributions may contribute to the gender bias, we propose conditionally
aligning acoustic representations between demographic groups by feeding note
events to the attribute predictor. Empirical experiments on multiple benchmark
SVT datasets show that our method significantly reduces gender bias (up to more
than 50%) with negligible degradation of overall SVT performance, on both
in-domain and out-of-domain singing data, thus offering a better
fairness-utility trade-off.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential recommender systems have achieved state-of-the-art recommendation
performance by modeling the sequential dynamics of user activities. However, in
most recommendation scenarios, the popular items comprise the major part of the
previous user actions. Therefore, the learned models are biased towards the
popular items irrespective of the user's real interests. In this paper, we
propose a structural causal model-based method to address the popularity bias
issue for sequential recommendation model learning. For more generalizable
modeling, we disentangle the popularity and interest representations at both
the item side and user context side. Based on the disentangled representation,
we identify a more effective structural causal graph for general recommendation
applications. Then, we design delicate sequential models to apply the
aforementioned causal graph to the sequential recommendation scenario for
unbiased prediction with counterfactual reasoning. Furthermore, we conduct
extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests to verify the proposed
\textbf{DCR} (Disentangled Counterfactual Reasoning) method's superior overall
performance and understand the effectiveness of the various introduced
components. Based on our knowledge, this is the first structural causal model
specifically designed for the popularity bias correction of sequential
recommendation models, which achieves significant performance gains over the
existing methods.

with activation costs $\{c_{e}^u,c_{e}^v\}$ for every edge $e=uv \in E$, and
degree requirements $r=\{r_v:v \in V\}$. The goal is to find an edge subset $J

the maximum quotient between the two costs of an edge. For $\theta=1$ the
problem admits approximation ratio $O(\log k)$. For $k=1$ it generalizes the
Set Cover problem (when $\theta=\infty$), and admits a tight approximation
ratio $O(\log n)$. This implies approximation ratio $O(k \log n)$ for general
$k$ and $\theta$, and no better approximation ratio was known. We obtain the

bridges between the two known ratios -- $O(\log k)$ for $\theta=1$ and $O(\log
n)$ for $k=1$. This implies approximation ratio $O\left(\log k
+\log\min\{\theta,n\}\right) +\beta \cdot (\theta+1)$ for the Activation
$k$-Connected Subgraph problem, where $\beta$ is the best known approximation
ratio for the ordinary min-cost version of the problem.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a new Reservoir Computing (RC) architecture, called
the Edge of Stability Echo State Network (ES$^2$N). The introduced ES$^2$N
model is based on defining the reservoir layer as a convex combination of a
nonlinear reservoir (as in the standard ESN), and a linear reservoir that
implements an orthogonal transformation. We provide a thorough mathematical
analysis of the introduced model, proving that the whole eigenspectrum of the
Jacobian of the ES2N map can be contained in an annular neighbourhood of a
complex circle of controllable radius, and exploit this property to demonstrate
that the ES$^2$N's forward dynamics evolves close to the edge-of-chaos regime
by design. Remarkably, our experimental analysis shows that the newly
introduced reservoir model is able to reach the theoretical maximum short-term
memory capacity. At the same time, in comparison to standard ESN, ES$^2$N is
shown to offer a favorable trade-off between memory and nonlinearity, as well
as a significant improvement of performance in autoregressive nonlinear
modeling.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-lingual adaptation has proven effective in spoken language
understanding (SLU) systems with limited resources. Existing methods are
frequently unsatisfactory for intent detection and slot filling, particularly
for distant languages that differ significantly from the source language in
scripts, morphology, and syntax. Latent Dialogue Action (LaDA) layer is
proposed to optimize decoding strategy in order to address the aforementioned
issues. The model consists of an additional layer of latent dialogue action. It
enables our model to improve a system's capability of handling conversations
with complex multilingual intent and slot values of distant languages. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first exhaustive investigation of the use of
latent variables for optimizing cross-lingual SLU policy during the decode
stage. LaDA obtains state-of-the-art results on public datasets for both
zero-shot and few-shot adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">Particle methods based on evolving the spatial derivatives of the solution
were originally introduced to simulate reaction-diffusion processes, inspired
by vortex methods for the Navier--Stokes equations. Such methods, referred to
as gradient random walk methods, were extensively studied in the '90s and have
several interesting features, such as being grid free, automatically adapting
to the solution by concentrating elements where the gradient is large and
significantly reducing the variance of the standard random walk approach. In
this work, we revive these ideas by showing how to generalize the approach to a
larger class of partial differential equations, including hyperbolic systems of
conservation laws. To achieve this goal, we first extend the classical Monte
Carlo method to relaxation approximation of systems of conservation laws, and
subsequently consider a novel particle dynamics based on the spatial
derivatives of the solution. The methodology, combined with
asymptotic-preserving splitting discretization, yields a way to construct a new
class of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods for hyperbolic systems of
conservation laws. Several results in one spatial dimension for scalar
equations and systems of conservation laws show that the new methods are very
promising and yield remarkable improvements compared to standard Monte Carlo
approaches, either in terms of variance reduction as well as in describing the
shock structure.

<p class="mathjax">Scene Text Editing (STE) is a challenging research problem, and it aims to
modify existing texts in an image while preserving the background and the font
style of the original text of the image. Due to its various real-life
applications, researchers have explored several approaches toward STE in recent
years. However, most of the existing STE methods show inferior editing
performance because of (1) complex image backgrounds, (2) various font styles,
and (3) varying word lengths within the text. To address such inferior editing
performance issues, in this paper, we propose a novel font-agnostic scene text
editing framework, named FAST, for simultaneously generating text in arbitrary
styles and locations while preserving a natural and realistic appearance
through combined mask generation and style transfer. The proposed approach
differs from the existing methods as they directly modify all image pixels.
Instead, the proposed method has introduced a filtering mechanism to remove
background distractions, allowing the network to focus solely on the text
regions where editing is required. Additionally, a text-style transfer module
has been designed to mitigate the challenges posed by varying word lengths.
Extensive experiments and ablations have been conducted, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Separation logic is used to reason locally about stateful programs. State of
the art program logics for higher-order store are usually built on top of
untyped operational semantics, in part because traditional denotational methods
have struggled to simultaneously account for general references and parametric
polymorphism. The recent discovery of simple denotational semantics for general
references and polymorphism in synthetic guarded domain theory has enabled us
to develop TULIP, a higher-order separation logic over the typed equational
theory of higher-order store for a monadic version of System F{mu,ref}. The
Tulip logic differs from operationally-based program logics in two ways:
predicates range over the meanings of typed terms rather than over the raw code
of untyped terms, and they are automatically invariant under the equational
congruence of higher-order store, which applies even underneath a binder. As a
result, "pure" proof steps that conventionally require focusing the Hoare
triple on an operational redex are replaced by a simple equational rewrite in
Tulip. We have evaluated Tulip against standard examples involving linked lists
in the heap, comparing our abstract equational reasoning with more familiar
operational-style reasoning. Our main result is the soundness of Tulip, which
we establish by constructing a BI-hyperdoctrine over the denotational semantics
of F{mu,ref} in an impredicative version of synthetic guarded domain theory.

<p class="mathjax">Humanitarian organizations provide aid to people in need. To use their
limited budget efficiently, their distribution processes must ensure that
legitimate recipients cannot receive more aid than they are entitled to. Thus,
it is essential that recipients can register at most once per aid program.
Taking the International Committee of the Red Cross's aid distribution
registration process as a use case, we identify the requirements to detect
double registration without creating new risks for aid recipients. We then
design Janus, which combines privacy-enhancing technologies with biometrics to
prevent double registration in a safe manner. Janus does not create plaintext
biometric databases and reveals only one bit of information at registration
time (whether the user registering is present in the database or not). We
implement and evaluate three instantiations of Janus based on secure multiparty
computation, somewhat homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution
environments. We demonstrate that they support the privacy, accuracy, and
performance needs of humanitarian organizations. We compare Janus with existing
alternatives and show it is the first system that provides the accuracy our
scenario requires while providing strong protection.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Fields from Sparse input} (NeRF-S) have shown great potential
in synthesizing novel views with a limited number of observed viewpoints.
However, due to the inherent limitations of sparse inputs and the gap between
non-adjacent views, rendering results often suffer from over-fitting and foggy
surfaces, a phenomenon we refer to as "CONFUSION" during volume rendering. In
this paper, we analyze the root cause of this confusion and attribute it to two
fundamental questions: "WHERE" and "HOW". To this end, we present a novel
learning framework, WaH-NeRF, which effectively mitigates confusion by tackling
the following challenges: (i)"WHERE" to Sample? in NeRF-S -- we introduce a
Deformable Sampling strategy and a Weight-based Mutual Information Loss to
address sample-position confusion arising from the limited number of
viewpoints; and (ii) "HOW" to Predict? in NeRF-S -- we propose a
Semi-Supervised NeRF learning Paradigm based on pose perturbation and a
Pixel-Patch Correspondence Loss to alleviate prediction confusion caused by the
disparity between training and testing viewpoints. By integrating our proposed
modules and loss functions, WaH-NeRF outperforms previous methods under the
NeRF-S setting. Code is available https://github.com/bbbbby-99/WaH-NeRF.

<p class="mathjax">When hearing music, it is natural for people to dance to its rhythm.
Automatic dance generation, however, is a challenging task due to the physical
constraints of human motion and rhythmic alignment with target music.
Conventional autoregressive methods introduce compounding errors during
sampling and struggle to capture the long-term structure of dance sequences. To
address these limitations, we present a novel cascaded motion diffusion model,
DiffDance, designed for high-resolution, long-form dance generation. This model
comprises a music-to-dance diffusion model and a sequence super-resolution
diffusion model. To bridge the gap between music and motion for conditional
generation, DiffDance employs a pretrained audio representation learning model
to extract music embeddings and further align its embedding space to motion via
contrastive loss. During training our cascaded diffusion model, we also
incorporate multiple geometric losses to constrain the model outputs to be
physically plausible and add a dynamic loss weight that adaptively changes over
diffusion timesteps to facilitate sample diversity. Through comprehensive
experiments performed on the benchmark dataset AIST++, we demonstrate that
DiffDance is capable of generating realistic dance sequences that align
effectively with the input music. These results are comparable to those
achieved by state-of-the-art autoregressive methods.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT), a combination of core subgraph and sparse
subnetwork, has been proposed to mitigate the computational cost of deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) on large input graphs while preserving original
performance. However, the winning GLTs in exisiting studies are obtained by
applying iterative magnitude-based pruning (IMP) without re-evaluating and
re-considering the pruned information, which disregards the dynamic changes in
the significance of edges/weights during graph/model structure pruning, and
thus limits the appeal of the winning tickets. In this paper, we formulate a
conjecture, i.e., existing overlooked valuable information in the pruned graph
connections and model parameters which can be re-grouped into GLT to enhance
the final performance. Specifically, we propose an adversarial complementary
erasing (ACE) framework to explore the valuable information from the pruned
components, thereby developing a more powerful GLT, referred to as the ACE-GLT.
The main idea is to mine valuable information from pruned edges/weights after
each round of IMP, and employ the ACE technique to refine the GLT processing.
Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-GLT outperforms existing
methods for searching GLT in diverse tasks. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<p class="mathjax">Established surgical navigation systems for pedicle screw placement have been
proven to be accurate, but still reveal limitations in registration or surgical
guidance. Registration of preoperative data to the intraoperative anatomy
remains a time-consuming, error-prone task that includes exposure to harmful
radiation. Surgical guidance through conventional displays has well-known
drawbacks, as information cannot be presented in-situ and from the surgeon's
perspective. Consequently, radiation-free and more automatic registration
methods with subsequent surgeon-centric navigation feedback are desirable. In
this work, we present an approach that automatically solves the registration
problem for lumbar spinal fusion surgery in a radiation-free manner. A deep
neural network was trained to segment the lumbar spine and simultaneously
predict its orientation, yielding an initial pose for preoperative models,
which then is refined for each vertebra individually and updated in real-time
with GPU acceleration while handling surgeon occlusions. An intuitive surgical
guidance is provided thanks to the integration into an augmented reality based
navigation system. The registration method was verified on a public dataset
with a mean of 96\% successful registrations, a target registration error of
2.73 mm, a screw trajectory error of 1.79{\deg} and a screw entry point error
of 2.43 mm. Additionally, the whole pipeline was validated in an ex-vivo
surgery, yielding a 100\% screw accuracy and a registration accuracy of 1.20
mm. Our results meet clinical demands and emphasize the potential of RGB-D data
for fully automatic registration approaches in combination with augmented
reality guidance.

challenges for the stability and transient behavior of power systems which are
best understood by studying their dynamic responses through simulation. In this
paper, we develop an open source simulation toolbox,
PowerSimulationDynamics.jl, to study the dynamic response of a balanced system
with high penetration of inverter-based resources. PowerSimulationDynamics.jl
is implemented in the Julia language and features a rich library of synchronous
generator components and inverter models. In addition, it allows the study of
both quasi-static phasors that employ an admittance matrix representation for
the network and electromagnetic dq models that use a dynamic representation of

<p class="mathjax">Deep automation provided by self-organizing network (SON) features and their
emerging variants such as zero touch automation solutions is a key enabler for
increasingly dense wireless networks and pervasive Internet of Things (IoT). To
realize their objectives, most automation functionalities rely on the
Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) reports. The MDT reports are used to generate
inferences about network state and performance, thus dynamically change network
parameters accordingly. However, the collection of MDT reports from commodity
user devices, particularly low cost IoT devices, make them a vulnerable entry
point to launch an adversarial attack on emerging deeply automated wireless
networks. This adds a new dimension to the security threats in the IoT and
cellular networks. Existing literature on IoT, SON, or zero touch automation
does not address this important problem. In this paper, we investigate an
impactful, first of its kind adversarial attack that can be launched by
exploiting the malicious MDT reports from the compromised user equipment (UE).
We highlight the detrimental repercussions of this attack on the performance of
common network automation functions. We also propose a novel Malicious MDT
Reports Identification framework (MRIF) as a countermeasure to detect and
eliminate the malicious MDT reports using Machine Learning and verify it
through a use-case. Thus, the defense mechanism can provide the resilience and
robustness for zero touch automation SON engines against the adversarial MDT
attacks

<p class="mathjax">Sequential user modeling, a critical task in personalized recommender
systems, focuses on predicting the next item a user would prefer, requiring a
deep understanding of user behavior sequences. Despite the remarkable success
of Transformer-based models across various domains, their full potential in
comprehending user behavior remains untapped. In this paper, we re-examine
Transformer-like architectures aiming to advance state-of-the-art performance.
We start by revisiting the core building blocks of Transformer-based methods,
analyzing the effectiveness of the item-to-item mechanism within the context of
sequential user modeling. After conducting a thorough experimental analysis, we
identify three essential criteria for devising efficient sequential user
models, which we hope will serve as practical guidelines to inspire and shape
future designs. Following this, we introduce ConvFormer, a simple but powerful
modification to the Transformer architecture that meets these criteria,
yielding state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we present an acceleration
technique to minimize the complexity associated with processing extremely long
sequences. Experiments on four public datasets showcase ConvFormer's
superiority and confirm the validity of our proposed criteria.

<p class="mathjax">Domain transfer is a prevalent challenge in modern neural Information
Retrieval (IR). To overcome this problem, previous research has utilized
domain-specific manual annotations and synthetic data produced by consistency
filtering to finetune a general ranker and produce a domain-specific ranker.
However, training such consistency filters are computationally expensive, which
significantly reduces the model efficiency. In addition, consistency filtering
often struggles to identify retrieval intentions and recognize query and corpus
distributions in a target domain. In this study, we evaluate a more efficient
solution: replacing the consistency filter with either direct pseudo-labeling,
pseudo-relevance feedback, or unsupervised keyword generation methods for
achieving consistent filtering-free unsupervised dense retrieval. Our extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that, on average, TextRank-based pseudo
relevance feedback outperforms other methods. Furthermore, we analyzed the
training and inference efficiency of the proposed paradigm. The results
indicate that filtering-free unsupervised learning can continuously improve
training and inference efficiency while maintaining retrieval performance. In
some cases, it can even improve performance based on particular datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Science has long been viewed as a key driver of economic growth and rising
standards of living. Knowledge about how scientific advances support
marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of
science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The
increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications
and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new
opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology
at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. However, we lack suitable visual
analytics approaches to analyze such complex interactions effectively. Here we
introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for
researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex
linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations,
inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important
associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of
statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of the Science of
Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these
associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay
Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users
effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. This
visualization thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions
and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case
studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier
research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to
extract new insights for innovation.

<p class="mathjax">This paper conducts fairness testing on automated pedestrian detection, a
crucial but under-explored issue in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate
eight widely-studied pedestrian detectors across demographic groups on
large-scale real-world datasets. To enable thorough fairness testing, we
provide extensive annotations for the datasets, resulting in 8,311 images with
16,070 gender labels, 20,115 age labels, and 3,513 skin tone labels. Our
findings reveal significant fairness issues related to age and skin tone. The
detection accuracy for adults is 19.67% higher compared to children, and there
is a 7.52% accuracy disparity between light-skin and dark-skin individuals.
Gender, however, shows only a 1.1% difference in detection accuracy.
Additionally, we investigate common scenarios explored in the literature on
autonomous driving testing, and find that the bias towards dark-skin
pedestrians increases significantly under scenarios of low contrast and low
brightness. We publicly release the code, data, and results to support future
research on fairness in autonomous driving.

often run to inform decision-making processes. Uncertainty estimates of
simulation results are critical to the decision-making process because
simulation results of specific scenarios may have wide, but unspecified,
confidence bounds that may impact subsequent analyses and decisions. The
objective of this work is to develop a protocol to assess uncertainties in
predictions of machine learning and mechanistic simulation models. The protocol
will outline an uncertainty quantification workflow that may be used to
establish credible bounds of predictability on computed quantities of interest
and to assess model sufficiency. The protocol identifies key sources of
uncertainties in machine learning and mechanistic modeling, defines applicable
methods of uncertainty propagation for these sources, and includes
statistically rational estimators for output uncertainties. The work applies
the protocol to test cases relevant to the gas distribution industry and
presents learnings from its application. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion outlining a pathway to the wider adoption of uncertainty

<p class="mathjax">We present dPASP, a novel declarative probabilistic logic programming
framework for differentiable neuro-symbolic reasoning. The framework allows for
the specification of discrete probabilistic models with neural predicates,
logic constraints and interval-valued probabilistic choices, thus supporting
models that combine low-level perception (images, texts, etc), common-sense
reasoning, and (vague) statistical knowledge. To support all such features, we
discuss the several semantics for probabilistic logic programs that can express
nondeterministic, contradictory, incomplete and/or statistical knowledge. We
also discuss how gradient-based learning can be performed with neural
predicates and probabilistic choices under selected semantics. We then describe
an implemented package that supports inference and learning in the language,
along with several example programs. The package requires minimal user
knowledge of deep learning system's inner workings, while allowing end-to-end
training of rather sophisticated models and loss functions.

<p class="mathjax">Despite decades of efforts to resolve, memory safety violations are still
persistent and problematic in modern systems. Various defense mechanisms have
been proposed, but their deployment in real systems remains challenging because
of performance, security, or compatibility concerns. In this paper, we propose
RV-CURE, a RISC-V capability architecture that implements full-system support
for full memory safety. For capability enforcement, we first propose a compiler
technique, data-pointer tagging (DPT), applicable to protecting all memory
types. It inserts a pointer tag in a pointer address and associates that tag
with the pointer's capability metadata. DPT enforces a capability check for
every memory access by a tagged pointer and thereby prevents illegitimate
memory accesses. Furthermore, we investigate and present lightweight hardware
extensions for DPT based on the open-source RISC-V BOOM processor. We observe
that a capability-execution pipeline can be implemented in parallel with the
existing memory-execution pipeline without intrusive modifications. With our
seamless hardware integration, we achieve low-cost capability checks
transparently performed in hardware. Altogether, we prototype RV-CURE as a
synthesized RTL processor and conduct full-system evaluations on FPGAs running
Linux OS. Our evaluations show that RV-CURE achieves strong memory safety at a
10.8% slowdown across the SPEC 2017 C/C++ workloads.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the removal of motion blur in photographs has seen
impressive progress in the hands of deep learning-based methods, trained to map
directly from blurry to sharp images. For this reason, approaches that
explicitly use a forward degradation model received significantly less
attention. However, a well-defined specification of the blur genesis, as an
intermediate step, promotes the generalization and explainability of the
method. Towards this goal, we propose a learning-based motion deblurring method
based on dense non-uniform motion blur estimation followed by a non-blind
deconvolution approach. Specifically, given a blurry image, a first network
estimates the dense per-pixel motion blur kernels using a lightweight
representation composed of a set of image-adaptive basis motion kernels and the
corresponding mixing coefficients. Then, a second network trained jointly with
the first one, unrolls a non-blind deconvolution method using the motion kernel
field estimated by the first network. The model-driven aspect is further
promoted by training the networks on sharp/blurry pairs synthesized according
to a convolution-based, non-uniform motion blur degradation model. Qualitative
and quantitative evaluation shows that the kernel prediction network produces
accurate motion blur estimates, and that the deblurring pipeline leads to
restorations of real blurred images that are competitive or superior to those
obtained with existing end-to-end deep learning-based methods. Code and trained
models are available at https://github.com/GuillermoCarbajal/J-MKPD/.

<p class="mathjax">We argue that a key reasoning skill that any advanced AI, say GPT-4, should
master in order to qualify as 'thinking machine', or AGI, is
hypothetic-deductive reasoning. Problem-solving or question-answering can quite
generally be construed as involving two steps: hypothesizing that a certain set
of hypotheses T applies to the problem or question at hand, and deducing the
solution or answer from T - hence the term hypothetic-deductive reasoning. An
elementary proxy of hypothetic-deductive reasoning is causal reasoning. We
propose simple tests for both types of reasoning, and apply them to ChatGPT.
Our study shows that, at present, the chatbot has a limited capacity for either
type of reasoning, as soon as the problems considered are somewhat complex.
However, we submit that if an AI would be capable of this type of reasoning in
a sufficiently wide range of contexts, it would be an AGI.

extraction based on pre-trained language models. We construct a multi-source,
multi-domain corpus and train an end-to-end extraction pipeline. We then apply
multi-source task-adaptive pre-training and fine-tuning to benchmark the
cross-domain generalization capability of our model. Further, we conceptualize
and apply a task-specific error analysis and derive insights for future work.
Our results suggest that multi-source training leads to the best overall
results, while single-source training yields the best results for the

contextual entities. We make the cross-domain corpus used in this work

<p class="mathjax">Numerical methods for Inverse Kinematics (IK) employ iterative, linear
approximations of the IK until the end-effector is brought from its initial
pose to the desired final pose. These methods require the computation of the
Jacobian of the Forward Kinematics (FK) and its inverse in the linear
approximation of the IK. Despite all the successful implementations reported in
the literature, Jacobian-based IK methods can still fail to preserve certain
useful properties if an improper matrix inverse, e.g. Moore-Penrose (MP), is
employed for incommensurate robotic systems. In this paper, we propose a
systematic, robust and accurate numerical solution for the IK problem using the
Mixed (MX) Generalized Inverse (GI) applied to any type of Jacobians (e.g.,
analytical, numerical or geometric) derived for any commensurate and
incommensurate robot. This approach is robust to whether the system is
under-determined (less than 6 DoF) or over-determined (more than 6 DoF). We
investigate six robotics manipulators with various Degrees of Freedom (DoF) to
demonstrate that commonly used GI's fail to guarantee the same system behaviors
when the units are varied for incommensurate robotics manipulators. In
addition, we evaluate the proposed methodology as a global IK solver and
compare against well-known IK methods for redundant manipulators. Based on the
experimental results, we conclude that the right choice of GI is crucial in
preserving certain properties of the system (i.e. unit-consistency).

<p class="mathjax">The introduction of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google
Palm2 for smart contract generation seems to be the first well-established
instance of an AI pair programmer. LLMs have access to a large number of
open-source smart contracts, enabling them to utilize more extensive code in
Solidity than other code generation tools. Although the initial and informal
assessments of LLMs for smart contract generation are promising, a systematic
evaluation is needed to explore the limits and benefits of these models. The
main objective of this study is to assess the quality of generated code
provided by LLMs for smart contracts. We also aim to evaluate the impact of the
quality and variety of input parameters fed to LLMs. To achieve this aim, we
created an experimental setup for evaluating the generated code in terms of
validity, correctness, and efficiency. Our study finds crucial evidence of
security bugs getting introduced in the generated smart contracts as well as
the overall quality and correctness of the code getting impacted. However, we
also identified the areas where it can be improved. The paper also proposes
several potential research directions to improve the process, quality and
safety of generated smart contract codes.

to predict and understand the behaviour of systems and to find parameters from

<p class="mathjax">For the past 20 years, China has increasingly restricted the access of minors
to online games using addiction prevention systems (APSes). At the same time,
and through different means, i.e., the Great Firewall of China (GFW), it also
restricts general population access to the international Internet. This paper
studies how these restrictions impact young online gamers, and their evasion
efforts. We present results from surveys (n = 2,415) and semi-structured
interviews (n = 35) revealing viable commonly deployed APS evasion techniques
and APS vulnerabilities. We conclude that the APS does not work as designed,
even against very young online game players, and can act as a censorship
evasion training ground for tomorrow's adults, by familiarization with and
normalization of general evasion techniques, and desensitization to their
dangers. Findings from these studies may further inform developers of
censorship-resistant systems about the perceptions and evasion strategies of
their prospective users, and help design tools that leverage services and
platforms popular among the censored audience.

<p class="mathjax">This work focuses on the problem of reconstructing a 3D human body mesh from
a given 2D image. Despite the inherent ambiguity of the task of human mesh
recovery, most existing works have adopted a method of regressing a single
output. In contrast, we propose a generative approach framework, called
"Diffusion-based Human Mesh Recovery (Diff-HMR)" that takes advantage of the
denoising diffusion process to account for multiple plausible outcomes. During
the training phase, the SMPL parameters are diffused from ground-truth
parameters to random distribution, and Diff-HMR learns the reverse process of
this diffusion. In the inference phase, the model progressively refines the
given random SMPL parameters into the corresponding parameters that align with
the input image. Diff-HMR, being a generative approach, is capable of
generating diverse results for the same input image as the input noise varies.
We conduct validation experiments, and the results demonstrate that the
proposed framework effectively models the inherent ambiguity of the task of
human mesh recovery in a probabilistic manner. The code is available at
https://github.com/hanbyel0105/Diff-HMR

Pseudo-Inverse-based Repetitive Motion Planning (PRMP) schemes based on the
kinematic model of robotic manipulators. We show that without unit consistency
in the pseudo-inverse computation, path planning of incommensurate robotic
manipulators will fail. Also, we investigated the robustness and noise
tolerance of six PPP and PRMP schemes in the literature against various noise
types (i.e. zero, constant, time-varying and random noises). We compared the
simulated results using two redundant robotic manipulators: a 3DoF (2RP), and a
7DoF (2RP4R). These experimental results demonstrate that the improper
Generalized Inverse (GI) with arbitrary selection of unit and/or in the
presence of noise can lead to unexpected behavior of the robot, while producing
wrong instantaneous outputs in the task space, which results in distortions
and/or failures in the execution of the planned path. Finally, we propose and
demonstrate the efficacy of the Mixed Inverse (MX) as the proper GI to achieve
unit-consistency in path planning.

<p class="mathjax">Merging multi-exposure image stacks into a high dynamic range (HDR) image
requires knowledge of accurate exposure times. When exposure times are
inaccurate, for example, when they are extracted from a camera's EXIF metadata,
the reconstructed HDR images reveal banding artifacts at smooth gradients. To
remedy this, we propose to estimate exposure ratios directly from the input
images. We derive the exposure time estimation as an optimization problem, in
which pixels are selected from pairs of exposures to minimize estimation error
caused by camera noise. When pixel values are represented in the logarithmic
domain, the problem can be solved efficiently using a linear solver. We
demonstrate that the estimation can be easily made robust to pixel misalignment
caused by camera or object motion by collecting pixels from multiple spatial
tiles. The proposed automatic exposure estimation and alignment eliminates
banding artifacts in popular datasets and is essential for applications that
require physically accurate reconstructions, such as measuring the modulation
transfer function of a display. The code for the method is available.

Azure) has led to a huge increased demand for resources. This surge in demand
poses significant challenges to resource management in clouds. This paper aims
to highlight these challenges by first identifying the unique characteristics
of resource management for the GPT-based model. Building upon this
understanding, we analyze the specific challenges faced by resource management
in the context of GPT-based model deployed on clouds, and propose corresponding
potential solutions. To facilitate effective resource management, we introduce
a comprehensive resource management framework and present resource scheduling
algorithms specifically designed for the GPT-based model. Furthermore, we delve
into the future directions for resource management in the GPT-based model,
highlighting potential areas for further exploration and improvement. Through
this study, we aim to provide valuable insights into resource management for
GPT-based models deployed in clouds and promote their sustainable development
for GPT-based models and applications.

<p class="mathjax">The FIDO2 protocol aims to strengthen or replace password authentication
using public-key cryptography. FIDO2 has primarily focused on defending against
attacks from afar by remote attackers that compromise a password or attempt to
phish the user. In this paper, we explore threats from local attacks on FIDO2
that have received less attention -- a browser extension compromise and
attackers gaining physical access to an HSK. Our systematic analysis of current
implementations of FIDO2 reveals four underlying flaws, and we demonstrate the
feasibility of seven attacks that exploit those flaws. The flaws include (1)
Lack of confidentiality/integrity of FIDO2 messages accessible to browser
extensions, (2) Broken clone detection algorithm, (3) Potential for user
misunderstanding from social engineering and notification/error messages, and
(4) Cookie life cycle. We build malicious browser extensions and demonstrate
the attacks on ten popular web servers that use FIDO2. We also show that many
browser extensions have sufficient permissions to conduct the attacks if they
were compromised. A static and dynamic analysis of current browser extensions
finds no evidence of the attacks in the wild. We conducted two user studies
confirming that participants do not detect the attacks with current error
messages, email notifications, and UX responses to the attacks. We provide an
improved clone detection algorithm and recommendations for relying part

<p class="mathjax">The Spanish language is one of the top 5 spoken languages in the world.
Nevertheless, finding resources to train or evaluate Spanish language models is
not an easy task. In this paper we help bridge this gap by presenting a
BERT-based language model pre-trained exclusively on Spanish data. As a second
contribution, we also compiled several tasks specifically for the Spanish
language in a single repository much in the spirit of the GLUE benchmark. By
fine-tuning our pre-trained Spanish model, we obtain better results compared to
other BERT-based models pre-trained on multilingual corpora for most of the
tasks, even achieving a new state-of-the-art on some of them. We have publicly
released our model, the pre-training data, and the compilation of the Spanish
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, 3D representation learning has turned to 2D vision-language
pre-trained models to overcome data scarcity challenges. However, existing
methods simply transfer 2D alignment strategies, aligning 3D representations
with single-view 2D images and coarse-grained parent category text. These
approaches introduce information degradation and insufficient synergy issues,
leading to performance loss. Information degradation arises from overlooking
the fact that a 3D representation should be equivalent to a series of
multi-view images and more fine-grained subcategory text. Insufficient synergy
neglects the idea that a robust 3D representation should align with the joint
vision-language space, rather than independently aligning with each modality.
In this paper, we propose a multi-view joint modality modeling approach, termed
JM3D, to obtain a unified representation for point cloud, text, and image.
Specifically, a novel Structured Multimodal Organizer (SMO) is proposed to
address the information degradation issue, which introduces contiguous
multi-view images and hierarchical text to enrich the representation of vision
and language modalities. A Joint Multi-modal Alignment (JMA) is designed to
tackle the insufficient synergy problem, which models the joint modality by
incorporating language knowledge into the visual modality. Extensive
experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method, JM3D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
3D classification. JM3D outperforms ULIP by approximately 4.3% on PointMLP and
achieves an improvement of up to 6.5% accuracy on PointNet++ in top-1 accuracy
for zero-shot 3D classification on ModelNet40. The source code and trained
models for all our experiments are publicly available at
https://github.com/Mr-Neko/JM3D.

<p class="mathjax">Humans recognize anomalies through two aspects: larger patch-wise
representation discrepancies and weaker patch-to-normal-patch correlations.
However, the previous AD methods didn't sufficiently combine the two
complementary aspects to design AD models. To this end, we find that
Transformer can ideally satisfy the two aspects as its great power in the
unified modeling of patch-wise representations and patch-to-patch correlations.
In this paper, we propose a novel AD framework: FOcus-the-Discrepancy (FOD),
which can simultaneously spot the patch-wise, intra- and inter-discrepancies of
anomalies. The major characteristic of our method is that we renovate the
self-attention maps in transformers to Intra-Inter-Correlation (I2Correlation).
The I2Correlation contains a two-branch structure to first explicitly establish
intra- and inter-image correlations, and then fuses the features of two-branch
to spotlight the abnormal patterns. To learn the intra- and inter-correlations
adaptively, we propose the RBF-kernel-based target-correlations as learning
targets for self-supervised learning. Besides, we introduce an entropy
constraint strategy to solve the mode collapse issue in optimization and
further amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability. Extensive experiments
on three unsupervised real-world AD benchmarks show the superior performance of
our approach. Code will be available at https://github.com/xcyao00/FOD.

<p class="mathjax">In the medical domain, several disease treatment procedures have been
documented properly as a set of instructions known as Clinical Practice
Guidelines (CPGs). CPGs have been developed over the years on the basis of past
treatments, and are updated frequently. A doctor treating a particular patient
can use these CPGs to know how past patients with similar conditions were
treated successfully and can find the recommended treatment procedure. In this
paper, we present a Decision Knowledge Graph (DKG) representation to store CPGs
and to perform question-answering on CPGs. CPGs are very complex and no
existing representation is suitable to perform question-answering and searching
tasks on CPGs. As a result, doctors and practitioners have to manually wade
through the guidelines, which is inefficient. Representation of CPGs is
challenging mainly due to frequent updates on CPGs and decision-based
structure. Our proposed DKG has a decision dimension added to a Knowledge Graph
(KG) structure, purported to take care of decision based behavior of CPGs.
Using this DKG has shown 40\% increase in accuracy compared to fine-tuned
BioBert model in performing question-answering on CPGs. To the best of our
knowledge, ours is the first attempt at creating DKGs and using them for
representing CPGs.

<p class="mathjax">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among diabetic
patients. Deep learning models have shown promising results in automating the
detection of DR. In the present work, we propose a new methodology that
integrates a feature attention module with a pretrained VGG19 convolutional
neural network (CNN) for more accurate DR detection. Here, the pretrained net
is fine-tuned with the proposed feature attention block. The proposed module
aims to leverage the complementary information from various regions of fundus
images to enhance the discriminative power of the CNN. The said feature
attention module incorporates an attention mechanism which selectively
highlights salient features from images and fuses them with the original input.
The simultaneous learning of attention weights for the features and thereupon
the combination of attention-modulated features within the feature attention
block facilitates the network's ability to focus on relevant information while
reducing the impact of noisy or irrelevant features. Performance of the
proposed method has been evaluated on a widely used dataset for diabetic
retinopathy classification e.g., the APTOS (Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology
Society) DR Dataset. Results are compared with/without attention module, as
well as with other state-of-the-art approaches. Results confirm that the
introduction of the fusion module (fusing of feature attention module with CNN)
improves the accuracy of DR detection achieving an accuracy of 95.70%.

<p class="mathjax">While the novel class discovery has achieved great success, existing methods
usually evaluate their algorithms on balanced datasets. However, in real-world
visual recognition tasks, the class distribution of a dataset is often
long-tailed, making it challenging to apply those methods. In this paper, we
propose a more realistic setting for novel class discovery where the
distribution of novel and known classes is long-tailed. The challenge of this
new problem is to discover novel classes with the help of known classes under
an imbalanced class scenario. To discover imbalanced novel classes efficiently,
we propose an adaptive self-labeling strategy based on an equiangular prototype
representation. Our method infers better pseudo-labels for the novel classes by
solving a relaxed optimal transport problem and effectively mitigates the
biases in learning the known and novel classes. The extensive results on
CIFAR100, ImageNet100, and the challenging Herbarium19 and large-scale
iNaturalist18 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Binary code similarity detection is to detect the similarity of code at
binary (assembly) level without source code. Existing works have their
limitations when dealing with mutated binary code generated by different
compiling options. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to addressing
this problem. By inspecting the binary code, we found that generally, within a
function, some instructions aim to calculate (prepare) values for other
instructions. The latter instructions are defined by us as key instructions.
Currently, we define four categories of key instructions: calling subfunctions,
comparing instruction, returning instruction, and memory-store instruction.
Thus if we symbolically execute similar binary codes, symbolic values at these
key instructions are expected to be similar. As such, we implement a prototype
tool, which has three steps. First, it symbolically executes binary code;
Second, it extracts symbolic values at defined key instructions into a graph;
Last, it compares the symbolic graph similarity. In our implementation, we also
address some problems, including path explosion and loop handling.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion distribution learning has gained increasing attention with the
tendency to express emotions through images. As for emotion ambiguity arising
from humans' subjectivity, substantial previous methods generally focused on
learning appropriate representations from the holistic or significant part of
images. However, they rarely consider establishing connections with the
stylistic information although it can lead to a better understanding of images.
In this paper, we propose a style-guided high-order attention network for image
emotion distribution learning termed StyleEDL, which interactively learns
stylistic-aware representations of images by exploring the hierarchical
stylistic information of visual contents. Specifically, we consider exploring
the intra- and inter-layer correlations among GRAM-based stylistic
representations, and meanwhile exploit an adversary-constrained high-order
attention mechanism to capture potential interactions between subtle visual
parts. In addition, we introduce a stylistic graph convolutional network to
dynamically generate the content-dependent emotion representations to benefit
the final emotion distribution learning. Extensive experiments conducted on
several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
StyleEDL compared to state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is released
at: https://github.com/liuxianyi/StyleEDL.

viable solution that leverages self-training methods to pseudo-label
high-confidence regions and adapt the model to the target data. However, the
confidence scores obtained are often highly biased due to over-confidence and
class-imbalance issues, which render both model selection and optimization
problematic. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration-guided source-free
domain adaptive semantic segmentation (Cal-SFDA) framework. The core idea is to
estimate the expected calibration error (ECE) from the segmentation
predictions, serving as a strong indicator of the model's generalization
capability to the unlabeled target domain. The estimated ECE scores, in turn,
assist the model training and fair selection in both source training and target
adaptation stages. During model pre-training on the source domain, we ensure
the differentiability of the ECE objective by leveraging the LogSumExp trick
and using ECE scores to select the best source checkpoints for adaptation. To
enable ECE estimation on the target domain without requiring labels, we train a
value net for ECE estimation and apply statistic warm-up on its BatchNorm
layers for stability. The estimated ECE scores assist in determining the
reliability of prediction and enable class-balanced pseudo-labeling by
positively guiding the adaptation progress and inhibiting potential error
accumulation. Extensive experiments on two widely-used synthetic-to-real
transfer tasks show that the proposed approach surpasses previous
state-of-the-art by up to 5.25% of mIoU with fair model selection criteria.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a novel class of pre-transformed polar codes,
termed as deep polar codes. We first present a deep polar encoder that
harnesses a series of multi-layered polar transformations with varying sizes.
Our approach to encoding enables a low-complexity implementation while
significantly enhancing the weight distribution of the code. Moreover, our
encoding method offers flexibility in rate-profiling, embracing a wide range of
code rates and blocklengths. Next, we put forth a low-complexity decoding
algorithm called successive cancellation list with backpropagation parity
checks (SCL-BPC). This decoding algorithm leverages the parity check equations
in the reverse process of the multi-layered pre-transformed encoding for SCL
decoding. Additionally, we present a low-latency decoding algorithm that
employs parallel-SCL decoding by treating partially pre-transformed bit
patterns as additional frozen bits. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
deep polar codes outperform existing pre-transformed polar codes in terms of
block error rates across various code rates under short block lengths, while
maintaining low encoding and decoding complexity. Furthermore, we show that
concatenating deep polar codes with cyclic-redundancy-check codes can achieve
the meta-converse bound of the finite block length capacity within 0.4 dB in
some instances.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel transformer-based framework that aims to enhance
weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) by generating accurate
class-specific object localization maps as pseudo labels. Building upon the
observation that the attended regions of the one-class token in the standard
vision transformer can contribute to a class-agnostic localization map, we
explore the potential of the transformer model to capture class-specific
attention for class-discriminative object localization by learning multiple
class tokens. We introduce a Multi-Class Token transformer, which incorporates
multiple class tokens to enable class-aware interactions with the patch tokens.
To achieve this, we devise a class-aware training strategy that establishes a
one-to-one correspondence between the output class tokens and the ground-truth
class labels. Moreover, a Contrastive-Class-Token (CCT) module is proposed to
enhance the learning of discriminative class tokens, enabling the model to
better capture the unique characteristics and properties of each class. As a
result, class-discriminative object localization maps can be effectively
generated by leveraging the class-to-patch attentions associated with different
class tokens. To further refine these localization maps, we propose the
utilization of patch-level pairwise affinity derived from the patch-to-patch
transformer attention. Furthermore, the proposed framework seamlessly
complements the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method, resulting in
significantly improved WSSS performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
datasets. These results underline the importance of the class token for WSSS.

<p class="mathjax">Visual inspection is predominantly used to evaluate the state of civil
structures, but recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
artificial intelligence have increased the speed, safety, and reliability of
the inspection process. In this study, we develop a semantic segmentation
network based on vision transformers and Laplacian pyramids scaling networks
for efficiently parsing high-resolution visual inspection images. The massive
amounts of collected high-resolution images during inspections can slow down
the investigation efforts. And while there have been extensive studies
dedicated to the use of deep learning models for damage segmentation,
processing high-resolution visual data can pose major computational
difficulties. Traditionally, images are either uniformly downsampled or
partitioned to cope with computational demands. However, the input is at risk
of losing local fine details, such as thin cracks, or global contextual
information. Inspired by super-resolution architectures, our vision transformer
model learns to resize high-resolution images and masks to retain both the
valuable local features and the global semantics without sacrificing
computational efficiency. The proposed framework has been evaluated through
comprehensive experiments on a dataset of bridge inspection report images using
multiple metrics for pixel-wise materials detection.

encountering different terrains and velocity commands. In this work, we present
an end-to-end training framework for learning multiple gaits for quadruped
robots, tailored to the needs of robust locomotion, agile locomotion, and
user's commands. A latent space is constructed concurrently by a gait encoder
and a gait generator, which helps the agent to reuse multiple gait skills to
achieve adaptive gait behaviors. To learn natural behaviors for multiple gaits,
we design gait-dependent rewards that are constructed explicitly from gait

<p class="mathjax">Spike camera is a new type of bio-inspired vision sensor that records light
intensity in the form of a spike array with high temporal resolution (20,000
Hz). This new paradigm of vision sensor offers significant advantages for many
vision tasks such as high speed image reconstruction. However, existing
spike-based approaches typically assume that the scenes are with sufficient
light intensity, which is usually unavailable in many real-world scenarios such
as rainy days or dusk scenes. To unlock more spike-based application scenarios,
we propose a Recurrent Spike-based Image Restoration (RSIR) network, which is
the first work towards restoring clear images from spike arrays under general
illumination. Specifically, to accurately describe the noise distribution under
different illuminations, we build a physical-based spike noise model according
to the sampling process of the spike camera. Based on the noise model, we
design our RSIR network which consists of an adaptive spike transformation
module, a recurrent temporal feature fusion module, and a frequency-based spike
denoising module. Our RSIR can process the spike array in a recursive manner to
ensure that the spike temporal information is well utilized. In the training
process, we generate the simulated spike data based on our noise model to train
our network. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with different
illuminations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network. The code
and dataset are released at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/RSIR.

<p class="mathjax">Cough is a primary symptom of most respiratory diseases, and changes in cough
characteristics provide valuable information for diagnosing respiratory
diseases. The characterization of cough sounds still lacks concrete evidence,
which makes it difficult to accurately distinguish between different types of
coughs and other sounds. The objective of this research work is to characterize
cough sounds with voiced content and cough sounds without voiced content.
Further, the cough sound characteristics are compared with the characteristics
of speech. The proposed method to achieve this goal utilized spectral roll-off,
spectral entropy, spectral flatness, spectral flux, zero crossing rate,
spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth attributes which describe the cough
sounds related to the respiratory system, glottal information, and voice model.
These attributes are then subjected to statistical analysis using the measures
of minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation. The experimental
results show that the mean and frequency distribution of spectral roll-off,
spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth are found to be higher for cough
sounds than for speech signals. Spectral flatness levels in cough sounds will
rise to 0.22, whereas spectral flux varies between 0.3 and 0.6. The Zero
Crossing Rate (ZCR) of most frames of cough sounds is between 0.05 and 0.4.
These attributes contribute significant information while characterizing cough
sounds.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of image restoration is to recover high-quality images from distorted
ones. However, current methods usually focus on a single task (\emph{e.g.},
denoising, deblurring or super-resolution) which cannot address the needs of
real-world multi-task processing, especially on mobile devices. Thus,
developing an all-in-one method that can restore images from various unknown
distortions is a significant challenge. Previous works have employed
contrastive learning to learn the degradation representation from observed
images, but this often leads to representation drift caused by deficient
positive and negative pairs. To address this issue, we propose a novel
All-in-one Multi-degradation Image Restoration Network (AMIRNet) that can
effectively capture and utilize accurate degradation representation for image
restoration. AMIRNet learns a degradation representation for unknown degraded
images by progressively constructing a tree structure through clustering,
without any prior knowledge of degradation information. This tree-structured
representation explicitly reflects the consistency and discrepancy of various
distortions, providing a specific clue for image restoration. To further
enhance the performance of the image restoration network and overcome domain
gaps caused by unknown distortions, we design a feature transform block (FTB)
that aligns domains and refines features with the guidance of the degradation
representation. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple distorted
datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method and its advantages over
state-of-the-art restoration methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we study the task of ``visually" translating scene text from a
source language (e.g., English) to a target language (e.g., Chinese). Visual
translation involves not just the recognition and translation of scene text but
also the generation of the translated image that preserves visual features of
the text, such as font, size, and background. There are several challenges
associated with this task, such as interpolating font to unseen characters and
preserving text size and the background. To address these, we introduce VTNet,
a novel conditional diffusion-based method. To train the VTNet, we create a
synthetic cross-lingual dataset of 600K samples of scene text images in six
popular languages, including English, Hindi, Tamil, Chinese, Bengali, and
German. We evaluate the performance of VTnet through extensive experiments and
comparisons to related methods. Our model also surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art results on the conventional scene-text editing benchmarks.
Further, we present rigorous qualitative studies to understand the strengths
and shortcomings of our model. Results show that our approach generalizes well
to unseen words and fonts. We firmly believe our work can benefit real-world
applications, such as text translation using a phone camera and translating
educational materials. Code and data will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">The Dijkstra algorithm is a classic path planning method, which in a discrete
graph space, can start from a specified source node and find the shortest path
between the source node and all other nodes in the graph. However, to the best
of our knowledge, there is no effective method that achieves a function similar
to that of the Dijkstra's algorithm in a continuous space. In this study, an
optimal path planning algorithm called convex dissection topology
(CDT)-Dijkstra is developed, which can quickly compute the global optimal path
from one point to all other points in a 2D continuous space. CDT-Dijkstra is
mainly divided into two stages: SetInit and GetGoal. In SetInit, the algorithm
can quickly obtain the optimal CDT encoding set of all the cut lines based on
the initial point x_{init}. In GetGoal, the algorithm can return the global
optimal path of any goal point at an extremely high speed. In this study, we
propose and prove the planning principle of considering only the points on the
cutlines, thus reducing the state space of the distance optimal path planning
task from 2D to 1D. In addition, we propose a fast method to find the optimal
path in a homogeneous class and theoretically prove the correctness of the
method. Finally, by testing in a series of environments, the experimental
results demonstrate that CDT-Dijkstra not only plans the optimal path from all
points at once, but also has a significant advantage over advanced algorithms
considering certain complex tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In modern industries, fault diagnosis has been widely applied with the goal
of realizing predictive maintenance. The key issue for the fault diagnosis
system is to extract representative characteristics of the fault signal and
then accurately predict the fault type. In this paper, we propose a Causal
Disentanglement Hidden Markov model (CDHM) to learn the causality in the
bearing fault mechanism and thus, capture their characteristics to achieve a
more robust representation. Specifically, we make full use of the time-series
data and progressively disentangle the vibration signal into fault-relevant and
fault-irrelevant factors. The ELBO is reformulated to optimize the learning of
the causal disentanglement Markov model. Moreover, to expand the scope of the
application, we adopt unsupervised domain adaptation to transfer the learned
disentangled representations to other working environments. Experiments were
conducted on the CWRU dataset and IMS dataset. Relevant results validate the
superiority of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">For industrial control, developing high-performance controllers with few
samples and low technical debt is appealing. Foundation models, possessing rich
prior knowledge obtained from pre-training with Internet-scale corpus, have the
potential to be a good controller with proper prompts. In this paper, we take
HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) building control as an
example to examine the ability of GPT-4 (one of the first-tier foundation
models) as the controller. To control HVAC, we wrap the task as a language game
by providing text including a short description for the task, several selected
demonstrations, and the current observation to GPT-4 on each step and execute
the actions responded by GPT-4. We conduct series of experiments to answer the
following questions: 1)~How well can GPT-4 control HVAC? 2)~How well can GPT-4
generalize to different scenarios for HVAC control? 3) How different parts of
the text context affect the performance? In general, we found GPT-4 achieves
the performance comparable to RL methods with few samples and low technical
debt, indicating the potential of directly applying foundation models to
industrial control tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the perceptual quality of
an image captured in low-light conditions. Generally, a low-light image can be
divided into lightness and chrominance components. Recent advances in this area
mainly focus on the refinement of the lightness, while ignoring the role of
chrominance. It easily leads to chromatic aberration and, to some extent,
limits the diverse applications of chrominance in customized LLIE. In this
work, a ``brighten-and-colorize'' network (called BCNet), which introduces
image colorization to LLIE, is proposed to address the above issues. BCNet can
accomplish LLIE with accurate color and simultaneously enables customized
enhancement with varying saturations and color styles based on user
preferences. Specifically, BCNet regards LLIE as a multi-task learning problem:
brightening and colorization. The brightening sub-task aligns with other
conventional LLIE methods to get a well-lit lightness. The colorization
sub-task is accomplished by regarding the chrominance of the low-light image as
color guidance like the user-guide image colorization. Upon completion of model
training, the color guidance (i.e., input low-light chrominance) can be simply
manipulated by users to acquire customized results. This customized process is
optional and, due to its decoupled nature, does not compromise the structural
and detailed information of lightness. Extensive experiments on the commonly
used LLIE datasets show that the proposed method achieves both State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) performance and user-friendly customization.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Fourier frequency information has attracted much attention in
Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE). Some researchers noticed that, in the
Fourier space, the lightness degradation mainly exists in the amplitude
component and the rest exists in the phase component. By incorporating both the
Fourier frequency and the spatial information, these researchers proposed
remarkable solutions for LLIE. In this work, we further explore the positive
correlation between the magnitude of amplitude and the magnitude of lightness,
which can be effectively leveraged to improve the lightness of low-light images
in the Fourier space. Moreover, we find that the Fourier transform can extract
the global information of the image, and does not introduce massive neural
network parameters like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or Transformer. To this
end, a two-stage Fourier-based LLIE network (FourLLIE) is proposed. In the
first stage, we improve the lightness of low-light images by estimating the
amplitude transform map in the Fourier space. In the second stage, we introduce
the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) map to provide the prior for integrating the
global Fourier frequency and the local spatial information, which recovers
image details in the spatial space. With this ingenious design, FourLLIE
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLIE methods on four
representative datasets while maintaining good model efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-party collaborative training, such as distributed learning and
federated learning, is used to address the big data challenges. However,
traditional multi-party collaborative training algorithms were mainly designed
for balanced data mining tasks and are intended to optimize accuracy
(\emph{e.g.}, cross-entropy). The data distribution in many real-world
applications is skewed and classifiers, which are trained to improve accuracy,
perform poorly when applied to imbalanced data tasks since models could be
significantly biased toward the primary class. Therefore, the Area Under
Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) was introduced as an effective metric. Although
single-machine AUPRC maximization methods have been designed, multi-party
collaborative algorithm has never been studied. The change from the
single-machine to the multi-party setting poses critical challenges.
<br />To address the above challenge, we study the serverless multi-party
collaborative AUPRC maximization problem since serverless multi-party
collaborative training can cut down the communications cost by avoiding the
server node bottleneck, and reformulate it as a conditional stochastic
optimization problem in a serverless multi-party collaborative learning setting
and propose a new ServerLess biAsed sTochastic gradiEnt (SLATE) algorithm to
directly optimize the AUPRC. After that, we use the variance reduction
technique and propose ServerLess biAsed sTochastic gradiEnt with Momentum-based
variance reduction (SLATE-M) algorithm to improve the convergence rate, which
matches the best theoretical convergence result reached by the single-machine
online method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve
the multi-party collaborative AUPRC maximization problem.

<p class="mathjax">Infectious diseases, either emerging or long-lasting, place numerous people
at risk and bring heavy public health burdens worldwide. In the process against
infectious diseases, predicting the epidemic risk by modeling the disease
transmission plays an essential role in assisting with preventing and
controlling disease transmission in a more effective way. In this paper, we
systematically describe how machine learning can play an essential role in
quantitatively characterizing disease transmission patterns and accurately
predicting infectious disease risks. First, we introduce the background and
motivation of using machine learning for infectious disease risk prediction.
Next, we describe the development and components of various machine learning
models for infectious disease risk prediction. Specifically, existing models
fall into three categories: Statistical prediction, data-driven machine
learning, and epidemiology-inspired machine learning. Subsequently, we discuss
challenges encountered when dealing with model inputs, designing task-oriented
objectives, and conducting performance evaluation. Finally, we conclude with a
discussion of open questions and future directions.

<p class="mathjax">Video analysis tasks rely heavily on identifying the pixels from different
frames that correspond to the same visual target. To tackle this problem,
recent studies have advocated feature learning methods that aim to learn
distinctive representations to match the pixels, especially in a
self-supervised fashion. Unfortunately, these methods have difficulties for
tiny or even single-pixel visual targets. Pixel-wise video correspondences were
traditionally related to optical flows, which however lead to deterministic
correspondences and lack robustness on real-world videos. We address the
problem of learning features for establishing pixel-wise correspondences.
Motivated by optical flows as well as the self-supervised feature learning, we
propose to use not only labeled synthetic videos but also unlabeled real-world
videos for learning fine-grained representations in a holistic framework. We
adopt an adversarial learning scheme to enhance the generalization ability of
the learned features. Moreover, we design a coarse-to-fine framework to pursue
high computational efficiency. Our experimental results on a series of
correspondence-based tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art rivals in both accuracy and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the Achievable Information Rate (AIR) of a diffusive
Molecular Communication (MC) channel featuring a fully absorbing receiver that
counts the absorbed particles during symbol time intervals (STIs) and resets
the counter at the start of each interval. The MC channel, influenced by memory
effect, experiences inter-symbol interference (ISI) arising from the molecules'
delayed arrival. The channel's memory is quantified as an integer multiple of
the STI and a single-sample memoryless detector is employed to mitigate
complexity in computing the mutual information (MI). To maximize MI, the
detector threshold is optimized under Gaussian approximation of its input. The
channel's MI is calculated, considering the influence of ISI, in the context of
binary concentration shift keying modulation. Two distinct scenarios were
considered; independent and correlated source-generated symbols, the latter
modeled as a first-order Markov process. For each communication scenario, two
degrees of knowledge: ISI-Aware and ISI-Unaware were considered. Remarkably, it
is demonstrated that employing a correlated source enables the attainment of
higher capacity. The results indicate that the capacity-achieving input
distribution is not necessarily uniform. Notably, when the STI is small,
corresponding to the case of strong ISI, the maximum AIR is not achieved
through equiprobable symbol transmission.

computational semantics. In NLP, they have been used for retrofitting word
embeddings or augmenting contextual representations in language models.
However, lexical resources containing definitions exhibit a wide range of
properties, which has implications in the behaviour of models trained and
evaluated on them. In this paper, we introduce 3D- EX , a dataset that aims to
fill this gap by combining well-known English resources into one centralized

<p class="mathjax">Transductive Few-Shot Learning (TFSL) has recently attracted increasing
attention since it typically outperforms its inductive peer by leveraging
statistics of query samples. However, previous TFSL methods usually encode
uniform prior that all the classes within query samples are equally likely,
which is biased in imbalanced TFSL and causes severe performance degradation.
<br />Given this pivotal issue, in this work, we propose a novel Conditional
Transport (CT) based imbalanced TFSL model called {\textbf P}rototypes-oriented
{\textbf U}nbiased {\textbf T}ransfer {\textbf M}odel (PUTM) to fully exploit
unbiased statistics of imbalanced query samples, which employs forward and
backward navigators as transport matrices to balance the prior of query samples
per class between uniform and adaptive data-driven distributions. For
efficiently transferring statistics learned by CT, we further derive a closed
form solution to refine prototypes based on MAP given the learned navigators.
The above two steps of discovering and transferring unbiased statistics follow
an iterative manner, formulating our EM-based solver.
<br />Experimental results on four standard benchmarks including miniImageNet,
tieredImageNet, CUB, and CIFAR-FS demonstrate superiority of our model in
class-imbalanced generalization.

<p class="mathjax">Recent stereo matching networks achieves dramatic performance by introducing
epipolar line constraint to limit the matching range of dual-view. However, in
complicated real-world scenarios, the feature information based on
intra-epipolar line alone is too weak to facilitate stereo matching. In this
paper, we present a simple but highly effective network called Alternated
Attention U-shaped Transformer (AAUformer) to balance the impact of epipolar
line in dual and single view respectively for excellent generalization
performance. Compared to other models, our model has several main designs: 1)
to better liberate the local semantic features of the single-view at pixel
level, we introduce window self-attention to break the limits of intra-row
self-attention and completely replace the convolutional network for denser
features before cross-matching; 2) the multi-scale alternated attention
backbone network was designed to extract invariant features in order to
achieves the coarse-to-fine matching process for hard-to-discriminate regions.
We performed a series of both comparative studies and ablation studies on
several mainstream stereo matching datasets. The results demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art on the Scene Flow dataset, and the fine-tuning
performance is competitive on the KITTI 2015 dataset. In addition, for cross
generalization experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, our model
outperforms several state-of-the-art works.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) finetuned to follow human instructions have
recently emerged as a breakthrough in AI. Models such as Google Bard and OpenAI
ChatGPT, for example, are surprisingly powerful tools for question answering,
code debugging, and dialogue generation. Despite the purported multilingual
proficiency of these models, their linguistic inclusivity remains
insufficiently explored. Considering this constraint, we present a thorough
assessment of Bard and ChatGPT (encompassing both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) regarding
their machine translation proficiencies across ten varieties of Arabic. Our
evaluation covers diverse Arabic varieties such as Classical Arabic, Modern
Standard Arabic, and several nuanced dialectal variants. Furthermore, we
undertake a human-centric study to scrutinize the efficacy of the most recent
model, Bard, in following human instructions during translation tasks. Our
exhaustive analysis indicates that LLMs may encounter challenges with certain
Arabic dialects, particularly those for which minimal public data exists, such
as Algerian and Mauritanian dialects. However, they exhibit satisfactory
performance with more prevalent dialects, albeit occasionally trailing behind
established commercial systems like Google Translate. Additionally, our
analysis reveals a circumscribed capability of Bard in aligning with human
instructions in translation contexts. Collectively, our findings underscore
that prevailing LLMs remain far from inclusive, with only limited ability to
cater for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of diverse communities.

<p class="mathjax">The control of a battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential for
the thermal safety, energy efficiency, and durability of electric vehicles
(EVs) in hot weather. To address the battery cooling optimization problem, this
paper utilizes dynamic programming (DP) to develop an online rule-based control
strategy. Firstly, an electrical-thermal-aging model of the $\rm LiFePO_4$
battery pack is established. A control-oriented onboard BTMS model is proposed
and verified under different speed profiles and temperatures. Then in the DP
framework, a cost function consisting of battery aging cost and cooling-induced
electricity cost is minimized to obtain the optimal compressor power. By
exacting three rules "fast cooling, slow cooling, and temperature-maintaining"
from the DP result, a near-optimal rule-based cooling strategy, which uses as
much regenerative energy as possible to cool the battery pack, is proposed for
online execution. Simulation results show that the proposed online strategy can
dramatically improve the driving economy and reduce battery degradation under
diverse operation conditions, achieving less than a 3% difference in battery
loss compared to the offline DP. Recommendations regarding battery cooling
under different real-world cases are finally provided.

<p class="mathjax">Adjusting the photo color to associate with some design elements is an
essential way for a graphic design to effectively deliver its message and make
it aesthetically pleasing. However, existing tools and previous works face a
dilemma between the ease of use and level of expressiveness. To this end, we
introduce an interactive language-based approach for photo recoloring, which
provides an intuitive system that can assist both experts and novices on
graphic design. Given a graphic design containing a photo that needs to be
recolored, our model can predict the source colors and the target regions, and
then recolor the target regions with the source colors based on the given
language-based instruction. The multi-granularity of the instruction allows
diverse user intentions. The proposed novel task faces several unique
challenges, including: 1) color accuracy for recoloring with exactly the same
color from the target design element as specified by the user; 2)
multi-granularity instructions for parsing instructions correctly to generate a
specific result or multiple plausible ones; and 3) locality for recoloring in
semantically meaningful local regions to preserve original image semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose a model called LangRecol with two main
components: the language-based source color prediction module and the
semantic-palette-based photo recoloring module. We also introduce an approach
for generating a synthetic graphic design dataset with instructions to enable
model training. We evaluate our model via extensive experiments and user
studies. We also discuss several practical applications, showing the
effectiveness and practicality of our approach. Code and data for this paper
are at: https://zhenwwang.github.io/langrecol.

<p class="mathjax">Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a fundamental task in computer vision that
has witnessed remarkable progress with deep neural networks. Inspired by the
characteristics of the human visual system, existing methods typically use a
combination of global and local representations (\ie, multi-scale features) to
achieve superior performance. However, most of them adopt simple linear fusion
of multi-scale features, and neglect their possibly complex relationship and
interaction. In contrast, humans typically first form a global impression to
locate important regions and then focus on local details in those regions. We
therefore propose a top-down approach that uses high-level semantics to guide
the IQA network to focus on semantically important local distortion regions,
named as \emph{TOPIQ}. Our approach to IQA involves the design of a heuristic
coarse-to-fine network (CFANet) that leverages multi-scale features and
progressively propagates multi-level semantic information to low-level
representations in a top-down manner. A key component of our approach is the
proposed cross-scale attention mechanism, which calculates attention maps for
lower level features guided by higher level features. This mechanism emphasizes
active semantic regions for low-level distortions, thereby improving
performance. CFANet can be used for both Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference
(NR) IQA. We use ResNet50 as its backbone and demonstrate that CFANet achieves
better or competitive performance on most public FR and NR benchmarks compared
with state-of-the-art methods based on vision transformers, while being much
more efficient (with only ${\sim}13\%$ FLOPS of the current best FR method).

<p class="mathjax">Understanding human interaction with objects is an important research topic
for embodied Artificial Intelligence and identifying the objects that humans
are interacting with is a primary problem for interaction understanding.
Existing methods rely on frame-based detectors to locate interacting objects.
However, this approach is subjected to heavy occlusions, background clutter,
and distracting objects. To address the limitations, in this paper, we propose
to leverage spatio-temporal information of hand-object interaction to track
interactive objects under these challenging cases. Without prior knowledge of
the general objects to be tracked like object tracking problems, we first
utilize the spatial relation between hands and objects to adaptively discover
the interacting objects from the scene. Second, the consistency and continuity
of the appearance of objects between successive frames are exploited to track
the objects. With this tracking formulation, our method also benefits from
training on large-scale general object-tracking datasets. We further curate a
video-level hand-object interaction dataset for testing and evaluation from
100DOH. The quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in scenes with
continuous interaction with different objects, we achieve an impressive
improvement of about 10% as evaluated using the Average Precision (AP) metric.
Our qualitative findings also illustrate that our method can produce more
continuous trajectories for interacting objects.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the scarcity of manually annotated data required for fine-grained
video understanding, few-shot fine-grained (FS-FG) action recognition has
gained significant attention, with the aim of classifying novel fine-grained
action categories with only a few labeled instances. Despite the progress made
in FS coarse-grained action recognition, current approaches encounter two
challenges when dealing with the fine-grained action categories: the inability
to capture subtle action details and the insufficiency of learning from limited
data that exhibit high intra-class variance and inter-class similarity. To
address these limitations, we propose M$^3$Net, a matching-based framework for
FS-FG action recognition, which incorporates \textit{multi-view encoding},
\textit{multi-view matching}, and \textit{multi-view fusion} to facilitate
embedding encoding, similarity matching, and decision making across multiple
viewpoints. \textit{Multi-view encoding} captures rich contextual details from
the intra-frame, intra-video, and intra-episode perspectives, generating
customized higher-order embeddings for fine-grained data. \textit{Multi-view
matching} integrates various matching functions enabling flexible relation
modeling within limited samples to handle multi-scale spatio-temporal
variations by leveraging the instance-specific, category-specific, and
task-specific perspectives. \textit{Multi-view fusion} consists of
matching-predictions fusion and matching-losses fusion over the above views,
where the former promotes mutual complementarity and the latter enhances
embedding generalizability by employing multi-task collaborative learning.
Explainable visualizations and experimental results on three challenging
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of M$^3$Net in capturing fine-grained
action details and achieving state-of-the-art performance for FS-FG action
recognition.

need of hardware solutions for the evaluation of these theoretical results and
further advancing the field. The most common solutions proposed in the
literature are based on varactors, Positive Intrinsic-Negative (PIN) diodes,
and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). This paper presents the use of
Liquid Crystal (LC) technology for the realization of continuously tunable
extremely large millimeter-wave RISs. We review the basic physical principles
of LC theory, introduce two different realizations of LC-RISs, namely
reflect-array and phased-array, and highlight their key properties that have an
impact on the system design and RIS reconfiguration strategy. Moreover, the LC
technology is compared with the competing technologies in terms of feasibility,
cost, power consumption, reconfiguration speed, and bandwidth. Furthermore,
several important open problems for both theoretical and experimental research
on LC-RISs are presented.

<p class="mathjax">The Bounded Knapsack problem is one of the most fundamental NP-complete
problems at the intersection of computer science, optimization, and operations
research. A recent line of research worked towards understanding the complexity
of pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for Bounded Knapsack parameterized by the
maximum item weight $w_{\mathrm{max}}$ and the number of items $n$. A
conditional lower bound rules out that Bounded Knapsack can be solved in time
$O((n+w_{\mathrm{max}})^{2-\delta})$ for any $\delta &gt; 0$ [Cygan, Mucha,
Wegrzycki, Wlodarczyk'17, K\"unnemann, Paturi, Schneider'17]. This raised the
question whether Bounded Knapsack can be solved in time $\tilde
O((n+w_{\mathrm{max}})^2)$. The quest of resolving this question lead to
algorithms that run in time $\tilde O(n^3 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ [Tamir'09],
$\tilde O(n^2 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ and $\tilde O(n w_{\mathrm{max}}^3)$
[Bateni, Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Stein'18], $O(n^2 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ and
$\tilde O(n w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ [Eisenbrand and Weismantel'18], $O(n +
w_{\mathrm{max}}^3)$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki'21], and very recently
$\tilde O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^{12/5})$ [Chen, Lian, Mao, Zhang'23].
<br />In this paper we resolve this question by designing an algorithm for Bounded
Knapsack with running time $\tilde O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$, which is
conditionally near-optimal.

<p class="mathjax">When dealing with large graphs, community detection is a useful data triage
tool that can identify subsets of the network that a data analyst should
investigate. In an adversarial scenario, the graph may be manipulated to avoid
scrutiny of certain nodes by the analyst. Robustness to such behavior is an
important consideration for data analysts in high-stakes scenarios such as
cyber defense and counterterrorism. In this paper, we evaluate the use of
overlapping community detection methods in the presence of adversarial attacks
aimed at lowering the priority of a specific vertex. We formulate the data
analyst's choice as a Stackelberg game in which the analyst chooses a community
detection method and the attacker chooses an attack strategy in response.
Applying various attacks from the literature to seven real network datasets, we
find that, when the attacker has a sufficient budget, overlapping community
detection methods outperform non-overlapping methods, often overwhelmingly so.
This is the case when the attacker can only add edges that connect to the
target and when the capability is added to add edges between neighbors of the
target. We also analyze the tradeoff between robustness in the presence of an
attack and performance when there is no attack. Our extensible analytic
framework enables network data analysts to take these considerations into
account and incorporate new attacks and community detection methods as they are
developed.

<p class="mathjax">Group recommender systems (GRS) identify items to recommend to a group by
aggregating group members' individual preferences into a group profile. The
preference aggregation strategy used to build the group profile can also be
used for predicting the item that a group may decide to choose, i.e., by
assuming that the group is applying exactly that strategy. However, predicting
the choice of a group is challenging since the RS is not aware of the precise
preference aggregation strategy that is going to be used by the group. Hence,
the aim of this paper is to validate the research hypothesis that, by using a
machine learning approach and a data set of observed group choices, it is
possible to predict a group's final choice, better than by using a standard
preference aggregation strategy. Inspired by Social Decision Scheme theory,
which first tried to address the group choice prediction problem, we search for
a group profile definition that, in conjunction with a machine learning model,
can be used to accurately predict a group choice. Moreover, to cope with the
data scarcity problem, we propose two data augmentation methods, which add
synthetic group profiles to the training data, and we hypothesise they can
further improve the choice prediction accuracy. We validate our research
hypotheses by using a data set containing 282 participants organized in 79
groups. The experiments indicate that the proposed methods outperform baseline
aggregation strategies when used for group choice prediction. The proposed
method is robust with the presence of missing preference data and achieves a
performance superior to what human can achieve on the group choice prediction
task. Finally, the proposed data augmentation method can also improve the
prediction accuracy. Our approach can be exploited in novel GRSs to identify
the items that the group is likely to choose and help the group to make a
better choice.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate modeling of complex physical problems, such as fluid-structure
interaction, requires multiphysics coupling across the interface, which often
has intricate geometry and dynamic boundaries. Conventional numerical methods
face challenges in handling interface conditions. Deep neural networks offer a
mesh-free and flexible alternative, but they suffer from drawbacks such as
time-consuming optimization and local optima. In this paper, we propose a
mesh-free approach based on Randomized Neural Networks (RNNs), which avoid
optimization solvers during training, making them more efficient than
traditional deep neural networks. Our approach, called Local Randomized Neural
Networks (LRNNs), uses different RNNs to approximate solutions in different
subdomains. We discretize the interface problem into a linear system at
randomly sampled points across the domain, boundary, and interface using a
finite difference scheme, and then solve it by a least-square method. For
time-dependent interface problems, we use a space-time approach based on LRNNs.
We show the effectiveness and robustness of the LRNNs methods through numerical
examples of elliptic and parabolic interface problems. We also demonstrate that
our approach can handle high-dimension interface problems. Compared to
conventional numerical methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy with
fewer degrees of freedom, eliminates the need for complex interface meshing and
fitting, and significantly reduces training time, outperforming deep neural
networks.

<p class="mathjax">We develop the Randomized Neural Networks with Petrov-Galerkin Methods
(RNN-PG methods) to solve linear elasticity problems. RNN-PG methods use
Petrov-Galerkin variational framework, where the solution is approximated by
randomized neural networks and the test functions are piecewise polynomials.
Unlike conventional neural networks, the parameters of the hidden layers of the
randomized neural networks are fixed randomly, while the parameters of the
output layer are determined by the least square method, which can effectively
approximate the solution. We also develop mixed RNN-PG methods for linear
elasticity problems, which ensure the symmetry of the stress tensor and avoid
locking effects. We compare RNN-PG methods with the finite element method, the
mixed discontinuous Galerkin method, and the physics-informed neural network on
several examples, and the numerical results demonstrate that RNN-PG methods
achieve higher accuracy and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we tackle the challenging fine-grained edge detection task,
which refers to predicting specific edges caused by reflectance, illumination,
normal, and depth changes, respectively. Prior methods exploit multi-scale
convolutional networks, which are limited in three aspects: (1) Convolutions
are local operators while identifying the cause of edge formation requires
looking at far away pixels. (2) Priors specific to edge cause are fixed in
prediction heads. (3) Using separate networks for generic and fine-grained edge
detection, and the constraint between them may be violated. To address these
three issues, we propose a two-stage transformer-based network sequentially
predicting generic edges and fine-grained edges, which has a global receptive
field thanks to the attention mechanism. The prior knowledge of edge causes is
formulated as four learnable cause tokens in a cause-aware decoder design.
Furthermore, to encourage the consistency between generic edges and
fine-grained edges, an edge aggregation and alignment loss is exploited. We
evaluate our method on the public benchmark BSDS-RIND and several newly derived
benchmarks, and achieve new state-of-the-art results. Our code, data, and
models are publicly available at https://github.com/Daniellli/ECT.git.

Because of their violent nature, extreme events typically have adverse
consequences, which call for methods to prevent the events from happening. In
this work, we introduce the control-aware echo state network (Ca-ESN) to
seamlessly combine ESNs and control strategies, such as
proportional-integral-derivative and model predictive control, to suppress
extreme events. The methodology is showcased on a chaotic-turbulent flow, in
which we reduce the occurrence of extreme events with respect to traditional
methods by two orders of magnitude. This works opens up new possibilities for
the efficient control of nonlinear systems with neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">We generalize the leverage score sampling sketch for $\ell_2$-subspace
embeddings, to accommodate sampling subsets of the transformed data, so that
the sketching approach is appropriate for distributed settings. This is then
used to derive an approximate coded computing approach for first-order methods;
known as gradient coding, to accelerate linear regression in the presence of
failures in distributed computational networks, \textit{i.e.} stragglers. We
replicate the data across the distributed network, to attain the approximation
guarantees through the induced sampling distribution. The significance and main
contribution of this work, is that it unifies randomized numerical linear
algebra with approximate coded computing, while attaining an induced
$\ell_2$-subspace embedding through uniform sampling. The transition to uniform
sampling is done without applying a random projection, as in the case of the
subsampled randomized Hadamard transform. Furthermore, by incorporating this
technique to coded computing, our scheme is an iterative sketching approach to
approximately solving linear regression. We also propose weighting when
sketching takes place through sampling with replacement, for further
compression.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised domain adaptation(UDA) and Source-free UDA(SFUDA) methods
formulate the problem involving two domains: source and target. They typically
employ a standard training approach that begins with models pre-trained on
large-scale datasets e.g., ImageNet, while rarely discussing its effect.
Recognizing this gap, we investigate the following research questions: (1) What
is the correlation among ImageNet, the source, and the target domain? (2) How
does pre-training on ImageNet influence the target risk? To answer the first
question, we empirically observed an interesting Spontaneous Pulling (SP)
Effect in fine-tuning where the discrepancies between any two of the three
domains (ImageNet, Source, Target) decrease but at the cost of the impaired
semantic structure of the pre-train domain. For the second question, we put
forward a theory to explain SP and quantify that the target risk is bound by
gradient disparities among the three domains. Our observations reveal a key
limitation of existing methods: it hinders the adaptation performance if the
semantic cluster structure of the pre-train dataset (i.e.ImageNet) is impaired.
To address it, we incorporate ImageNet as the third domain and redefine the
UDA/SFUDA as a three-player game. Specifically, inspired by the theory and
empirical findings, we present a novel framework termed TriDA which
additionally preserves the semantic structure of the pre-train dataset during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various UDA and SFUDA benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we study dialogue scenarios that start from chit-chat but
eventually switch to task-related services, and investigate how a unified
dialogue model, which can engage in both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogues,
takes the initiative during the dialogue mode transition from chit-chat to
task-oriented in a coherent and cooperative manner. We firstly build a
{transition info extractor} (TIE) that keeps track of the preceding chit-chat
interaction and detects the potential user intention to switch to a
task-oriented service. Meanwhile, in the unified model, a {transition sentence
generator} (TSG) is extended through efficient Adapter tuning and transition
prompt learning. When the TIE successfully finds task-related information from
the preceding chit-chat, such as a transition domain, then the TSG is activated
automatically in the unified model to initiate this transition by generating a
transition sentence under the guidance of transition information extracted by
TIE. The experimental results show promising performance regarding the
proactive transitions. We achieve an additional large improvement on TIE model
by utilizing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The TSG can flexibly generate
transition sentences while maintaining the unified capabilities of normal
chit-chat and task-oriented response generation.

<p class="mathjax">Writing a readme is a crucial aspect of software development as it plays a
vital role in managing and reusing program code. Though it is a pain point for
many developers, automatically creating one remains a challenge even with the
recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), because it requires
generating abstract description from thousands of lines of code. In this demo
paper, we show that LLMs are capable of generating a coherent and factually
correct readmes if we can identify a code fragment that is representative of
the repository. Building upon this finding, we developed LARCH (LLM-based
Automatic Readme Creation with Heuristics) which leverages representative code
identification with heuristics and weak supervision. Through human and
automated evaluations, we illustrate that LARCH can generate coherent and
factually correct readmes in the majority of cases, outperforming a baseline
that does not rely on representative code identification. We have made LARCH
open-source and provided a cross-platform Visual Studio Code interface and
command-line interface, accessible at https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/larch . A

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of MDE to adversarial
patches. We propose a novel \underline{S}tealthy \underline{A}dversarial
\underline{A}ttacks on \underline{M}DE (SAAM) that compromises MDE by either
corrupting the estimated distance or causing an object to seamlessly blend into
its surroundings. Our experiments, demonstrate that the designed stealthy patch
successfully causes a DNN-based MDE to misestimate the depth of objects. In
fact, our proposed adversarial patch achieves a significant 60\% depth error
with 99\% ratio of the affected region. Importantly, despite its adversarial
nature, the patch maintains a naturalistic appearance, making it inconspicuous
to human observers. We believe that this work sheds light on the threat of
adversarial attacks in the context of MDE on edge devices. We hope it raises
awareness within the community about the potential real-life harm of such
attacks and encourages further research into developing more robust and
adaptive defense mechanisms.

<p class="mathjax">Code translation aims to convert source code from one programming language
(PL) to another. Given the promising abilities of large language models (LLMs)
in code synthesis, researchers are actively exploring their potential to
automate code translation, i.e., generating code in target PL from its
equivalent in another PL. The pre-requisite for advancing the state of
LLM-based code translation is to understand their limitations. To that end, we
present a large-scale empirical study to investigate the ability of LLMs,
including general LLMs and code LLMs, for code translation across pairs of
different languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our analysis
involves the translation of 1,700 code samples from three distinct benchmarks
and real-world projects, revealing LLMs are yet to be reliably used to automate
code translation -- with incorrect translations ranging from 52.7% to 97.9%
across the studied LLMs. Further manual investigation of unsuccessful
translations among all PLs identifies 14 root causes for translation bugs.
Based on the insights from the empirical study, we propose a prompt-crafting
approach to provide additional context for LLMs, improving the performance of
LLM-based code translation by 5.5% on average across different PLs, LLMs, and
benchmarks. Our study is the first of its kind, in terms of its scale and
breadth, that provides insights into the current limitations of LLMs in code
translation and opportunities for improving them. Our collected extensive
dataset -- consisting of 1,700 code samples written in five PLs with 10K+
tests, 43K+ translated code, 1,725 manually labeled bugs, and 1,365 bug-fix
pairs generated using LLMs -- can help drive research in this area.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we solve inverse problems of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger
equations that can be formulated as a learning process of a special
convolutional neural network. Instead of attempting to approximate functions in
the inverse problems, we embed a library as a low dimensional manifold in the
network such that unknowns can be reduced to some scalars. The nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) is $i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial
t}-\beta\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}+\gamma|\psi|^2\psi+V(x)\psi=0,$
where the wave function $\psi(x,t)$ is the solution to the forward problem and
the potential $V(x)$ is the quantity of interest of the inverse problem. The
main contributions of this work come from two aspects. First, we construct a
special neural network directly from the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which is
motivated by a splitting method. The physics behind the construction enhances
explainability of the neural network. The other part is using a library-search
algorithm to project the solution space of the inverse problem to a
lower-dimensional space. The way to seek the solution in a reduced
approximation space can be traced back to the compressed sensing theory. The
motivation of this part is to alleviate the training burden in estimating
functions. Instead, with a well-chosen library, one can greatly simplify the
training process. A brief analysis is given, which focuses on well-possedness
of some mentioned inverse problems and convergence of the neural network
approximation. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we explore in
some representative problems including simple equations and a couple equation.
The results can well verify the theory part. In the future, we can further
explore manifold learning to enhance the approximation effect of the
library-search algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal recommendation exploits the rich multimodal information associated
with users or items to enhance the representation learning for better
performance. In these methods, end-to-end feature extractors (e.g.,
shallow/deep neural networks) are often adopted to tailor the generic
multimodal features that are extracted from raw data by pre-trained models for
recommendation. However, compact extractors, such as shallow neural networks,
may find it challenging to extract effective information from complex and
high-dimensional generic modality features. Conversely, DNN-based extractors
may encounter the data sparsity problem in recommendation. To address this
problem, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach called Semantic-guided
Feature Distillation (SGFD), which employs a teacher-student framework to
extract feature for multimodal recommendation. The teacher model first extracts
rich modality features from the generic modality feature by considering both
the semantic information of items and the complementary information of multiple
modalities. SGFD then utilizes response-based and feature-based distillation
loss to effectively transfer the knowledge encoded in the teacher model to the
student model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our SGFD, we integrate SGFD
into three backbone multimodal recommendation models. Extensive experiments on
three public real-world datasets demonstrate that SGFD-enhanced models can
achieve substantial improvement over their counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Prompt tuning (PT), a parameter-efficient technique that only tunes the
additional prompt embeddings while keeping the backbone pre-trained language
model (PLM) frozen, has shown promising results in language understanding
tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios. However, effective prompt design
methods suitable for generation tasks such as summarization are still lacking.
At the same time, summarization guided through instructions (discrete prompts)
can achieve a desirable double objective of high quality and controllability in
summary generation. Towards a goal of strong summarization performance under
the triple conditions of parameter-efficiency, data-efficiency, and
controllability, we introduce PromptSum, a method combining PT with a
multi-task objective and discrete entity prompts for abstractive summarization.
Our model achieves competitive ROUGE results on popular abstractive
summarization benchmarks coupled with a strong level of controllability through
entities, all while only tuning several orders of magnitude less parameters.

e-learning technologies. A Quantitative Research Approach was used, gathering
data through a demographic questionnaire and ICT Resources assessment. The
survey measured students' familiarity and knowledge of existing e-learning
technologies. Around 52.50% of respondents were familiar with e learning
concepts, but their exposure and utilization levels need consideration.
Technology, Support, and Users were identified as key factors influencing
student awareness. Implementation can be improved through policies and resource
provision. The researchers recommend integrating e learning policies, providing
ICT Resources and Infrastructure, and offering training for students and

<p class="mathjax">The concept of the federated Cloud-Edge-IoT continuum promises to alleviate
many woes of current systems, improving resource use, energy efficiency,
quality of service, and more. However, this continuum is still far from being
realized in practice, with no comprehensive solutions for developing,
deploying, and managing continuum-native applications. Breakthrough innovations
and novel system architectures are needed to cope with the ever-increasing
heterogeneity and the multi-stakeholder nature of computing resources. This
work proposes a novel architecture for choreographing workloads in the
continuum, attempting to address these challenges. The architecture that
tackles this issue comprehensively, spanning from the workloads themselves,
through networking and data exchange, up to the orchestration and choreography
mechanisms. The concept emphasizes the use of varied AI techniques, enabling
autonomous and intelligent management of resources and workloads. Open
standards are also a key part of the proposition, making it possible to fully
engage third parties in multi-stakeholder scenarios. Although the presented
architecture is promising, much work is required to realize it in practice. To
this end, the key directions for future research are outlined.

<p class="mathjax">Storytelling is the lifeline of the entertainment industry -- movies, TV
shows, and stand-up comedies, all need stories. A good and gripping script is
the lifeline of storytelling and demands creativity and resource investment.
Good scriptwriters are rare to find and often work under severe time pressure.
Consequently, entertainment media are actively looking for automation. In this
paper, we present an AI-based script-writing workbench called KUROSAWA which
addresses the tasks of plot generation and script generation. Plot generation
aims to generate a coherent and creative plot (600-800 words) given a prompt
(15-40 words). Script generation, on the other hand, generates a scene (200-500
words) in a screenplay format from a brief description (15-40 words). Kurosawa
needs data to train. We use a 4-act structure of storytelling to annotate the
plot dataset manually. We create a dataset of 1000 manually annotated plots and
their corresponding prompts/storylines and a gold-standard dataset of 1000
scenes with four main elements -- scene headings, action lines, dialogues, and
character names -- tagged individually. We fine-tune GPT-3 with the above
datasets to generate plots and scenes. These plots and scenes are first
evaluated and then used by the scriptwriters of a large and famous media
platform ErosNow. We release the annotated datasets and the models trained on
these datasets as a working benchmark for automatic movie plot and script
generation.

<p class="mathjax">WebAssembly (Wasm) is an emerging binary format that draws great attention
from our community. However, Wasm binaries are weakly protected, as they can be
read, edited, and manipulated by adversaries using either the officially
provided readable text format (i.e., wat) or some advanced binary analysis
tools. Reverse engineering of Wasm binaries is often used for nefarious
intentions, e.g., identifying and exploiting both classic vulnerabilities and
Wasm specific vulnerabilities exposed in the binaries. However, no
Wasm-specific obfuscator is available in our community to secure the Wasm
binaries. To fill the gap, in this paper, we present WASMixer, the first
general-purpose Wasm binary obfuscator, enforcing data-level (string literals
and function names) and code-level (control flow and instructions) obfuscation
for Wasm binaries. We propose a series of key techniques to overcome challenges
during Wasm binary rewriting, including an on-demand decryption method to
minimize the impact brought by decrypting the data in memory area, and code
splitting/reconstructing algorithms to handle structured control flow in Wasm.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness and efficiency
of WASMixer. Our research has shed light on the promising direction of Wasm
binary research, including Wasm code protection, Wasm binary diversification,
and the attack-defense arm race of Wasm binaries.

"winning tickets", can achieve performance comparable to the full model. A key
process in LTH, Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP), incrementally eliminates
minimal weights, emulating stepwise learning in DNNs. Once we identify these
winning tickets, we further investigate their "universality". In other words,
we check if a winning ticket that works well for one specific problem could
also work well for other, similar problems. We also bridge the divide between
the IMP and the Renormalisation Group (RG) theory in physics, promoting a more
rigorous understanding of IMP.

<p class="mathjax">N-gram matching-based evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and chrF, are widely
utilized across a range of natural language generation (NLG) tasks. However,
recent studies have revealed a weak correlation between these matching-based
metrics and human evaluations, especially when compared with neural-based
metrics like BLEURT. In this paper, we conjecture that the performance
bottleneck in matching-based metrics may be caused by the limited diversity of
references. To address this issue, we propose to utilize \textit{multiple
references} to enhance the consistency between these metrics and human
evaluations. Within the WMT Metrics benchmarks, we observe that the
multi-references F200spBLEU surpasses the conventional single-reference one by
an accuracy improvement of 7.2\%. Remarkably, it also exceeds the neural-based
BERTscore by an accuracy enhancement of 3.9\%. Moreover, we observe that the
data leakage issue in large language models (LLMs) can be mitigated to a large
extent by our multi-reference metric. We release the code and data at

<p class="mathjax">Contrasting Language-image pertaining (CLIP) has recently shown promising
open-world and few-shot performance on 2D image-based recognition tasks.
However, the transferred capability of CLIP to the novel event camera data
still remains under-explored. In particular, due to the modality gap with the
image-text data and the lack of large-scale datasets, achieving this goal is
non-trivial and thus requires significant research innovation. In this paper,
we propose E-CLIP, a novel and effective framework that unleashes the potential
of CLIP for event-based recognition to compensate for the lack of large-scale
event-based datasets. Our work addresses two crucial challenges: 1) how to
generalize CLIP's visual encoder to event data while fully leveraging events'
unique properties, e.g., sparsity and high temporal resolution; 2) how to
effectively align the multi-modal embeddings, i.e., image, text, and events. To
this end, we first introduce a novel event encoder that subtly models the
temporal information from events and meanwhile generates event prompts to
promote the modality bridging. We then design a text encoder that generates
content prompts and utilizes hybrid text prompts to enhance the E-CLIP's
generalization ability across diverse datasets. With the proposed event
encoder, text encoder, and original image encoder, a novel Hierarchical Triple
Contrastive Alignment (HTCA) module is introduced to jointly optimize the
correlation and enable efficient knowledge transfer among the three modalities.
We conduct extensive experiments on two recognition benchmarks, and the results
demonstrate that our E-CLIP outperforms existing methods by a large margin of
+3.94% and +4.62% on the N-Caltech dataset, respectively, in both fine-tuning
and few-shot settings. Moreover, our E-CLIP can be flexibly extended to the
event retrieval task using both text or image queries, showing plausible
performance.

<p class="mathjax">A common approach to solve inverse imaging problems relies on finding a
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the original unknown image, by solving a
minimization problem. In thiscontext, iterative proximal algorithms are widely
used, enabling to handle non-smooth functions and linear operators. Recently,
these algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further
improve the estimate quality. In particular, proximal neural networks (PNNs)
have been introduced, obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding
a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear
operators and parameters. As PNNs are based on optimization theory, they are
very flexible, and can be adapted to any image restoration task, as soon as a
proximal algorithm can solve it. They further have much lighter architectures
than traditional networks. In this article we propose a unified framework to
build PNNs for the Gaussian denoising task, based on both the dual-FB and the
primal-dual Chambolle-Pock algorithms. We further show that accelerated
inertial versions of these algorithms enable skip connections in the associated
NN layers. We propose different learning strategies for our PNN framework, and
investigate their robustness (Lipschitz property) and denoising efficiency.
Finally, we assess the robustness of our PNNs when plugged in a
forward-backward algorithm for an image deblurring problem.

<p class="mathjax">In online classification, a learner is presented with a sequence of examples
and aims to predict their labels in an online fashion so as to minimize the
total number of mistakes. In the self-directed variant, the learner knows in
advance the pool of examples and can adaptively choose the order in which
predictions are made. Here we study the power of choosing the prediction order
and establish the first strong separation between worst-order and random-order
learning for the fundamental task of linear classification. Prior to our work,
such a separation was known only for very restricted concept classes, e.g.,
one-dimensional thresholds or axis-aligned rectangles.
<br />We present two main results. If $X$ is a dataset of $n$ points drawn
uniformly at random from the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, we design an
efficient self-directed learner that makes $O(d \log \log(n))$ mistakes and
classifies the entire dataset. If $X$ is an arbitrary $d$-dimensional dataset
of size $n$, we design an efficient self-directed learner that predicts the
labels of $99\%$ of the points in $X$ with mistake bound independent of $n$. In
contrast, under a worst- or random-ordering, the number of mistakes must be at
least $\Omega(d \log n)$, even when the points are drawn uniformly from the
unit sphere and the learner only needs to predict the labels for $1\%$ of them.

<p class="mathjax">The development of artificial agents for social interaction pushes to enrich
robots with social skills and knowledge about (local) social norms. One
possibility is to distinguish the expressive and the functional orders during a
human-robot interaction. The overarching aim of this work is to set a framework
to make the artificial agent socially-competent beyond dyadic
interaction-interaction in varying multi-party social situations-and beyond
individual-based user personalization, thereby enlarging the current conception
of "culturally-adaptive". The core idea is to provide the artificial agent with
the capability to handle different kinds of interactional disruptions, and
associated recovery strategies, in microsociology. The result is obtained by
classifying functional and social disruptions, and by investigating the
requirements a robot's architecture should satisfy to exploit such knowledge.
The paper also highlights how this level of competence is achieved by focusing
on just three dimensions: (i) social capability, (ii) relational role, and
(iii) proximity, leaving aside the further complexity of full-fledged
human-human interactions. Without going into technical aspects, End-to-end
Data-driven Architectures and Modular Architectures are discussed to evaluate
the degree to which they can exploit this new set of social and cultural
knowledge. Finally, a list of general requirements for such agents is proposed.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rise of 5G
communication networks and automatic driving, millimeter wave (mmWave) sensing
is emerging and starts impacting our life and workspace. mmWave sensing can
sense humans and objects in a contactless way, providing fine-grained sensing
ability. In the past few years, many mmWave sensing techniques have been
proposed and applied in various human sensing applications (e.g., human
localization, gesture recognition, and vital monitoring). We discover the need
of a comprehensive survey to summarize the technology, platforms and
applications of mmWave-based human sensing. In this survey, we first present
the mmWave hardware platforms and some key techniques of mmWave sensing. We
then provide a comprehensive review of existing mmWave-based human sensing
works. Specifically, we divide existing works into four categories according to
the sensing granularity: human tracking and localization, motion recognition,
biometric measurement and human imaging. Finally, we discuss the potential
research challenges and present future directions in this area.

<p class="mathjax">Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the task of identifying the emotion
expressed in a spoken utterance. Emotion recognition is essential in building
robust conversational agents in domains such as law, healthcare, education, and
customer support. Most of the studies published on SER use datasets created by
employing professional actors in a noise-free environment. In natural settings
such as a customer care conversation, the audio is often noisy with speakers
regularly switching between different languages as they see fit. We have worked
in collaboration with a leading unicorn in the Conversational AI sector to
develop Natural Speech Emotion Dataset (NSED). NSED is a natural code-mixed
speech emotion dataset where each utterance in a conversation is annotated with
emotion, sentiment, valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) values. In this
paper, we show that by incorporating word-level VAD value we improve on the
task of SER by 2%, for negative emotions, over the baseline value for NSED.
High accuracy for negative emotion recognition is essential because customers
expressing negative opinions/views need to be pacified with urgency, lest
complaints and dissatisfaction snowball and get out of hand. Escalation of
negative opinions speedily is crucial for business interests. Our study then
can be utilized to develop conversational agents which are more polite and
empathetic in such situations.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive performance in
substantial downstream multi-modal tasks. However, only comparing the
fine-tuned performance on downstream tasks leads to the poor interpretability
of VLMs, which is adverse to their future improvement. Several prior works have
identified this issue and used various probing methods under a zero-shot
setting to detect VLMs' limitations, but they all examine VLMs using general
datasets instead of specialized ones. In practical applications, VLMs are
usually applied to specific scenarios, such as e-commerce and news fields, so
the generalization of VLMs in specific domains should be given more attention.
In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the capabilities of popular VLMs
in a specific field, the food domain. To this end, we build a food caption
dataset, Food-500 Cap, which contains 24,700 food images with 494 categories.
Each image is accompanied by a detailed caption, including fine-grained
attributes of food, such as the ingredient, shape, and color. We also provide a
culinary culture taxonomy that classifies each food category based on its
geographic origin in order to better analyze the performance differences of VLM
in different regions. Experiments on our proposed datasets demonstrate that
popular VLMs underperform in the food domain compared with their performance in
the general domain. Furthermore, our research reveals severe bias in VLMs'
ability to handle food items from different geographic regions. We adopt
diverse probing methods and evaluate nine VLMs belonging to different
architectures to verify the aforementioned observations. We hope that our study
will bring researchers' attention to VLM's limitations when applying them to
the domain of food or culinary cultures, and spur further investigations to
address this issue.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we make the first attempt at
studying the parametric semilinear elliptic eigenvalue problems with the
parametric coefficient and some power-type nonlinearities. The parametric
coefficient is assumed to have an affine dependence on the countably many
parameters with an appropriate class of sequences of functions. In this paper,
we obtain the upper bound estimation for the mixed derivatives of the ground
eigenpairs that has the same form obtained recently for the linear eigenvalue
problem. The three most essential ingredients for this estimation are the
parametric analyticity of the ground eigenpairs, the uniform boundedness of the
ground eigenpairs, and the uniform positive differences between ground
eigenvalues of linear operators. All these three ingredients need new
techniques and a careful investigation of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem that
will be presented in this paper. As an application, considering each parameter
as a uniformly distributed random variable, we estimate the expectation of the
eigenpairs using a randomly shifted quasi-Monte Carlo lattice rule and show the
dimension-independent error bound.

propose new high-fidelity metrics to quantify the difference between
explanations of the investigated XAI method and those derived from the
synthetic model. Our metrics allow assessment of explanations in terms of
precision and recall separately. Also, we propose metrics to independently
evaluate negative or positive contributions of inputs. Our proposal provides
deeper insights into XAI methods output. We investigate our proposal by
constructing a synthetic convolutional image classification model and
benchmarking several widely used XAI attribution methods using our evaluation
approach. We compare our results with established prior XAI evaluation metrics.
By deriving the ground truth directly from the constructed model in our method,
we ensure the absence of bias, e.g., subjective either based on the training
set. Our experimental results provide novel insights into the performance of
Guided-Backprop and Smoothgrad XAI methods that are widely in use. Both have
good precision and recall scores among positively contributing pixels (0.7,
0.76 and 0.7, 0.77, respectively), but poor precision scores among negatively
contributing pixels (0.44, 0.61 and 0.47, 0.75, resp.). The recall scores in
the latter case remain close. We show that our metrics are among the fastest in
terms of execution time.

<p class="mathjax">Decision-based black-box attacks often necessitate a large number of queries
to craft an adversarial example. Moreover, decision-based attacks based on
querying boundary points in the estimated normal vector direction often suffer
from inefficiency and convergence issues. In this paper, we propose a novel
query-efficient curvature-aware geometric decision-based black-box attack
(CGBA) that conducts boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted
2D plane to ensure finding a boundary point successfully irrespective of the
boundary curvature. While the proposed CGBA attack can work effectively for an
arbitrary decision boundary, it is particularly efficient in exploiting the low
curvature to craft high-quality adversarial examples, which is widely seen and
experimentally verified in commonly used classifiers under non-targeted
attacks. In contrast, the decision boundaries often exhibit higher curvature
under targeted attacks. Thus, we develop a new query-efficient variant, CGBA-H,
that is adapted for the targeted attack. In addition, we further design an
algorithm to obtain a better initial boundary point at the expense of some
extra queries, which considerably enhances the performance of the targeted
attack. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our
proposed methods against some well-known classifiers on the ImageNet and
CIFAR10 datasets, demonstrating the superiority of CGBA and CGBA-H over
state-of-the-art non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively. The source
code is available at https://github.com/Farhamdur/CGBA.

<p class="mathjax">Metaverse provides users with a novel experience through immersive multimedia
technologies. Along with the rapid user growth, numerous events bursting in the
metaverse necessitate an announcer to help catch and monitor ongoing events.
However, systems on the market primarily serve for esports competitions and
rely on human directors, making it challenging to provide 24-hour delivery in
the metaverse persistent world. To fill the blank, we proposed a three-stage
architecture for metaverse announcers, which is designed to identify events,
position cameras, and blend between shots. Based on the architecture, we
introduced a Metaverse Announcer User Experience (MAUE) model to identify the
factors affecting the users' Quality of Experience (QoE) from a human-centered
perspective. In addition, we implemented \textit{MetaCast}, a practical
self-driven metaverse announcer in a university campus metaverse prototype, to
conduct user studies for MAUE model. The experimental results have effectively
achieved satisfactory announcer settings that align with the preferences of
most users, encompassing parameters such as video transition rate, repetition
rate, importance threshold value, and image composition.

<p class="mathjax">Camouflaged object detection (COD) is the challenging task of identifying
camouflaged objects visually blended into surroundings. Albeit achieving
remarkable success, existing COD detectors still struggle to obtain precise
results in some challenging cases. To handle this problem, we draw inspiration
from the prey-vs-predator game that leads preys to develop better camouflage
and predators to acquire more acute vision systems and develop algorithms from
both the prey side and the predator side. On the prey side, we propose an
adversarial training framework, Camouflageator, which introduces an auxiliary
generator to generate more camouflaged objects that are harder for a COD method
to detect. Camouflageator trains the generator and detector in an adversarial
way such that the enhanced auxiliary generator helps produce a stronger
detector. On the predator side, we introduce a novel COD method, called
Internal Coherence and Edge Guidance (ICEG), which introduces a camouflaged
feature coherence module to excavate the internal coherence of camouflaged
objects, striving to obtain more complete segmentation results. Additionally,
ICEG proposes a novel edge-guided separated calibration module to remove false
predictions to avoid obtaining ambiguous boundaries. Extensive experiments show
that ICEG outperforms existing COD detectors and Camouflageator is flexible to
improve various COD detectors, including ICEG, which brings state-of-the-art
COD performance.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series is a major problem in many
fields. Due to their nature, anomalies sparsely occur in real data, thus making
the task of anomaly detection a challenging problem for classification
algorithms to solve. Methods that are based on Deep Neural Networks such as
LSTM, Autoencoders, Convolutional Autoencoders etc., have shown positive
results in such imbalanced data. However, the major challenge that algorithms
face when applied to multivariate time series is that the anomaly can arise
from a small subset of the feature set. To boost the performance of these base
models, we propose a feature-bagging technique that considers only a subset of
features at a time, and we further apply a transformation that is based on
nested rotation computed from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve the
effectiveness and generalization of the approach. To further enhance the
prediction performance, we propose an ensemble technique that combines multiple
base models toward the final decision. In addition, a semi-supervised approach
using a Logistic Regressor to combine the base models' outputs is proposed. The
proposed methodology is applied to the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB)
dataset, which contains time series data related to the flow of water in a
closed circuit, and the experimental results show that the proposed ensemble
technique outperforms the basic algorithms. More specifically, the performance
improvement in terms of anomaly detection accuracy reaches 2% for the
unsupervised and at least 10% for the semi-supervised models.

<p class="mathjax">Proper confidence calibration of deep neural networks is essential for
reliable predictions in safety-critical tasks. Miscalibration can lead to model
over-confidence and/or under-confidence; i.e., the model's confidence in its
prediction can be greater or less than the model's accuracy. Recent studies
have highlighted the over-confidence issue by introducing calibration
techniques and demonstrated success on various tasks. However, miscalibration
through under-confidence has not yet to receive much attention. In this paper,
we address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue. We
first introduce a novel metric, a miscalibration score, to identify the overall
and class-wise calibration status, including being over or under-confident. Our
proposed metric reveals the pitfalls of existing calibration techniques, where
they often overly calibrate the model and worsen under-confident predictions.
Then we utilize the class-wise miscalibration score as a proxy to design a
calibration technique that can tackle both over and under-confidence. We report
extensive experiments that show our proposed methods substantially
outperforming existing calibration techniques. We also validate our proposed
calibration technique on an automatic failure detection task with a
risk-coverage curve, reporting that our methods improve failure detection as
well as trustworthiness of the model. The code are available at
\url{https://github.com/AoShuang92/miscalibration_TS}.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) has shown great promise for revolutionizing a number of
areas, including healthcare. However, it is also facing a reproducibility
crisis, especially in medicine. ML models that are carefully constructed from
and evaluated on a training set might not generalize well on data from
different patient populations or acquisition instrument settings and protocols.
We tackle this problem in the context of neuroimaging of Alzheimer's disease
(AD), schizophrenia (SZ) and brain aging. We develop a weighted empirical risk
minimization approach that optimally combines data from a source group, e.g.,
subjects are stratified by attributes such as sex, age group, race and clinical
cohort to make predictions on a target group, e.g., other sex, age group, etc.
using a small fraction (10%) of data from the target group. We apply this
method to multi-source data of 15,363 individuals from 20 neuroimaging studies
to build ML models for diagnosis of AD and SZ, and estimation of brain age. We
found that this approach achieves substantially better accuracy than existing
domain adaptation techniques: it obtains area under curve greater than 0.95 for
AD classification, area under curve greater than 0.7 for SZ classification and
mean absolute error less than 5 years for brain age prediction on all target
groups, achieving robustness to variations of scanners, protocols, and
demographic or clinical characteristics. In some cases, it is even better than
training on all data from the target group, because it leverages the diversity
and size of a larger training set. We also demonstrate the utility of our
models for prognostic tasks such as predicting disease progression in
individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Critically, our brain age
prediction models lead to new clinical insights regarding correlations with
neurophysiological tests.

<p class="mathjax">Although AI systems have been applied in various fields and achieved
impressive performance, their safety and reliability are still a big concern.
This is especially important for safety-critical tasks. One shared
characteristic of these critical tasks is their risk sensitivity, where small
mistakes can cause big consequences and even endanger life. There are several
factors that could be guidelines for the successful deployment of AI systems in
sensitive tasks: (i) failure detection and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection;
(ii) overfitting identification; (iii) uncertainty quantification for
predictions; (iv) robustness to data perturbations. These factors are also
challenges of current AI systems, which are major blocks for building safe and
reliable AI. Specifically, the current AI algorithms are unable to identify
common causes for failure detection. Furthermore, additional techniques are
required to quantify the quality of predictions. All these contribute to
inaccurate uncertainty quantification, which lowers trust in predictions. Hence
obtaining accurate model uncertainty quantification and its further improvement
are challenging. To address these issues, many techniques have been proposed,
such as regularization methods and learning strategies. As vision and language
are the most typical data type and have many open source benchmark datasets,
this thesis will focus on vision-language data processing for tasks like
classification, image captioning, and vision question answering. In this
thesis, we aim to build a safeguard by further developing current techniques to
ensure the accurate model uncertainty for safety-critical tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Although extensive research has been conducted on 3D point cloud
segmentation, effectively adapting generic models to novel categories remains a
formidable challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve point
cloud few-shot segmentation (PC-FSS) models. Unlike existing PC-FSS methods
that directly utilize categorical information from support prototypes to
recognize novel classes in query samples, our method identifies two critical
aspects that substantially enhance model performance by reducing contextual
gaps between support prototypes and query features. Specifically, we (1) adapt
support background prototypes to match query context while removing extraneous
cues that may obscure foreground and background in query samples, and (2)
holistically rectify support prototypes under the guidance of query features to
emulate the latter having no semantic gap to the query targets. Our proposed
designs are agnostic to the feature extractor, rendering them readily
applicable to any prototype-based methods. The experimental results on S3DIS
and ScanNet demonstrate notable practical benefits, as our approach achieves
significant improvements while still maintaining high efficiency. The code for
our approach is available at

<p class="mathjax">Failure detection (FD) in AI systems is a crucial safeguard for the
deployment for safety-critical tasks. The common evaluation method of FD
performance is the Risk-coverage (RC) curve, which reveals the trade-off
between the data coverage rate and the performance on accepted data. One common
way to quantify the RC curve by calculating the area under the RC curve.
However, this metric does not inform on how suited any method is for FD, or
what the optimal coverage rate should be. As FD aims to achieve higher
performance with fewer data discarded, evaluating with partial coverage
excluding the most uncertain samples is more intuitive and meaningful than full
coverage. In addition, there is an optimal point in the coverage where the
model could achieve ideal performance theoretically. We propose the Excess Area
Under the Optimal RC Curve (E-AUoptRC), with the area in coverage from the
optimal point to the full coverage. Further, the model performance at this
optimal point can represent both model learning ability and calibration. We
propose it as the Trust Index (TI), a complementary evaluation metric to the
overall model accuracy. We report extensive experiments on three benchmark
image datasets with ten variants of transformer and CNN models. Our results
show that our proposed methods can better reflect the model trustworthiness
than existing evaluation metrics. We further observe that the model with high
overall accuracy does not always yield the high TI, which indicates the
necessity of the proposed Trust Index as a complementary metric to the model
overall accuracy. The code are available at

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of scaling up optimal and safe controllers for
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) from a single Control Zone (CZ) around
a traffic conflict area to an entire network. The goal is to jointly minimize
travel time and energy consumption for all CAVs, while providing
speed-dependent safety guarantees within a CZ and satisfying velocity and
acceleration constraints. A hierarchical modular CZ framework is developed
consisting of a lower level where decentralized controllers are used that
combine Optimal control and Control Barrier Functions (OCBF) and a higher level
where a feedback flow controller is proposed to coordinate adjacent CZs. The
flow controller is parameterized by a terminal velocity constraint that serves
as the interface between CZs. Simulation results show that the proposed modular
control zone framework outperforms a direct extension of the OCBF framework to
multiple CZs without any flow control.

area relative to the vast and rapidly growing literature for image-to-image

<p class="mathjax">Data-driven approaches have been proven effective in solving combinatorial
optimization problems over graphs such as the traveling salesman problems and
the vehicle routing problem. The rationale behind such methods is that the
input instances may follow distributions with salient patterns that can be
leveraged to overcome the worst-case computational hardness. For optimization
problems over graphs, the common practice of neural combinatorial solvers
consumes the inputs in the form of adjacency matrices. In this paper, we
explore a vision-based method that is conceptually novel: can neural models
solve graph optimization problems by \textit{taking a look at the graph
pattern}? Our results suggest that the performance of such vision-based methods
is not only non-trivial but also comparable to the state-of-the-art
matrix-based methods, which opens a new avenue for developing data-driven
optimization solvers.

<p class="mathjax">Most Recommender Systems (RecSys) do not provide an indication of confidence
in their decisions. Therefore, they do not distinguish between recommendations
of which they are certain, and those where they are not. Existing confidence
methods for RecSys are either inaccurate heuristics, conceptually complex or
computationally very expensive. Consequently, real-world RecSys applications
rarely adopt these methods, and thus, provide no confidence insights in their
behavior. In this work, we propose learned beta distributions (LBD) as a simple
and practical recommendation method with an explicit measure of confidence. Our
main insight is that beta distributions predict user preferences as probability
distributions that naturally model confidence on a closed interval, yet can be
implemented with the minimal model-complexity. Our results show that LBD
maintains competitive accuracy to existing methods while also having a
significantly stronger correlation between its accuracy and confidence.
Furthermore, LBD has higher performance when applied to a high-precision
targeted recommendation task. Our work thus shows that confidence in RecSys is
possible without sacrificing simplicity or accuracy, and without introducing
heavy computational complexity. Thereby, we hope it enables better insight into
real-world RecSys and opens the door for novel future applications.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide array of NLP tasks. However, their efficacy is undermined by undesired
and inconsistent behaviors, including hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and
toxic content. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is self-correction,
where the LLM itself is prompted or guided to fix problems in its own output.
Techniques leveraging automated feedback -- either produced by the LLM itself
or some external system -- are of particular interest as they are a promising
way to make LLM-based solutions more practical and deployable with minimal
human feedback. This paper presents a comprehensive review of this emerging
class of techniques. We analyze and taxonomize a wide array of recent work
utilizing these strategies, including training-time, generation-time, and
post-hoc correction. We also summarize the major applications of this strategy
and conclude by discussing future directions and challenges.

<p class="mathjax">The numbers of persons who can be enrolled by their iris patterns with no
identity collisions is studied in relation to the biometric entropy extracted,
and the decision operating threshold. The population size at which identity
collision becomes likelier than not, given those variables, defines iris
"capacity." The general solution to this combinatorial problem is derived, in
analogy with the well-known "birthday problem." Its application to unique
biometric identification on national population scales is shown, referencing
empirical data from US NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
trials involving 1.2 trillion (1.2 x 10^(12) ) iris comparisons. The entropy of
a given person's two iris patterns suffices for global identity uniqueness.

<p class="mathjax">Communication strongly influences attitudes on climate change. Within
sponsored communication, high spend and high reach advertising dominates. In
the advertising ecosystem we can distinguish actors with adversarial stances:
organizations with contrarian or advocacy communication goals, who direct the
advertisement delivery algorithm to launch ads in different destinations by
specifying targets and campaign objectives. We present an observational
(N=275,632) and a controlled (N=650) study which collectively indicate that the
advertising delivery algorithm could itself be an actor, asserting
statistically significant influence over advertisement destinations,
characterized by U.S. state, gender type, or age range. This algorithmic
behaviour may not entirely be understood by the advertising platform (and its
creators). These findings have implications for climate communications and
misinformation research, revealing that targeting intentions are not always
fulfilled as requested and that delivery itself could be manipulated.

<p class="mathjax">Safety and efficiency are paramount in healthcare facilities where the lives
of patients are at stake. Despite the adoption of robots to assist medical
staff in challenging tasks such as complex surgeries, human expertise is still
indispensable. The next generation of autonomous healthcare robots hinges on
their capacity to perceive and understand their complex and frenetic
environments. While deep learning models are increasingly used for this
purpose, they require extensive annotated training data which is impractical to
obtain in real-world healthcare settings. To bridge this gap, we present
Syn-Mediverse, the first hyper-realistic multimodal synthetic dataset of
diverse healthcare facilities. Syn-Mediverse contains over \num{48000} images
from a simulated industry-standard optical tracking camera and provides more
than 1.5M annotations spanning five different scene understanding tasks
including depth estimation, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance
segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. We demonstrate the complexity of our
dataset by evaluating the performance on a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines for each task. To further advance research on scene understanding of
healthcare facilities, along with the public dataset we provide an online
evaluation benchmark available at \url{<a href="http://syn-mediverse.cs.uni-freiburg.de">this http URL</a>}

<p class="mathjax">The prevalence and mobility of smartphones make these a widely used tool for
environmental health research. However, their potential for determining
aggregated air quality index (AQI) based on PM2.5 concentration in specific
locations remains largely unexplored in the existing literature. In this paper,
we thoroughly examine the challenges associated with predicting
location-specific PM2.5 concentration using images taken with smartphone
cameras. The focus of our study is on Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, due to
its significant air pollution levels and the large population exposed to it.
Our research involves the development of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network
(DCNN), which we train using over a thousand outdoor images taken and
annotated. These photos are captured at various locations in Dhaka, and their
labels are based on PM2.5 concentration data obtained from the local US
consulate, calculated using the NowCast algorithm. Through supervised learning,
our model establishes a correlation index during training, enhancing its
ability to function as a Picture-based Predictor of PM2.5 Concentration (PPPC).
This enables the algorithm to calculate an equivalent daily averaged AQI index
from a smartphone image. Unlike, popular overly parameterized models, our model
shows resource efficiency since it uses fewer parameters. Furthermore, test
results indicate that our model outperforms popular models like ViT and INN, as
well as popular CNN-based models such as VGG19, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2, in
predicting location-specific PM2.5 concentration. Our dataset is the first
publicly available collection that includes atmospheric images and
corresponding PM2.5 measurements from Dhaka. Our code and dataset will be made
public when publishing the paper.

<p class="mathjax">Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is widely used in various fields, including
motion analysis, healthcare, and virtual reality. However, the great expenses
of labeled real-world datasets present a significant challenge for HPE. To
overcome this, one approach is to train HPE models on synthetic datasets and
then perform domain adaptation (DA) on real-world data. Unfortunately, existing
DA methods for HPE neglect data privacy and security by using both source and
target data in the adaptation process.
<br />To this end, we propose a new task, named source-free domain adaptive HPE,
which aims to address the challenges of cross-domain learning of HPE without
access to source data during the adaptation process. We further propose a novel
framework that consists of three models: source model, intermediate model, and
target model, which explores the task from both source-protect and
target-relevant perspectives. The source-protect module preserves source
information more effectively while resisting noise, and the target-relevant
module reduces the sparsity of spatial representations by building a novel
spatial probability space, and pose-specific contrastive learning and
information maximization are proposed on the basis of this space. Comprehensive
experiments on several domain adaptive HPE benchmarks show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches by a considerable margin.

<p class="mathjax">The safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) depends on their ability to perform
complex computations on high-volume sensor data in a timely manner. Their
ability to run these computations with state-of-the-art models is limited by
the processing power and slow update cycles of their onboard hardware. In
contrast, cloud computing offers the ability to burst computation to vast
amounts of the latest generation of hardware. However, accessing these cloud
resources requires traversing wireless networks that are often considered to be
too unreliable for real-time AV driving applications.
<br />Our work seeks to harness this unreliable cloud to enhance the accuracy of an
AV's decisions, while ensuring that it can always fall back to its on-board
computational capabilities. We identify three mechanisms that can be used by
AVs to safely leverage the cloud for accuracy enhancements, and elaborate why
current execution systems fail to enable these mechanisms. To address these
limitations, we provide a system design based on the speculative execution of
an AV's pipeline in the cloud, and show the efficacy of this approach in
simulations of complex real-world scenarios that apply these mechanisms.

the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2023)
in London, UK and continued to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art
autonomous ground navigation systems in highly constrained environments.
Compared to The 1st BARN Challenge at ICRA 2022 in Philadelphia, the
competition has grown significantly in size, doubling the numbers of
participants in both the simulation qualifier and physical finals: Ten teams
from all over the world participated in the qualifying simulation competition,
six of which were invited to compete with each other in three physical obstacle
courses at the conference center in London, and three teams won the challenge
by navigating a Clearpath Jackal robot from a predefined start to a goal with
the shortest amount of time without colliding with any obstacle. The
competition results, compared to last year, suggest that the teams are making
progress toward more robust and efficient ground navigation systems that work
out-of-the-box in many obstacle environments. However, a significant amount of
fine-tuning is still needed onsite to cater to different difficult navigation
scenarios. Furthermore, challenges still remain for many teams when facing
extremely cluttered obstacles and increasing navigation speed. In this article,
we discuss the challenge, the approaches used by the three winning teams, and
lessons learned to direct future research.

<p class="mathjax">Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on real-world graphs consisting of
billions of nodes and edges is quite challenging, primarily due to the
substantial memory needed to store the graph and its intermediate node and edge
features, and there is a pressing need to speed up the training process. A
common approach to achieve speed up is to divide the graph into many smaller
subgraphs, which are then distributed across multiple GPUs in one or more
machines and processed in parallel. However, existing distributed methods
require frequent and substantial cross-GPU communication, leading to
significant time overhead and progressively diminishing scalability. Here, we
introduce CoFree-GNN, a novel distributed GNN training framework that
significantly speeds up the training process by implementing communication-free
training. The framework utilizes a Vertex Cut partitioning, i.e., rather than
partitioning the graph by cutting the edges between partitions, the Vertex Cut
partitions the edges and duplicates the node information to preserve the graph
structure. Furthermore, the framework maintains high model accuracy by
incorporating a reweighting mechanism to handle a distorted graph distribution
that arises from the duplicated nodes. We also propose a modified DropEdge
technique to further speed up the training process. Using an extensive set of
experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate that CoFree-GNN speeds up
the GNN training process by up to 10 times over the existing state-of-the-art
GNN training approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in several
application domains, leading to sparse, not fully-observed and non-aligned
observations across different variables. Standard sequential neural network
architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times,
posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of
the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time
intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in
the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional
layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions
of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can
be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus,
propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which
shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed
for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation
and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate
time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive
performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more
efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed
architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the
combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in
subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this
field.

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have emerged as a widely used neural network model for various
natural language processing tasks. Previous research explored their
relationship with constant-depth threshold circuits, making two assumptions:
average-hard attention and logarithmic precision for internal computations
relative to input length. Merrill et al. (2022) prove that average-hard
attention transformers recognize languages that fall within the complexity
class TC0, denoting the set of languages that can be recognized by
constant-depth polynomial-size threshold circuits. Likewise, Merrill and
Sabharwal (2023) show that log-precision transformers recognize languages
within the class of uniform TC0. This shows that both transformer models can be
simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits, with the latter being more
robust due to generating a uniform circuit family. Our paper shows that the
first result can be extended to yield uniform circuits as well.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies of two-view correspondence learning usually establish an
end-to-end network to jointly predict correspondence reliability and relative
pose. We improve such a framework from two aspects. First, we propose a Local
Feature Consensus (LFC) plugin block to augment the features of existing
models. Given a correspondence feature, the block augments its neighboring
features with mutual neighborhood consensus and aggregates them to produce an
enhanced feature. As inliers obey a uniform cross-view transformation and share
more consistent learned features than outliers, feature consensus strengthens
inlier correlation and suppresses outlier distraction, which makes output
features more discriminative for classifying inliers/outliers. Second, existing
approaches supervise network training with the ground truth correspondences and
essential matrix projecting one image to the other for an input image pair,
without considering the information from the reverse mapping. We extend
existing models to a Siamese network with a reciprocal loss that exploits the
supervision of mutual projection, which considerably promotes the matching
performance without introducing additional model parameters. Building upon
MSA-Net, we implement the two proposals and experimentally achieve
state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

which collaborative robots need to perform industrial tasks with human
co-workers. We develop three independent modules to account for safety in
different types of human-robot interaction: vision-based safety monitoring
pauses robot when human is present in a shared space; contact-based safety
monitoring pauses robot when unexpected contact happens between human and
robot; hierarchical intention tracking keeps robot in a safe distance from
human when human and robot work independently, and switches robot to compliant
mode when human intends to guide robot. We discuss the prospect of future
research in development and integration of multi-level safety modules. We focus
on how to provide safety guarantees for collaborative robot solutions with

<p class="mathjax">This paper derives a discrete dual problem for a prototypical hybrid
high-order method for convex minimization problems. The discrete primal and
dual problem satisfy a weak convex duality that leads to a priori error
estimates with convergence rates under additional smoothness assumptions. This
duality holds for general polytopal meshes and arbitrary polynomial degree of
the discretization. A nouvelle postprocessing is proposed and allows for
a~posteriori error estimates on simplicial meshes using primal-dual techniques.
This motivates an adaptive mesh-refining algorithm, which performs superiorly
compared to uniform mesh refinements.

<p class="mathjax">We present a critical assessment of Piantadosi's (2023) claim that "Modern
language models refute Chomsky's approach to language," focusing on four main
points. First, despite the impressive performance and utility of large language
models (LLMs), humans achieve their capacity for language after exposure to
several orders of magnitude less data. The fact that young children become
competent, fluent speakers of their native languages with relatively little
exposure to them is the central mystery of language learning to which Chomsky
initially drew attention, and LLMs currently show little promise of solving
this mystery. Second, what can the artificial reveal about the natural? Put
simply, the implications of LLMs for our understanding of the cognitive
structures and mechanisms underlying language and its acquisition are like the
implications of airplanes for understanding how birds fly. Third, LLMs cannot
constitute scientific theories of language for several reasons, not least of
which is that scientific theories must provide interpretable explanations, not
just predictions. This leads to our final point: to even determine whether the
linguistic and cognitive capabilities of LLMs rival those of humans requires
explicating what humans' capacities actually are. In other words, it requires a
separate theory of language and cognition; generative linguistics provides
precisely such a theory. As such, we conclude that generative linguistics as a
scientific discipline will remain indispensable throughout the 21st century and
beyond.

<p class="mathjax">Packing is a required step in a typical FPGA CAD flow. It has high impacts to
the performance of FPGA placement and routing. Early prediction of packing
results can guide design optimization and expedite design closure. In this
work, we propose an imbalanced large graph learning framework, ImLG, for
prediction of whether logic elements will be packed after placement.
Specifically, we propose dedicated feature extraction and feature aggregation
methods to enhance the node representation learning of circuit graphs. With
imbalanced distribution of packed and unpacked logic elements, we further
propose techniques such as graph oversampling and mini-batch training for this
imbalanced learning task in large circuit graphs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework can improve the F1 score by 42.82% compared to
the most recent Gaussian-based prediction method. Physical design results show
that the proposed method can assist the placer in improving routed wirelength
by 0.93% and SLICE occupation by 0.89%.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-die FPGAs are crucial components in modern computing systems,
particularly for high-performance applications such as artificial intelligence
and data centers. Super long lines (SLLs) provide interconnections between
super logic regions (SLRs) for a multi-die FPGA on a silicon interposer. They
have significantly higher delay compared to regular interconnects, which need
to be minimized. With the increase in design complexity, the growth of SLLs
gives rise to challenges in timing and power closure. Existing placement
algorithms focus on optimizing the number of SLLs but often face limitations
due to specific topologies of SLRs. Furthermore, they fall short of achieving
continuous optimization of SLLs throughout the entire placement process. This
highlights the necessity for more advanced and adaptable solutions.
<br />In this paper, we propose LEAPS, a comprehensive, systematic, and adaptable
multi-die FPGA placement algorithm for SLL minimization. Our contributions are
threefold: 1) proposing a high-performance global placement algorithm for
multi-die FPGAs that optimizes the number of SLLs while addressing other
essential design constraints such as wirelength, routability, and clock
routing; 2) introducing a versatile method for more complex SLR topologies of
multi-die FPGAs, surpassing the limitations of existing approaches; and 3)
executing continuous optimization of SLLs across the whole placement stages,
including global placement (GP), legalization (LG), and detailed placement
(DP). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LEAPS in reducing
SLLs and enhancing circuit performance. Compared with the most recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, LEAPS achieves an average reduction of 40.19%
in SLLs and 9.99% in HPWL, while exhibiting a notable 34.34$\times$ improvement
in runtime.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are ubiquitous in almost all levels of
education since they are easy to administer, grade, and are a reliable format
in both assessments and practices. An important aspect of MCQs is the
distractors, i.e., incorrect options that are designed to target specific
misconceptions or insufficient knowledge among students. To date, the task of
crafting high-quality distractors has largely remained a labor-intensive
process for teachers and learning content designers, which has limited
scalability. In this work, we explore the task of automated distractor and
corresponding feedback message generation in math MCQs using large language
models. We establish a formulation of these two tasks and propose a simple,
in-context learning-based solution. Moreover, we explore using two non-standard
metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated distractors and feedback
messages. We conduct extensive experiments on these tasks using a real-world
MCQ dataset that contains student response information. Our findings suggest
that there is a lot of room for improvement in automated distractor and

<p class="mathjax">Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, is a subfield of natural
language processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and extracting subjective
information in textual material. This can include determining the overall
sentiment of a piece of text (e.g., positive or negative), as well as
identifying specific emotions or opinions expressed in the text, that involves
the use of advanced machine and deep learning techniques. Recently,
transformer-based language models make this task of human emotion analysis
intuitive, thanks to the attention mechanism and parallel computation. These
advantages make such models very powerful on linguistic tasks, unlike recurrent
neural networks that spend a lot of time on sequential processing, making them
prone to fail when it comes to processing long text. The scope of our paper
aims to study the behaviour of the cutting-edge Transformer-based language
models on opinion mining and provide a high-level comparison between them to
highlight their key particularities. Additionally, our comparative study shows
leads and paves the way for production engineers regarding the approach to
focus on and is useful for researchers as it provides guidelines for future
research subjects.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated promising results in various
complex tasks. However, current DNNs encounter challenges with
over-parameterization, especially when there is limited training data
available. To enhance the generalization capability of DNNs, the Mixup
technique has gained popularity. Nevertheless, it still produces suboptimal
outcomes. Inspired by the successful Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)
approach, which establishes a connection between the sharpness of the training
loss landscape and model generalization, we propose a new learning framework
called Generalized-Mixup, which combines the strengths of Mixup and SAM for
training DNN models. The theoretical analysis provided demonstrates how the
developed G-Mix framework enhances generalization. Additionally, to further
optimize DNN performance with the G-Mix framework, we introduce two novel
algorithms: Binary G-Mix and Decomposed G-Mix. These algorithms partition the
training data into two subsets based on the sharpness-sensitivity of each
example to address the issue of "manifold intrusion" in Mixup. Both theoretical
explanations and experimental results reveal that the proposed BG-Mix and
DG-Mix algorithms further enhance model generalization across multiple datasets
and models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">Non-stationarity is a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), where agents update their behaviour as they learn. Many
theoretical advances in MARL avoid the challenge of non-stationarity by
coordinating the policy updates of agents in various ways, including
synchronizing times at which agents are allowed to revise their policies.
Synchronization enables analysis of many MARL algorithms via multi-timescale
methods, but such synchrony is infeasible in many decentralized applications.
In this paper, we study an asynchronous variant of the decentralized Q-learning
algorithm, a recent MARL algorithm for stochastic games. We provide sufficient
conditions under which the asynchronous algorithm drives play to equilibrium
with high probability. Our solution utilizes constant learning rates in the
Q-factor update, which we show to be critical for relaxing the synchrony
assumptions of earlier work. Our analysis also applies to asynchronous
generalizations of a number of other algorithms from the regret testing
tradition, whose performance is analyzed by multi-timescale methods that study
Markov chains obtained via policy update dynamics. This work extends the
applicability of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm and its relatives to
settings in which parameters are selected in an independent manner, and tames
non-stationarity without imposing the coordination assumptions of prior work.

<p class="mathjax">Computational notebooks, tools that facilitate storytelling through
exploration, data analysis, and information visualization, have become the
widely accepted standard in the data science community. These notebooks have
been widely adopted through notebook software such as Jupyter, Datalore and
Google Colab, both in academia and industry. While there is extensive research
to learn how data scientists use computational notebooks, identify their pain
points, and enable collaborative data science practices, very little is known
about the various accessibility barriers experienced by blind and visually
impaired (BVI) users using these notebooks. BVI users are unable to use
computational notebook interfaces due to (1) inaccessibility of the interface,
(2) common ways in which data is represented in these interfaces, and (3)
inability for popular libraries to provide accessible outputs. We perform a
large scale systematic analysis of 100000 Jupyter notebooks to identify various
accessibility challenges in published notebooks affecting the creation and
consumption of these notebooks. Through our findings, we make recommendations
to improve accessibility of the artifacts of a notebook, suggest authoring
practices, and propose changes to infrastructure to make notebooks accessible.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial robustness poses a critical challenge in the deployment of deep
learning models for real-world applications. Traditional approaches to
adversarial training and supervised detection rely on prior knowledge of attack
types and access to labeled training data, which is often impractical. Existing
unsupervised adversarial detection methods identify whether the target model
works properly, but they suffer from bad accuracies owing to the use of common
cross-entropy training loss, which relies on unnecessary features and
strengthens adversarial attacks. We propose new training losses to reduce
useless features and the corresponding detection method without prior knowledge
of adversarial attacks. The detection rate (true positive rate) against all
given white-box attacks is above 93.9% except for attacks without limits
(DF($\infty$)), while the false positive rate is barely 2.5%. The proposed
method works well in all tested attack types and the false positive rates are
even better than the methods good at certain types.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to navigate to the target location
by following a given instruction. Unlike existing methods focused on predicting
a more accurate action at each step in navigation, in this paper, we make the
first attempt to tackle a long-ignored problem in VLN: narrowing the gap
between Success Rate (SR) and Oracle Success Rate (OSR). We observe a
consistently large gap (up to 9%) on four state-of-the-art VLN methods across
two benchmark datasets: R2R and REVERIE. The high OSR indicates the robot agent
passes the target location, while the low SR suggests the agent actually fails
to stop at the target location at last. Instead of predicting actions directly,
we propose to mine the target location from a trajectory given by off-the-shelf
VLN models. Specially, we design a multi-module transformer-based model for
learning compact discriminative trajectory viewpoint representation, which is
used to predict the confidence of being a target location as described in the
instruction. The proposed method is evaluated on three widely-adopted datasets:
R2R, REVERIE and NDH, and shows promising results, demonstrating the potential
for more future research.

<p class="mathjax">With the continuous increase in the size and complexity of machine learning
models, the need for specialized hardware to efficiently run such models is
rapidly growing. To address such a need, silicon-photonic-based neural network
(SP-NN) accelerators have recently emerged as a promising alternative to
electronic accelerators due to their lower latency and higher energy
efficiency. Not only can SP-NNs alleviate the fan-in and fan-out problem with
linear algebra processors, their operational bandwidth can match that of the
photodetection rate (typically 100 GHz), which is at least over an order of
magnitude faster than electronic counterparts that are restricted to a clock
rate of a few GHz. Unfortunately, the underlying silicon photonic devices in
SP-NNs suffer from inherent optical losses and crosstalk noise originating from
fabrication imperfections and undesired optical couplings, the impact of which
accumulates as the network scales up. Consequently, the inferencing accuracy in
an SP-NN can be affected by such inefficiencies -- e.g., can drop to below 10%
-- the impact of which is yet to be fully studied. In this paper, we
comprehensively model the optical loss and crosstalk noise using a bottom-up
approach, from the device to the system level, in coherent SP-NNs built using
Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) devices. The proposed models can be applied
to any SP-NN architecture with different configurations to analyze the effect
of loss and crosstalk. Such an analysis is important where there are
inferencing accuracy and scalability requirements to meet when designing an
SP-NN. Using the proposed analytical framework, we show a high power penalty
and a catastrophic inferencing accuracy drop of up to 84% for SP-NNs of
different scales with three known MZI mesh configurations (i.e., Reck,
Clements, and Diamond) due to accumulated optical loss and crosstalk noise.

<p class="mathjax">Infrared and visible image fusion has gradually proved to be a vital fork in
the field of multi-modality imaging technologies. In recent developments,
researchers not only focus on the quality of fused images but also evaluate
their performance in downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the majority of methods
seldom put their eyes on the mutual learning from different modalities,
resulting in fused images lacking significant details and textures. To overcome
this issue, we propose an interactive graph neural network (GNN)-based
architecture between cross modality for fusion, called IGNet. Specifically, we
first apply a multi-scale extractor to achieve shallow features, which are
employed as the necessary input to build graph structures. Then, the graph
interaction module can construct the extracted intermediate features of the
infrared/visible branch into graph structures. Meanwhile, the graph structures
of two branches interact for cross-modality and semantic learning, so that
fused images can maintain the important feature expressions and enhance the
performance of downstream tasks. Besides, the proposed leader nodes can improve
information propagation in the same modality. Finally, we merge all graph
features to get the fusion result. Extensive experiments on different datasets
(TNO, MFNet and M3FD) demonstrate that our IGNet can generate visually
appealing fused images while scoring averagely 2.59% mAP@.5 and 7.77% mIoU
higher in detection and segmentation than the compared state-of-the-art
methods. The source code of the proposed IGNet can be available at
https://github.com/lok-18/IGNet.

<p class="mathjax">Aerial dogfights necessitate understanding the tactically changing maneuvers
from a long-term perspective, along with the rapidly changing aerodynamics from
a short-term view. In this paper, we propose a novel long short-term temporal
fusion transformer (TempFuser) for a policy network in aerial dogfights. Our
method uses two LSTM-based input embeddings to encode long-term, sparse state
trajectories, as well as short-term, dense state trajectories. By integrating
the two embeddings through a transformer encoder, the method subsequently
derives end-to-end flight commands for agile and tactical maneuvers. We
formulate a deep reinforcement learning framework to train our TempFuser-based
policy model. We then extensively validate our model, demonstrating that it
outperforms other baseline models against a diverse range of opponent aircraft
in a high-fidelity environment. Our model successfully learns basic fighter
maneuvers, human pilot-like tactical maneuvers, and robust supersonic pursuit
in low altitudes without explicitly coded prior knowledge. Videos are available

<p class="mathjax">The efficacy of availability poisoning, a method of poisoning data by
injecting imperceptible perturbations to prevent its use in model training, has
been a hot subject of investigation. Previous research suggested that it was
difficult to effectively counteract such poisoning attacks. However, the
introduction of various defense methods has challenged this notion. Due to the
rapid progress in this field, the performance of different novel methods cannot
be accurately validated due to variations in experimental setups. To further
evaluate the attack and defense capabilities of these poisoning methods, we
have developed a benchmark -- APBench for assessing the efficacy of adversarial
poisoning. APBench consists of 9 state-of-the-art availability poisoning
attacks, 8 defense algorithms, and 4 conventional data augmentation techniques.
We also have set up experiments with varying different poisoning ratios, and
evaluated the attacks on multiple datasets and their transferability across
model architectures. We further conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 2
additional attacks specifically targeting unsupervised models. Our results
reveal the glaring inadequacy of existing attacks in safeguarding individual
privacy. APBench is open source and available to the deep learning community:

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, battery technology for electric vehicles (EVs) has been a
major focus, with a significant emphasis on developing new battery materials
and chemistries. However, accurately predicting key battery parameters, such as
state-of-charge (SOC) and temperature, remains a challenge for constructing
advanced battery management systems (BMS). Existing battery models do not
comprehensively cover all parameters affecting battery performance, including
non-battery-related factors like ambient temperature, cabin temperature,
elevation, and regenerative braking during EV operation. Due to the difficulty
of incorporating these auxiliary parameters into traditional models, a
data-driven approach is suggested. Time-series-transformers (TSTs), leveraging
multiheaded attention and parallelization-friendly architecture, are explored
alongside LSTM models. Novel TST architectures, including encoder TST + decoder
LSTM and a hybrid TST-LSTM, are also developed and compared against existing
models. A dataset comprising 72 driving trips in a BMW i3 (60 Ah) is used to
address battery life prediction in EVs, aiming to create accurate TST models
that incorporate environmental, battery, vehicle driving, and heating circuit
data to predict SOC and battery temperature for future time steps.

<p class="mathjax">Scene Text Image Super-resolution (STISR) aims to recover high-resolution
(HR) scene text images with visually pleasant and readable text content from
the given low-resolution (LR) input. Most existing works focus on recovering
English texts, which have relatively simple character structures, while little
work has been done on the more challenging Chinese texts with diverse and
complex character structures. In this paper, we propose a real-world
Chinese-English benchmark dataset, namely Real-CE, for the task of STISR with
the emphasis on restoring structurally complex Chinese characters. The
benchmark provides 1,935/783 real-world LR-HR text image pairs~(contains 33,789
text lines in total) for training/testing in 2$\times$ and 4$\times$ zooming
modes, complemented by detailed annotations, including detection boxes and text
transcripts. Moreover, we design an edge-aware learning method, which provides
structural supervision in image and feature domains, to effectively reconstruct
the dense structures of Chinese characters. We conduct experiments on the
proposed Real-CE benchmark and evaluate the existing STISR models with and
without our edge-aware loss. The benchmark, including data and source code, is
available at https://github.com/mjq11302010044/Real-CE.

<p class="mathjax">Motion planning has been an important research topic in achieving safe and
flexible maneuvers for intelligent vehicles. However, it remains challenging to
realize efficient and optimal planning in the presence of uncertain model
dynamics. In this paper, a sparse kernel-based reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm with Gaussian Process (GP) Regression (called GP-SKRL) is proposed to
achieve online adaption and near-optimal motion planning performance. In this
algorithm, we design an efficient sparse GP regression method to learn the
uncertain dynamics. Based on the updated model, a sparse kernel-based policy
iteration algorithm with an exponential barrier function is designed to learn
the near-optimal planning policies with the capability to avoid dynamic
obstacles. Thereby, batch-mode GP-SKRL with online adaption capability can
estimate the changing system dynamics. The converged RL policies are then
deployed on vehicles efficiently under a safety-aware module. As a result, the
produced driving actions are safe and less conservative, and the planning
performance has been noticeably improved. Extensive simulation results show
that GP-SKRL outperforms several advanced motion planning methods in terms of
average cumulative cost, trajectory length, and task completion time. In
particular, experiments on a Hongqi E-HS3 vehicle demonstrate that superior
GP-SKRL provides a practical planning solution.

<p class="mathjax">Hotword customization is one of the important issues remained in ASR field -
it is of value to enable users of ASR systems to customize names of entities,
persons and other phrases. The past few years have seen both implicit and
explicit modeling strategies for ASR contextualization developed. While these
approaches have performed adequately, they still exhibit certain shortcomings,
such as instability in effectiveness, especially in non-autoregressive ASR
models. In this paper we propose Semantic-augmented Contextual-Paraformer
(SeACo-Paraformer) a novel NAR based ASR system with flexible and effective
hotword customization ability. It combines the accuracy of the AED-based model,
the efficiency of the NAR model, and the excellent performance in
contextualization. In tens of thousands of hours industrial big data
experiments, our proposed model outperforms strong baselines in customization
and general ASR tasks. Besides, we explore an efficient way to filter large
scale incoming hotwords for further improvement.

<p class="mathjax">This paper identifies two kinds of redundancy in the current VideoQA
paradigm. Specifically, the current video encoders tend to holistically embed
all video clues at different granularities in a hierarchical manner, which
inevitably introduces \textit{neighboring-frame redundancy} that can overwhelm
detailed visual clues at the object level. Subsequently, prevailing
vision-language fusion designs introduce the \textit{cross-modal redundancy} by
exhaustively fusing all visual elements with question tokens without explicitly
differentiating their pairwise vision-language interactions, thus making a
pernicious impact on the answering.
<br />To this end, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture, that aims to
model VideoQA in a redundancy-aware manner. To address the neighboring-frame
redundancy, we introduce a video encoder structure that emphasizes the
object-level change in neighboring frames, while adopting an out-of-neighboring
message-passing scheme that imposes attention only on distant frames. As for
the cross-modal redundancy, we equip our fusion module with a novel adaptive
sampling, which explicitly differentiates the vision-language interactions by
identifying a small subset of visual elements that exclusively support the
answer. Upon these advancements, we find this
\underline{R}edundancy-\underline{a}ware trans\underline{former} (RaFormer) can
achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple VideoQA benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a comprehensive framework for advancing research and
policy development related to decarbonization in electric power systems. It
encompasses three pivotal subjects, including carbon accounting, carbon-aware
decision-making, and carbon-electricity market design. For each of these
subjects, this paper outlines the key problems, existing methods, and potential
solutions. Distinguished from existing pool-based emissions models, this
framework introduces a novel flow-based emissions model that incorporates the
underlying physical power grid and power flows. It thus enables precise carbon
accounting at both temporal and spatial scales, facilitating informed
decision-making towards achieving the ultimate objective of grid
decarbonization. Specifically, this framework presents a flow-based accounting
methodology, introduces the carbon-aware optimal power flow (C-OPF) technique
as the theoretical foundation for decarbonization decision-making, and explores
the potential design of carbon-electricity markets and carbon pricing
mechanisms to incentivize decentralized decarbonization actions. Additionally,
this paper provides in-depth discussions of the critical issues that arise
within these subjects, such as data availability, infrastructure development,
fairness and equity, and more.

<p class="mathjax">Recent works in neural knowledge graph inference attempt to combine logic
rules with knowledge graph embeddings to benefit from prior knowledge. However,
they usually cannot avoid rule grounding, and injecting a diverse set of rules
has still not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we propose InjEx, a
mechanism to inject multiple types of rules through simple constraints, which
capture definite Horn rules. To start, we theoretically prove that InjEx can
inject such rules. Next, to demonstrate that InjEx infuses interpretable prior
knowledge into the embedding space, we evaluate InjEx on both the knowledge
graph completion (KGC) and few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) settings.
Our experimental results reveal that InjEx outperforms both baseline KGC models
as well as specialized few-shot models while maintaining its scalability and
efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional Graph Neural Network (GNN), as a graph representation learning
method, is constrained by label information. However, Graph Contrastive
Learning (GCL) methods, which tackle the label problem effectively, mainly
focus on the feature information of the global graph or small subgraph
structure (e.g., the first-order neighborhood). In the paper, we propose a
Local Structure-aware Graph Contrastive representation Learning method (LS-GCL)
to model the structural information of nodes from multiple views. Specifically,
we construct the semantic subgraphs that are not limited to the first-order
neighbors. For the local view, the semantic subgraph of each target node is
input into a shared GNN encoder to obtain the target node embeddings at the
subgraph-level. Then, we use a pooling function to generate the subgraph-level
graph embeddings. For the global view, considering the original graph preserves
indispensable semantic information of nodes, we leverage the shared GNN encoder
to learn the target node embeddings at the global graph-level. The proposed
LS-GCL model is optimized to maximize the common information among similar
instances at three various perspectives through a multi-level contrastive loss
function. Experimental results on five datasets illustrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art graph representation learning approaches for both
node classification and link prediction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Most previous approaches for analyzing food images have relied on extensively
annotated datasets, resulting in significant human labeling expenses due to the
varied and intricate nature of such images. Inspired by the effectiveness of
contrastive self-supervised methods in utilizing unlabelled data, weiqing
explore leveraging these techniques on unlabelled food images. In contrastive
self-supervised methods, two views are randomly generated from an image by data
augmentations. However, regarding food images, the two views tend to contain
similar informative contents, causing large mutual information, which impedes
the efficacy of contrastive self-supervised learning. To address this problem,
we propose Feature Suppressed Contrast (FeaSC) to reduce mutual information
between views. As the similar contents of the two views are salient or highly
responsive in the feature map, the proposed FeaSC uses a response-aware scheme
to localize salient features in an unsupervised manner. By suppressing some
salient features in one view while leaving another contrast view unchanged, the
mutual information between the two views is reduced, thereby enhancing the
effectiveness of contrast learning for self-supervised food pre-training. As a
plug-and-play module, the proposed method consistently improves BYOL and
SimSiam by 1.70\% $\sim$ 6.69\% classification accuracy on four publicly
available food recognition datasets. Superior results have also been achieved
on downstream segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate time series long-term prediction, which aims to predict the
change of data in a long time, can provide references for decision-making.
Although transformer-based models have made progress in this field, they
usually do not make full use of three features of multivariate time series:
global information, local information, and variables correlation. To
effectively mine the above three features and establish a high-precision
prediction model, we propose a double sampling transformer (DSformer), which
consists of the double sampling (DS) block and the temporal variable attention
(TVA) block. Firstly, the DS block employs down sampling and piecewise sampling
to transform the original series into feature vectors that focus on global
information and local information respectively. Then, TVA block uses temporal
attention and variable attention to mine these feature vectors from different
dimensions and extract key information. Finally, based on a parallel structure,
DSformer uses multiple TVA blocks to mine and integrate different features
obtained from DS blocks respectively. The integrated feature information is
passed to the generative decoder based on a multi-layer perceptron to realize
multivariate time series long-term prediction. Experimental results on nine
real-world datasets show that DSformer can outperform eight existing baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Meeting summarization has emerged as a promising technique for providing
users with condensed summaries. However, existing work has focused on training
models on centralized data, neglecting real-world scenarios where meeting data
are infeasible to collect centrally, due to their sensitive nature. This gap
motivates us to explore federated learning for meeting summarization. Two
critical challenges impede progress. First, state-of-the-art summarizers are
based on parameter-heavy pre-trained models. Exchanging such a model's
parameters across clients imposes large bandwidth costs. Second, as real-world
meeting data belong to various domains and are distributed across clients, they
are instances of non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID). IID
assumptions do not hold, which changes which forms of learning algorithms best
apply. To address this, we propose Adapter-based Federated Selective Knowledge
Distillation (AdaFedSelecKD) for training performant client models.
Specifically, we develop an adapter-based summarization model where two
adapters cooperatively facilitate learning using fewer parameters to reduce
communication costs. Then, we devise a selective knowledge distillation
strategy, assisting clients in robustly handling domain-focused modelling on
their own data, while leveraging global parameters based on non-IID data.
Extensive experiments on the QMSum benchmark demonstrate AdaFedSelecKD can
achieve comparable performance with powerful centralized training methods, and
shows its generalizability and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Videos that are shot using commodity hardware such as phones and surveillance
cameras record various metadata such as time and location. We encounter such
geospatial videos on a daily basis and such videos have been growing in volume
significantly. Yet, we do not have data management systems that allow users to
interact with such data effectively.
<br />In this paper, we describe Spatialyze, a new framework for end-to-end
querying of geospatial videos. Spatialyze comes with a domain-specific language
where users can construct geospatial video analytic workflows using a 3-step,
declarative, build-filter-observe paradigm. Internally, Spatialyze leverages
the declarative nature of such workflows, the temporal-spatial metadata stored
with videos, and physical behavior of real-world objects to optimize the
execution of workflows. Our results using real-world videos and workflows show
that Spatialyze can reduce execution time by up to 5.3x, while maintaining up
to 97.1% accuracy compared to unoptimized execution.

<p class="mathjax">Formal method-based analysis of the 5G Wireless Communication Protocol is
crucial for identifying logical vulnerabilities and facilitating an
all-encompassing security assessment, especially in the design phase. Natural
Language Processing (NLP) assisted techniques and most of the tools are not
widely adopted by the industry and research community. Traditional formal
verification through a mathematics approach heavily relied on manual logical
abstraction prone to being time-consuming, and error-prone. The reason that the
NLP-assisted method did not apply in industrial research may be due to the
ambiguity in the natural language of the protocol designs nature is
controversial to the explicitness of formal verification. To address the
challenge of adopting the formal methods in protocol designs, targeting (3GPP)
protocols that are written in natural language, in this study, we propose a
hybrid approach to streamline the analysis of protocols. We introduce a
two-step pipeline that first uses NLP tools to construct data and then uses
constructed data to extract identifiers and formal properties by using the NLP
model. The identifiers and formal properties are further used for formal
analysis. We implemented three models that take different dependencies between
identifiers and formal properties as criteria. Our results of the optimal model
reach valid accuracy of 39% for identifier extraction and 42% for formal
properties predictions. Our work is proof of concept for an efficient procedure
in performing formal analysis for largescale complicate specification and
protocol analysis, especially for 5G and nextG communications.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalizability,
such as understanding arbitrary entities and relations. Instruction tuning has
proven effective for distilling LLMs into more cost-efficient models such as
Alpaca and Vicuna. Yet such student models still trail the original LLMs by
large margins in downstream applications. In this paper, we explore targeted
distillation with mission-focused instruction tuning to train student models
that can excel in a broad application class such as open information
extraction. Using named entity recognition (NER) for case study, we show how
ChatGPT can be distilled into much smaller UniversalNER models for open NER.
For evaluation, we assemble the largest NER benchmark to date, comprising 43
datasets across 9 diverse domains such as biomedicine, programming, social
media, law, finance. Without using any direct supervision, UniversalNER attains
remarkable NER accuracy across tens of thousands of entity types, outperforming
general instruction-tuned models such as Alpaca and Vicuna by over 30 absolute
F1 points in average. With a tiny fraction of parameters, UniversalNER not only
acquires ChatGPT's capability in recognizing arbitrary entity types, but also
outperforms its NER accuracy by 7-9 absolute F1 points in average. Remarkably,
UniversalNER even outperforms by a large margin state-of-the-art multi-task
instruction-tuned systems such as InstructUIE, which uses supervised NER
examples. We also conduct thorough ablation studies to assess the impact of
various components in our distillation approach. We will release the
distillation recipe, data, and UniversalNER models to facilitate future
research on targeted distillation.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has exhibited significant success in
novel view synthesis, surface reconstruction, etc. However, since no physical
reflection is considered in its rendering pipeline, NeRF mistakes the
reflection in the mirror as a separate virtual scene, leading to the inaccurate
reconstruction of the mirror and multi-view inconsistent reflections in the
mirror. In this paper, we present a novel neural rendering framework, named
Mirror-NeRF, which is able to learn accurate geometry and reflection of the
mirror and support various scene manipulation applications with mirrors, such
as adding new objects or mirrors into the scene and synthesizing the
reflections of these new objects in mirrors, controlling mirror roughness, etc.
To achieve this goal, we propose a unified radiance field by introducing the
reflection probability and tracing rays following the light transport model of
Whitted Ray Tracing, and also develop several techniques to facilitate the
learning process. Experiments and comparisons on both synthetic and real
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and supplementary
material are available on the project webpage:

<p class="mathjax">We present GTE, a general-purpose text embedding model trained with
multi-stage contrastive learning. In line with recent advancements in unifying
various NLP tasks into a single format, we train a unified text embedding model
by employing contrastive learning over a diverse mixture of datasets from
multiple sources. By significantly increasing the number of training data
during both unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning stages, we
achieve substantial performance gains over existing embedding models. Notably,
even with a relatively modest parameter count of 110M, GTE$_\text{base}$
outperforms the black-box embedding API provided by OpenAI and even surpasses
10x larger text embedding models on the massive text embedding benchmark.
Furthermore, without additional fine-tuning on each programming language
individually, our model outperforms previous best code retrievers of similar
size by treating code as text. In summary, our model achieves impressive
results by effectively harnessing multi-stage contrastive learning, offering a
powerful and efficient text embedding model with broad applicability across
various NLP and code-related tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The scene graph generation (SGG) task is designed to identify the predicates
based on the subject-object pairs.However,existing datasets generally include
two imbalance cases: one is the class imbalance from the predicted predicates
and another is the context imbalance from the given subject-object pairs, which
presents significant challenges for SGG. Most existing methods focus on the
imbalance of the predicted predicate while ignoring the imbalance of the
subject-object pairs, which could not achieve satisfactory results. To address
the two imbalance cases, we propose a novel Environment Invariant Curriculum
Relation learning (EICR) method, which can be applied in a plug-and-play
fashion to existing SGG methods. Concretely, to remove the imbalance of the
subject-object pairs, we first construct different distribution environments
for the subject-object pairs and learn a model invariant to the environment
changes. Then, we construct a class-balanced curriculum learning strategy to
balance the different environments to remove the predicate imbalance.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that our
EICR framework can be taken as a general strategy for various SGG models, and
achieve significant improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods targeting scene images have seen a
rapid growth recently, and they mostly rely on either a dedicated dense
matching mechanism or a costly unsupervised object discovery module. This paper
shows that instead of hinging on these strenuous operations, quality image
representations can be learned by treating scene/multi-label image SSL simply
as a multi-label classification problem, which greatly simplifies the learning
framework. Specifically, multiple binary pseudo-labels are assigned for each
input image by comparing its embeddings with those in two dictionaries, and the
network is optimized using the binary cross entropy loss. The proposed method
is named Multi-Label Self-supervised learning (MLS). Visualizations
qualitatively show that clearly the pseudo-labels by MLS can automatically find
semantically similar pseudo-positive pairs across different images to
facilitate contrastive learning. MLS learns high quality representations on
MS-COCO and achieves state-of-the-art results on classification, detection and
segmentation benchmarks. At the same time, MLS is much simpler than existing
methods, making it easier to deploy and for further exploration.

<p class="mathjax">The solutions of scalar ordinary differential equations become more complex
as their coefficients increase in magnitude. As a consequence, when a standard
solver is applied to such an equation, its running time grows with the
magnitudes of the equation's coefficients. It is well known, however, that
scalar ordinary differential equations with slowly-varying coefficients admit
slowly-varying phase functions whose cost to represent via standard techniques
is largely independent of the magnitude of the equation's coefficients. This
observation is the basis of most methods for the asymptotic approximation of
the solutions of ordinary differential equations, including the WKB method.
Here, we introduce two numerical algorithms for constructing phase functions
for scalar ordinary differential equations inspired by the classical Levin
method for the calculation of oscillatory integrals. In the case of a large
class of scalar ordinary differential equations with slowly-varying
coefficients, their running times are independent of the magnitude of the
equation's coefficients. The results of extensive numerical experiments
demonstrating the properties of our algorithms are presented.

is possible to distinguish graphs on $n$ vertices that have a $\rho n$-clique
from graphs for which at least $\epsilon n^2$ edges must be added to form a
$\rho n$-clique by sampling and inspecting a random subgraph on only
$\tilde{O}(\rho^3/\epsilon^2)$ vertices.
<br />We also establish new sample complexity bounds for $\epsilon$-testing
$k$-colorability. In this case, we show that a sampled subgraph on
$\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$ vertices suffices to distinguish $k$-colorable graphs
from those for which any $k$-coloring of the vertices causes at least $\epsilon
n^2$ edges to be monochromatic.
<br />The new bounds for testing the $\rho$-clique and $k$-colorability properties
are both obtained via new extensions of the graph container method. This method
has been an effective tool for tackling various problems in graph theory and
combinatorics. Our results demonstrate that it is also a powerful tool for the

<p class="mathjax">Quantization has become a mainstream compression technique for reducing model
size, computational requirements, and energy consumption for modern deep neural
networks (DNNs). With the improved numerical support in recent hardware,
including multiple variants of integer and floating point, mixed-precision
quantization has become necessary to achieve high-quality results with low
model cost. Prior mixed-precision quantization methods have performed a
post-training quantization search, which compromises on accuracy, or a
differentiable quantization search, which leads to high memory usage from
branching. Therefore, we propose the first one-shot mixed-precision
quantization search that eliminates the need for retraining in both integer and
low-precision floating point models. We evaluate our floating-point and integer
quantization search (FLIQS) on multiple convolutional networks and vision
transformer models to discover Pareto-optimal models. Our approach discovers
models that improve upon uniform precision, manual mixed-precision, and recent
integer quantization search methods. With the proposed integer quantization
search, we increase the accuracy of ResNet-18 on ImageNet by 1.31% points and
ResNet-50 by 0.90% points with equivalent model cost over previous methods.
Additionally, for the first time, we explore a novel mixed-precision
floating-point search and improve MobileNetV2 by up to 0.98% points compared to
prior state-of-the-art FP8 models. Finally, we extend FLIQS to simultaneously
search a joint quantization and neural architecture space and improve the
ImageNet accuracy by 2.69% points with similar model cost on a MobileNetV2
search space.

<p class="mathjax">The development of deep learning software libraries enabled significant
progress in the field by allowing users to focus on modeling, while letting the
library to take care of the tedious and time-consuming task of optimizing
execution for modern hardware accelerators. However, this has benefited only
particular types of deep learning models, such as Transformers, whose
primitives map easily to the vectorized computation. The models that explicitly
account for structured objects, such as trees and segmentations, did not
benefit equally because they require custom algorithms that are difficult to
implement in a vectorized form.
<br />SynJax directly addresses this problem by providing an efficient vectorized
implementation of inference algorithms for structured distributions covering
alignment, tagging, segmentation, constituency trees and spanning trees. With
SynJax we can build large-scale differentiable models that explicitly model
structure in the data. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">When individuals engage in spoken discourse, various phenomena can be
observed that differ from those that are apparent in text-based conversation.
While written communication commonly uses a question mark to denote a query, in
spoken discourse, queries are frequently indicated by a rising intonation at
the end of a sentence. However, numerous speech recognition engines do not
append a question mark to recognized queries, presenting a challenge when
creating a spoken dialogue system. Specifically, the absence of a question mark
at the end of a sentence can impede the generation of appropriate responses to
queries in spoken dialogue systems. Hence, we investigate the impact of
question marks on dialogue systems, with the results showing that they have a
significant impact. Moreover, we analyze specific examples in an effort to
determine which types of utterances have the impact on dialogue systems.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid evolution of the Internet of Things, many real-world
applications utilize heterogeneously connected sensors to capture time-series
information. Edge-based machine learning (ML) methodologies are often employed
to analyze locally collected data. However, a fundamental issue across
data-driven ML approaches is distribution shift. It occurs when a model is
deployed on a data distribution different from what it was trained on, and can
substantially degrade model performance. Additionally, increasingly
sophisticated deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed to capture spatial
and temporal dependencies in multi-sensor time series data, requiring intensive
computational resources beyond the capacity of today's edge devices. While
brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has been introduced as a
lightweight solution for edge-based learning, existing HDCs are also vulnerable
to the distribution shift challenge. In this paper, we propose DOMINO, a novel
HDC learning framework addressing the distribution shift problem in noisy
multi-sensor time-series data. DOMINO leverages efficient and parallel matrix
operations on high-dimensional space to dynamically identify and filter out
domain-variant dimensions. Our evaluation on a wide range of multi-sensor time
series classification tasks shows that DOMINO achieves on average 2.04% higher
accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNN-based domain generalization
techniques, and delivers 7.83x faster training and 26.94x faster inference.
More importantly, DOMINO performs notably better when learning from partially
labeled and highly imbalanced data, providing 10.93x higher robustness against
hardware noises than SOTA DNNs.

<p class="mathjax">When trying to gain better visibility into a machine learning model in order
to understand and mitigate the associated risks, a potentially valuable source
of evidence is: which training examples most contribute to a given behavior?
Influence functions aim to answer a counterfactual: how would the model's
parameters (and hence its outputs) change if a given sequence were added to the
training set? While influence functions have produced insights for small
models, they are difficult to scale to large language models (LLMs) due to the
difficulty of computing an inverse-Hessian-vector product (IHVP). We use the
Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC)
approximation to scale influence functions up to LLMs with up to 52 billion
parameters. In our experiments, EK-FAC achieves similar accuracy to traditional
influence function estimators despite the IHVP computation being orders of
magnitude faster. We investigate two algorithmic techniques to reduce the cost
of computing gradients of candidate training sequences: TF-IDF filtering and
query batching. We use influence functions to investigate the generalization
patterns of LLMs, including the sparsity of the influence patterns, increasing
abstraction with scale, math and programming abilities, cross-lingual
generalization, and role-playing behavior. Despite many apparently
sophisticated forms of generalization, we identify a surprising limitation:
influences decay to near-zero when the order of key phrases is flipped.
Overall, influence functions give us a powerful new tool for studying the
generalization properties of LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning technology has become ubiquitous, but, unfortunately, often
exhibits bias. As a consequence, disparate stakeholders need to interact with
and make informed decisions about using machine learning models in everyday
systems. Visualization technology can support stakeholders in understanding and
evaluating trade-offs between, for example, accuracy and fairness of models.
This paper aims to empirically answer "Can visualization design choices affect
a stakeholder's perception of model bias, trust in a model, and willingness to
adopt a model?" Through a series of controlled, crowd-sourced experiments with
more than 1,500 participants, we identify a set of strategies people follow in
deciding which models to trust. Our results show that men and women prioritize
fairness and performance differently and that visual design choices
significantly affect that prioritization. For example, women trust fairer
models more often than men do, participants value fairness more when it is
explained using text than as a bar chart, and being explicitly told a model is
biased has a bigger impact than showing past biased performance. We test the
generalizability of our results by comparing the effect of multiple textual and
visual design choices and offer potential explanations of the cognitive
mechanisms behind the difference in fairness perception and trust. Our research
guides design considerations to support future work developing visualization
systems for machine learning.

<p class="mathjax">Current fake audio detection algorithms have achieved promising performances
on most datasets. However, their performance may be significantly degraded when
dealing with audio of a different dataset. The orthogonal weight modification
to overcome catastrophic forgetting does not consider the similarity of genuine
audio across different datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
continual learning algorithm for fake audio detection to overcome catastrophic
forgetting, called Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM). When
fine-tuning a detection network, our approach adaptively computes the direction
of weight modification according to the ratio of genuine utterances and fake
utterances. The adaptive modification direction ensures the network can
effectively detect fake audio on the new dataset while preserving its knowledge
of old model, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In addition, genuine
audio collected from quite different acoustic conditions may skew their feature
distribution, so we introduce a regularization constraint to force the network
to remember the old distribution in this regard. Our method can easily be
generalized to related fields, like speech emotion recognition. We also
evaluate our approach across multiple datasets and obtain a significant
performance improvement on cross-dataset experiments.

<p class="mathjax">The low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method can largely reduce the amount of
trainable parameters for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), however, it
still requires expensive activation memory to update low-rank weights. Reducing
the number of LoRA layers or using activation recomputation could harm the
fine-tuning performance or increase the computational overhead. In this work,
we present LoRA-FA, a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that reduces the
activation memory without performance degradation and expensive recomputation.
LoRA-FA chooses to freeze the projection-down weight of $A$ and update the
projection-up weight of $B$ in each LoRA layer. It ensures the change of model
weight reside in a low-rank space during LLMs fine-tuning, while eliminating
the requirement to store full-rank input activations. We conduct extensive
experiments across multiple model types (RoBERTa, T5, LLaMA) and model scales.
Our results show that LoRA-FA can always achieve close fine-tuning accuracy
across different tasks compared to full parameter fine-tuning and LoRA.
Furthermore, LoRA-FA can reduce the overall memory cost by up to 1.4$\times$
compared to LoRA.

<p class="mathjax">Implicit graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a potential approach to
enable GNNs to capture long-range dependencies effectively. However, poorly
designed implicit GNN layers can experience over-smoothing or may have limited
adaptability to learn data geometry, potentially hindering their performance in
graph learning problems. To address these issues, we introduce a geometric
framework to design implicit graph diffusion layers based on a parameterized
graph Laplacian operator. Our framework allows learning the geometry of vertex
and edge spaces, as well as the graph gradient operator from data. We further
show how implicit GNN layers can be viewed as the fixed-point solution of a
Dirichlet energy minimization problem and give conditions under which it may
suffer from over-smoothing. To overcome the over-smoothing problem, we design
our implicit graph diffusion layer as the solution of a Dirichlet energy
minimization problem with constraints on vertex features, enabling it to trade
off smoothing with the preservation of node feature information. With an
appropriate hyperparameter set to be larger than the largest eigenvalue of the
parameterized graph Laplacian, our framework guarantees a unique equilibrium
and quick convergence. Our models demonstrate better performance than leading
implicit and explicit GNNs on benchmark datasets for node and graph
classification tasks, with substantial accuracy improvements observed for some
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the model-checking problem of Synchronized Computation-Tree Logic
(CTL+Sync) over One-Counter Automata (OCAs). CTL+Sync augments CTL with
temporal operators that require several paths to satisfy properties in a
synchronous manner, e.g., the property ``all paths should eventually see $p$ at
the same time''. The model-checking problem for CTL+Sync over finite-state
Kripke structures was shown to be in $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{NP}^{\mathsf{NP}}}$.
OCAs are labelled transition systems equipped with a non-negative counter that
can be zero-tested. Thus, they induce infinite-state systems whose computation
trees are not regular. The model-checking problem for CTL over OCAs was shown
to be $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete.
<br />We show that the model-checking problem for CTL+Sync over OCAs is decidable.
However, the upper bound we give is non-elementary. We therefore proceed to
study the problem for a central fragment of CTL+Sync, extending CTL with
operators that require all paths to satisfy properties in a synchronous manner,
and show that it is in $\mathsf{EXP}^\mathsf{NEXP}$ (and in particular in
$\mathsf{EXPSPACE}$), by exhibiting a certain "segmented periodicity" in the
computation trees of OCAs.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the advances and ubiquity of digital communication media such as
videoconferencing and virtual reality, they remain oblivious to the rich
intentions expressed by users. Beyond transmitting audio, videos, and messages,
we envision digital communication media as proactive facilitators that can
provide unobtrusive assistance to enhance communication and collaboration.
Informed by the results of a formative study, we propose three key design
concepts to explore the systematic integration of intelligence into
communication and collaboration, including the panel substrate, language-based
intent recognition, and lightweight interaction techniques. We developed
CrossTalk, a videoconferencing system that instantiates these concepts, which
was found to enable a more fluid and flexible communication and collaboration
experience.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated program
reasoning, a crucial aspect of many security tasks. However, existing LLM
architectures for code are often borrowed from other domains like natural
language processing, raising concerns about their generalization and robustness
to unseen code. A key generalization challenge is to incorporate the knowledge
of code semantics, including control and data flow, into the LLM architectures.
<br />Drawing inspiration from examples of convolution layers exploiting
translation symmetry, we explore how code symmetries can enhance LLM
architectures for program analysis and modeling. We present a rigorous
group-theoretic framework that formally defines code symmetries as
semantics-preserving transformations and provides techniques for precisely
reasoning about symmetry preservation within LLM architectures. Using this
framework, we introduce a novel variant of self-attention that preserves
program symmetries, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalization and
robustness through detailed experimental evaluations across different binary
and source code analysis tasks. Overall, our code symmetry framework offers
rigorous and powerful reasoning techniques that can guide the future
development of specialized LLMs for code and advance LLM-guided program
reasoning tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The process of opinion expression and exchange is a critical component of
democratic societies. As people interact with large language models (LLMs) in
the opinion shaping process different from traditional media, the impacts of
LLMs are increasingly recognized and being concerned. However, the knowledge
about how LLMs affect the process of opinion expression and exchange of social
opinion networks is very limited. Here, we create an opinion network dynamics
model to encode the opinions of LLMs, cognitive acceptability and usage
strategies of individuals, and simulate the impact of LLMs on opinion dynamics
in a variety of scenarios. The outcomes of the simulations inform about
effective demand-oriented opinion network interventions. The results from this
study suggested that the output opinion of LLMs has a unique and positive
effect on the collective opinion difference. The marginal effect of cognitive
acceptability on collective opinion formation is nonlinear and shows a
decreasing trend. When people partially rely on LLMs, the exchange process of
opinion becomes more intense and the diversity of opinion becomes more
favorable. In fact, there is 38.6% more opinion diversity when people all
partially rely on LLMs, compared to prohibiting the use of LLMs entirely. The
optimal diversity of opinion was found when the fractions of people who do not
use, partially rely on, and fully rely on LLMs reached roughly 4:12:1. Our
experiments also find that introducing extra agents with
opposite/neutral/random opinions, we can effectively mitigate the impact of
biased/toxic output from LLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights into
opinion dynamics in the age of LLMs, highlighting the need for customized
interventions tailored to specific scenarios to address the drawbacks of
improper output and use of LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Smart contracts are prone to various vulnerabilities, leading to substantial
financial losses over time. Current analysis tools mainly target
vulnerabilities with fixed control or dataflow patterns, such as re-entrancy
and integer overflow. However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed
that about 80% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the
lack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent
advances in Generative Pretraining Transformer (GPT), it is worth exploring how
GPT could aid in detecting logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In this
paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static analysis
for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying solely on
GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false positives and is
limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a versatile code
understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability type into
scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities with GPT.
To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently recognize
key variables and statements, which are then validated by static confirmation.
Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects and 3K
Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90%) for token
contracts and acceptable precision (57.14%) for large projects like Web3Bugs.
It effectively detects groundtruth logic vulnerabilities with a recall of over
80%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors. GPTScan is fast
and cost-effective, taking an average of 14.39 seconds and 0.01 USD to scan per
thousand lines of Solidity code. Moreover, static confirmation helps GPTScan
reduce two-thirds of false positives.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning has achieved remarkable success over the past couple of
decades, often attributed to a combination of algorithmic innovations and the
availability of high-quality data available at scale. However, a third critical
component is the fine-tuning of hyperparameters, which plays a pivotal role in
achieving optimal model performance. Despite its significance, hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) remains a challenging task for several reasons. Many HPO
techniques rely on naive search methods or assume that the loss function is
smooth and continuous, which may not always be the case. Traditional methods,
like grid search and Bayesian optimization, often struggle to quickly adapt and
efficiently search the loss landscape. Grid search is computationally
expensive, while Bayesian optimization can be slow to prime. Since the search
space for HPO is frequently high-dimensional and non-convex, it is often
challenging to efficiently find a global minimum. Moreover, optimal
hyperparameters can be sensitive to the specific dataset or task, further
complicating the search process. To address these issues, we propose a new
hyperparameter optimization method, HomOpt, using a data-driven approach based
on a generalized additive model (GAM) surrogate combined with homotopy
optimization. This strategy augments established optimization methodologies to
boost the performance and effectiveness of any given method with faster
convergence to the optimum on continuous, discrete, and categorical domain
spaces. We compare the effectiveness of HomOpt applied to multiple optimization
techniques (e.g., Random Search, TPE, Bayes, and SMAC) showing improved
objective performance on many standardized machine learning benchmarks and
challenging open-set recognition tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving collaborative learning
framework, and differential privacy can be applied to further enhance its
privacy protection. Existing FL systems typically adopt Federated Average
(FedAvg) as the training algorithm and implement differential privacy with a
Gaussian mechanism. However, the inherent privacy-utility trade-off in these
systems severely degrades the training performance if a tight privacy budget is
enforced. Besides, the Gaussian mechanism requires model weights to be of
high-precision. To improve communication efficiency and achieve a better
privacy-utility trade-off, we propose a communication-efficient FL training
algorithm with differential privacy guarantee. Specifically, we propose to
adopt binary neural networks (BNNs) and introduce discrete noise in the FL
setting. Binary model parameters are uploaded for higher communication
efficiency and discrete noise is added to achieve the client-level differential
privacy protection. The achieved performance guarantee is rigorously proved,
and it is shown to depend on the level of discrete noise. Experimental results
based on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets will demonstrate that the proposed
training algorithm achieves client-level privacy protection with performance
gain while enjoying the benefits of low communication overhead from binary
model updates.

<p class="mathjax">Domain generalization person re-identification (DG-ReID) aims to train a
model on source domains and generalize well on unseen domains. Vision
Transformer usually yields better generalization ability than common CNN
networks under distribution shifts. However, Transformer-based ReID models
inevitably over-fit to domain-specific biases due to the supervised learning
strategy on the source domain. We observe that while the global images of
different IDs should have different features, their similar local parts (e.g.,
black backpack) are not bounded by this constraint. Motivated by this, we
propose a pure Transformer model (termed Part-aware Transformer) for DG-ReID by
designing a proxy task, named Cross-ID Similarity Learning (CSL), to mine local
visual information shared by different IDs. This proxy task allows the model to
learn generic features because it only cares about the visual similarity of the
parts regardless of the ID labels, thus alleviating the side effect of
domain-specific biases. Based on the local similarity obtained in CSL, a
Part-guided Self-Distillation (PSD) is proposed to further improve the
generalization of global features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under most DG ReID settings. Under the Market$\to$Duke setting, our
method exceeds state-of-the-art by 10.9% and 12.8% in Rank1 and mAP,
respectively. The code is available at
https://github.com/liyuke65535/Part-Aware-Transformer.

<p class="mathjax">Aiming for a mixbiotic society that combines freedom and solidarity among
people with diverse values, I focused on nonviolent communication (NVC) that
enables compassionate giving in various situations of social division and
conflict, and tried a generative AI for it. Specifically, ChatGPT was used in
place of the traditional certified trainer to test the possibility of mediating
(modifying) input sentences in four processes: observation, feelings, needs,
and requests. The results indicate that there is potential for the application
of generative AI, although not yet at a practical level. Suggested improvement
guidelines included adding model responses, relearning revised responses,
specifying appropriate terminology for each process, and re-asking for required
information. The use of generative AI will be useful initially to assist
certified trainers, to prepare for and review events and workshops, and in the
future to support consensus building and cooperative behavior in digital
democracy, platform cooperatives, and cyber-human social co-operating systems.
It is hoped that the widespread use of NVC mediation using generative AI will
lead to the early realization of a mixbiotic society.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel modular robot system that can self-reconfigure to
achieve omnidirectional movements for collaborative object transportation. Each
robotic module is equipped with a steerable omni-wheel for navigation and is
shaped as a regular icositetragon with a permanent magnet installed on each
corner for stable docking. After aggregating multiple modules and forming a
structure that can cage a target object, we have developed an
optimization-based method to compute the distribution of all wheels' heading
directions, which enables efficient omnidirectional movements of the structure.
By implementing a hierarchical controller on our prototyped system in both
simulation and experiment, we validated the trajectory tracking performance of
an individual module and a team of six modules in multiple navigation and
collaborative object transportation settings. The results demonstrate that the
proposed system can maintain a stable caging formation and achieve smooth
transportation, indicating the effectiveness of our hardware and locomotion
designs.

<p class="mathjax">A wide range of verification methods have been proposed to verify the safety
properties of deep neural networks ensuring that the networks function
correctly in critical applications. However, many well-known verification tools
still struggle with complicated network architectures and large network sizes.
In this work, we propose a network reduction technique as a pre-processing
method prior to verification. The proposed method reduces neural networks via
eliminating stable ReLU neurons, and transforming them into a sequential neural
network consisting of ReLU and Affine layers which can be handled by the most
verification tools. We instantiate the reduction technique on the
state-of-the-art complete and incomplete verification tools, including
alpha-beta-crown, VeriNet and PRIMA. Our experiments on a large set of
benchmarks indicate that the proposed technique can significantly reduce neural
networks and speed up existing verification tools. Furthermore, the experiment
results also show that network reduction can improve the availability of
existing verification tools on many networks by reducing them into sequential
neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">\textit{Federated learning} (FL) is a nascent distributed learning paradigm
to train a shared global model without violating users' privacy. FL has been
shown to be vulnerable to various Byzantine attacks, where malicious
participants could independently or collusively upload well-crafted updates to
deteriorate the performance of the global model. However, existing defenses
could only mitigate part of Byzantine attacks, without providing an all-sided
shield for FL. It is difficult to simply combine them as they rely on totally
contradictory assumptions.
<br />In this paper, we propose FPD, a
\underline{\textbf{f}}our-\underline{\textbf{p}}ronged
\underline{\textbf{d}}efense against both non-colluding and colluding Byzantine
attacks. Our main idea is to utilize absolute similarity to filter updates
rather than relative similarity used in existingI works. To this end, we first
propose a reliable client selection strategy to prevent the majority of threats
in the bud. Then we design a simple but effective score-based detection method
to mitigate colluding attacks. Third, we construct an enhanced spectral-based
outlier detector to accurately discard abnormal updates when the training data
is \textit{not independent and identically distributed} (non-IID). Finally, we
design update denoising to rectify the direction of the slightly noisy but
harmful updates. The four sequentially combined modules can effectively
reconcile the contradiction in addressing non-colluding and colluding Byzantine
attacks. Extensive experiments over three benchmark image classification
datasets against four state-of-the-art Byzantine attacks demonstrate that FPD
drastically outperforms existing defenses in IID and non-IID scenarios (with
$30\%$ improvement on model accuracy).

<p class="mathjax">Deep Attractor Network (DANet) is the state-of-the-art technique in speech
separation field, which uses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM), but
the complexity of the DANet model is very high. In this paper, a simplified and
powerful DANet model is proposed using Bidirectional Gated neural network
(BGRU) instead of BLSTM. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) other than the
k-means was applied in DANet as a clustering algorithm to reduce the complexity
and increase the learning speed and accuracy. The metrics used in this paper
are Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR), Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR),
Signal to Artifact Ratio (SAR), and Perceptual Evaluation Speech Quality (PESQ)
score. Two speaker mixture datasets from TIMIT corpus were prepared to evaluate
the proposed model, and the system achieved 12.3 dB and 2.94 for SDR and PESQ
scores respectively, which were better than the original DANet model. Other
improvements were 20.7% and 17.9% in the number of parameters and time
training, respectively. The model was applied on mixed Arabic speech signals
and the results were better than that in English.

<p class="mathjax">The analysis and mining of user heterogeneous behavior are of paramount
importance in recommendation systems. However, the conventional approach of
incorporating various types of heterogeneous behavior into recommendation
models leads to feature sparsity and knowledge fragmentation issues. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel approach for personalized recommendation via
Large Language Model (LLM), by extracting and fusing heterogeneous knowledge
from user heterogeneous behavior information. In addition, by combining
heterogeneous knowledge and recommendation tasks, instruction tuning is
performed on LLM for personalized recommendations. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate user heterogeneous
behavior and significantly improve recommendation performance.

<p class="mathjax">Near-infrared (NIR) image spectrum translation is a challenging problem with
many promising applications. Existing methods struggle with the mapping
ambiguity between the NIR and the RGB domains, and generalize poorly due to the
limitations of models' learning capabilities and the unavailability of
sufficient NIR-RGB image pairs for training. To address these challenges, we
propose a cooperative learning paradigm that colorizes NIR images in parallel
with another proxy grayscale colorization task by exploring latent cross-domain
priors (i.e., latent spectrum context priors and task domain priors), dubbed
CoColor. The complementary statistical and semantic spectrum information from
these two task domains -- in the forms of pre-trained colorization networks --
are brought in as task domain priors. A bilateral domain translation module is
subsequently designed, in which intermittent NIR images are generated from
grayscale and colorized in parallel with authentic NIR images; and vice versa
for the grayscale images. These intermittent transformations act as latent
spectrum context priors for efficient domain knowledge exchange. We
progressively fine-tune and fuse these modules with a series of pixel-level and
feature-level consistency constraints. Experiments show that our proposed
cooperative learning framework produces satisfactory spectrum translation
outputs with diverse colors and rich textures, and outperforms state-of-the-art
counterparts by 3.95dB and 4.66dB in terms of PNSR for the NIR and grayscale
colorization tasks, respectively.

ArXiv papers published between 2010 and 2020, and then used Palm-2 to generate
295K samples of open-vocabulary multi-turn question-answering dialogues about
the graphs. As context, we provided the text-only Palm-2 with paper title,
abstract, paragraph mentioning the graph, and rich text contextual data from
the graph itself, obtaining dialogues with an average 2.23 question-answer
turns for each graph. We asked GPT-4 to assess the matching quality of our
question-answer turns given the paper's context, obtaining an average rating of
8.7/10 on our 3K test set. We evaluated the 0-shot capability of the most
popular MLLM models such as LLaVa, mPLUGowl, BLIP-2, and openFlamingo's on our
dataset, finding LLaVA-13B being the most performant with a CIDEr score of
0.08. We further enriched the question prompts for LLAVA by including the
serialized data tables extracted from the graphs using the DePlot model,
boosting LLaVA's 0-shot CIDEr to 0.15. To verify the validity of our dataset,
we also fine-tuned LLaVa using our dataset, reaching a substantially higher
CIDEr score of 0.26. We anticipate further accuracy improvement by including
segmentation mask tokens and leveraging larger LLM backbones coupled with
emergent prompting techniques. Our code and data are open-sourced.

<p class="mathjax">The design methodology of congestion control algorithms (CCAs) has shifted
from control-based to measurement-based in recent years. However, we find that
measurement-based CCAs, although having better performance, are not robust
enough in fluctuating network environments, which are increasingly common
nowadays. In this paper, we propose PAD to make measurement-based CCAs as
robust as control-based CCAs in fluctuating environments while enjoying the
performance benefits in general. PAD identifies that the root cause is that
measurement-based CCAs blindly rely on measurement results, which unfortunately
can be inaccurate, and will transiently mislead the CCAs to misbehave. The
preliminary design of PAD works as a shim layer between the socket and CCAs so
as to scale to any measurement-based CCAs, which turns out to outperform most
commonly used CCAs in fluctuating environments.

<p class="mathjax">Communication is crucial for solving cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning tasks in Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes. Existing
works often rely on black-box methods to encode local information/features into
messages shared with other agents. However, such black-box approaches are
unable to provide any quantitative guarantees on the expected return and often
lead to the generation of continuous messages with high communication overhead
and poor interpretability. In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the
return gap between an ideal policy with full observability and an optimal
partially-observable policy with discrete communication. This result enables us
to recast multi-agent communication into a novel online clustering problem over
the local observations at each agent, with messages as cluster labels and the
upper bound on the return gap as clustering loss. By minimizing the upper
bound, we propose a surprisingly simple design of message generation functions
in multi-agent communication and integrate it with reinforcement learning using
a Regularized Information Maximization loss function. Evaluations show that the
proposed discrete communication significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
multi-agent communication baselines and can achieve nearly-optimal returns with
few-bit messages that are naturally interpretable.

<p class="mathjax">With the emergence of VR and AR, 360{\deg} data attracts increasing attention
from the computer vision and multimedia communities. Typically, 360{\deg} data
is projected into 2D ERP (equirectangular projection) images for feature
extraction. However, existing methods cannot handle the distortions that result
from the projection, hindering the development of 360-data-based tasks.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Transformer-based model called DATFormer
to address the distortion problem. We tackle this issue from two perspectives.
Firstly, we introduce two distortion-adaptive modules. The first is a
Distortion Mapping Module, which guides the model to pre-adapt to distorted
features globally. The second module is a Distortion-Adaptive Attention Block
that reduces local distortions on multi-scale features. Secondly, to exploit
the unique characteristics of 360{\deg} data, we present a learnable relation
matrix and use it as part of the positional embedding to further improve
performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, and
the results show that our model outperforms existing 2D SOD (salient object
detection) and 360 SOD methods.

<p class="mathjax">The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has been
revolutionary, especially with the recent advancements in transformer-based
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the task of understanding unstructured
electronic medical records remains a challenge given the nature of the records
(e.g., disorganization, inconsistency, and redundancy) and the inability of
LLMs to derive reasoning paradigms that allow for comprehensive understanding
of medical variables. In this work, we examine the power of coupling symbolic
reasoning with language modeling toward improved understanding of unstructured
clinical texts. We show that such a combination improves the extraction of
several medical variables from unstructured records. In addition, we show that
the state-of-the-art commercially-free LLMs enjoy retrieval capabilities
comparable to those provided by their commercial counterparts. Finally, we
elaborate on the need for LLM steering through the application of symbolic
reasoning as the exclusive use of LLMs results in the lowest performance.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Learning has empowered us to train neural networks for complex data with
high performance. However, with the growing research, several vulnerabilities
in neural networks have been exposed. A particular branch of research,
Adversarial Machine Learning, exploits and understands some of the
vulnerabilities that cause the neural networks to misclassify for near original
input. A class of algorithms called adversarial attacks is proposed to make the
neural networks misclassify for various tasks in different domains. With the
extensive and growing research in adversarial attacks, it is crucial to
understand the classification of adversarial attacks. This will help us
understand the vulnerabilities in a systematic order and help us to mitigate
the effects of adversarial attacks. This article provides a survey of existing
adversarial attacks and their understanding based on different perspectives. We
also provide a brief overview of existing adversarial defences and their
limitations in mitigating the effect of adversarial attacks. Further, we
conclude with a discussion on the future research directions in the field of
adversarial machine learning.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer has recently gained considerable popularity in low-level vision
tasks, including image super-resolution (SR). These networks utilize
self-attention along different dimensions, spatial or channel, and achieve
impressive performance. This inspires us to combine the two dimensions in
Transformer for a more powerful representation capability. Based on the above
idea, we propose a novel Transformer model, Dual Aggregation Transformer (DAT),
for image SR. Our DAT aggregates features across spatial and channel
dimensions, in the inter-block and intra-block dual manner. Specifically, we
alternately apply spatial and channel self-attention in consecutive Transformer
blocks. The alternate strategy enables DAT to capture the global context and
realize inter-block feature aggregation. Furthermore, we propose the adaptive
interaction module (AIM) and the spatial-gate feed-forward network (SGFN) to
achieve intra-block feature aggregation. AIM complements two self-attention
mechanisms from corresponding dimensions. Meanwhile, SGFN introduces additional
non-linear spatial information in the feed-forward network. Extensive
experiments show that our DAT surpasses current methods. Code and models are
obtainable at https://github.com/zhengchen1999/DAT.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot and zero-shot entity linking focus on the tail and emerging
entities, which are more challenging but closer to real-world scenarios. The
mainstream method is the ''retrieve and rerank'' two-stage framework. In this
paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine lexicon-based retriever to retrieve entity
candidates in an effective manner, which operates in two layers. The first
layer retrieves coarse-grained candidates by leveraging entity names, while the
second layer narrows down the search to fine-grained candidates within the
coarse-grained ones. In addition, this second layer utilizes entity
descriptions to effectively disambiguate tail or new entities that share names
with existing popular entities. Experimental results indicate that our approach
can obtain superior performance without requiring extensive finetuning in the
retrieval stage. Notably, our approach ranks the 1st in NLPCC 2023 Shared Task
6 on Chinese Few-shot and Zero-shot Entity Linking.

<p class="mathjax">In many recommender problems, a handful of popular items (e.g. movies/TV
shows, news etc.) can be dominant in recommendations for many users. However,
we know that in a large catalog of items, users are likely interested in more
than what is popular. The dominance of popular items may mean that users will
not see items they would likely enjoy. In this paper, we propose a technique to
overcome this problem using adversarial machine learning. We define a metric to
translate user-level utility metric in terms of an advantage/disadvantage over
items. We subsequently use that metric in an adversarial learning framework to
systematically promote disadvantaged items. The resulting algorithm identifies
semantically meaningful items that get promoted in the learning algorithm. In
the empirical study, we evaluate the proposed technique on three publicly
available datasets and four competitive baselines. The result shows that our
proposed method not only improves the coverage, but also, surprisingly,
improves the overall performance.

<p class="mathjax">Fact-checking is a popular countermeasure against misinformation but the
massive volume of information online has spurred active research in the
automation of the task. Like expert fact-checking, it is not enough for an
automated fact-checker to just be accurate, but also be able to inform and
convince the user of the validity of its prediction. This becomes viable with
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In this work, we conduct a study of
XAI fact-checkers involving 180 participants to determine how users' actions
towards news and their attitudes towards explanations are affected by the XAI.
Our results suggest that XAI has limited effects on users' agreement with the
veracity prediction of the automated fact-checker and on their intents to share
news. However, XAI does nudge them towards forming uniform judgments of news
veracity, thereby signaling a reliance on the explanations. We also found
polarizing preferences towards XAI, raising several design considerations on
these.

<p class="mathjax">Class-incremental learning (CIL) has achieved remarkable successes in
learning new classes consecutively while overcoming catastrophic forgetting on
old categories. However, most existing CIL methods unreasonably assume that all
old categories have the same forgetting pace, and neglect negative influence of
forgetting heterogeneity among different old classes on forgetting
compensation. To surmount the above challenges, we develop a novel
Heterogeneous Forgetting Compensation (HFC) model, which can resolve
heterogeneous forgetting of easy-to-forget and hard-to-forget old categories
from both representation and gradient aspects. Specifically, we design a
task-semantic aggregation block to alleviate heterogeneous forgetting from
representation aspect. It aggregates local category information within each
task to learn task-shared global representations. Moreover, we develop two
novel plug-and-play losses: a gradient-balanced forgetting compensation loss
and a gradient-balanced relation distillation loss to alleviate forgetting from
gradient aspect. They consider gradient-balanced compensation to rectify
forgetting heterogeneity of old categories and heterogeneous relation
consistency. Experiments on several representative datasets illustrate
effectiveness of our HFC model. The code is available at
https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HFC.

<p class="mathjax">Training helps to maintain and improve sufficient muscle function, body
control, and body coordination. These are important to reduce the risk of
fracture incidents caused by falls, especially for the elderly or people
recovering from injury. Virtual reality training can offer a cost-effective and
individualized training experience. We present an application for the HoloLens
2 to enable musculoskeletal training for elderly and impaired persons to allow
for autonomous training and automatic progress evaluation. We designed a
virtual downhill skiing scenario that is controlled by body movement to
stimulate balance and body control. By adapting the parameters of the ski
slope, we can tailor the intensity of the training to individual users. In this
work, we evaluate whether the movement data of the HoloLens 2 alone is
sufficient to control and predict body movement and joint angles during
musculoskeletal training. We record the movements of 10 healthy volunteers with
external tracking cameras and track a set of body and joint angles of the
participant during training. We estimate correlation coefficients and
systematically analyze whether whole body movement can be derived from the
movement data of the HoloLens 2. No participant reports movement sickness
effects and all were able to quickly interact and control their movement during
skiing. Our results show a high correlation between HoloLens 2 movement data
and the external tracking of the upper body movement and joint angles of the
lower limbs.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is dedicated to a robust ordinal method for learning the
preferences of a decision maker between subsets. The decision model, derived
from Fishburn and LaValle (1996) and whose parameters we learn, is general
enough to be compatible with any strict weak order on subsets, thanks to the
consideration of possible interactions between elements. Moreover, we accept
not to predict some preferences if the available preference data are not
compatible with a reliable prediction. A predicted preference is considered
reliable if all the simplest models (Occam's razor) explaining the preference
data agree on it. Following the robust ordinal regression methodology, our
predictions are based on an uncertainty set encompassing the possible values of
the model parameters. We define a robust ordinal dominance relation between
subsets and we design a procedure to determine whether this dominance relation
holds. Numerical tests are provided on synthetic and real-world data to
evaluate the richness and reliability of the preference predictions made.

<p class="mathjax">As the core of the Knowledge Tracking (KT) task, assessing students' dynamic
mastery of knowledge concepts is crucial for both offline teaching and online
educational applications. Since students' mastery of knowledge concepts is
often unlabeled, existing KT methods rely on the implicit paradigm of
historical practice to mastery of knowledge concepts to students' responses to
practices to address the challenge of unlabeled concept mastery. However,
purely predicting student responses without imposing specific constraints on
hidden concept mastery values does not guarantee the accuracy of these
intermediate values as concept mastery values. To address this issue, we
propose a principled approach called Counterfactual Monotonic Knowledge Tracing
(CMKT), which builds on the implicit paradigm described above by using a
counterfactual assumption to constrain the evolution of students' mastery of
knowledge concepts.

<p class="mathjax">Friedrichs' systems (FS) are symmetric positive linear systems of first-order
partial differential equations (PDEs), which provide a unified framework for
describing various elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic semi-linear PDEs such as
the linearized Euler equations of gas dynamics, the equations of compressible
linear elasticity and the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system. FS were studied to
approximate PDEs of mixed elliptic and hyperbolic type in the same domain. For
this and other reasons, the versatility of the discontinuous Galerkin method
(DGM) represents the best approximation space for FS. We implement a
distributed memory solver for stationary FS in deal.II. Our focus is model
order reduction. Since FS model hyperbolic PDEs, they often suffer from a slow
Kolmogorov n-width decay. We develop two approaches to tackle this problem. The
first is domain decomposable reduced-order models (DD-ROMs). We will show that
the DGM offers a natural formulation of DD-ROMs, in particular regarding
interface penalties, compared to the continuous finite element method. We also
develop new repartitioning strategies to obtain more efficient local
approximations of the solution manifold. The second approach involves graph
neural networks used to infer the limit of a succession of projection-based
linear ROMs corresponding to lower viscosity constants: the heuristic behind is
to develop a multi-fidelity super-resolution paradigm to mimic the mathematical
convergence to vanishing viscosity solutions while exploiting to the most
interpretable and certified projection-based ROMs.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, there has been a growing interest in constructing deep learning
schemes for Low-Light Vision (LLV). Existing techniques primarily focus on
designing task-specific and data-dependent vision models on the standard RGB
domain, which inherently contain latent data associations. In this study, we
propose a generic low-light vision solution by introducing a generative block
to convert data from the RAW to the RGB domain. This novel approach connects
diverse vision problems by explicitly depicting data generation, which is the
first in the field. To precisely characterize the latent correspondence between
the generative procedure and the vision task, we establish a bilevel model with
the parameters of the generative block defined as the upper level and the
parameters of the vision task defined as the lower level. We further develop
two types of learning strategies targeting different goals, namely low cost and
high accuracy, to acquire a new bilevel generative learning paradigm. The
generative blocks embrace a strong generalization ability in other low-light
vision tasks through the bilevel optimization on enhancement tasks. Extensive
experimental evaluations on three representative low-light vision tasks, namely
enhancement, detection, and segmentation, fully demonstrate the superiority of
our proposed approach. The code will be available at
https://github.com/Yingchi1998/BGL.

<p class="mathjax">Robotics and automation are poised to change the landscape of home and work
in the near future. Robots are adept at deliberately moving, sensing, and
interacting with their environments. The pervasive use of this technology
promises societal and economic payoffs due to its capabilities - conversely,
the capabilities of robots to move within and sense the world around them is
susceptible to abuse. Robots, unlike typical sensors, are inherently
autonomous, active, and deliberate. Such automated agents can become AI double
agents liable to violate the privacy of coworkers, privileged spaces, and other
stakeholders. In this work we highlight the understudied and inevitable threats
to privacy that can be posed by the autonomous, deliberate motions and sensing
of robots. We frame the problem within broader sociotechnological questions
alongside a comprehensive review. The privacy-aware motion planning problem is
formulated in terms of cost functions that can be modified to induce
privacy-aware behavior - preserving, agnostic, or violating. Simulated case
studies in manipulation and navigation, with altered cost functions, are used
to demonstrate how privacy-violating threats can be easily injected, sometimes
with only small changes in performance (solution path lengths). Such
functionality is already widely available. This preliminary work is meant to
lay the foundations for near-future, holistic, interdisciplinary investigations
that can address questions surrounding privacy in intelligent robotic behaviors
determined by planning algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">The combination of Visual Guidance and Extended Reality (XR) technology holds
the potential to greatly improve the performance of human workforces in
numerous areas, particularly industrial environments. Focusing on virtual
assembly tasks and making use of different forms of supportive visualisations,
this study investigates the potential of XR Visual Guidance. Set in a web-based
immersive environment, our results draw from a heterogeneous pool of 199
participants. This research is designed to significantly differ from previous
exploratory studies, which yielded conflicting results on user performance and
associated human factors. Our results clearly show the advantages of XR Visual
Guidance based on an over 50\% reduction in task completion times and mistakes
made; this may further be enhanced and refined using specific frameworks and
other forms of visualisations/Visual Guidance. Discussing the role of other
factors, such as cognitive load, motivation, and usability, this paper also
seeks to provide concrete avenues for future research and practical takeaways
for practitioners.

<p class="mathjax">A slow decaying Kolmogorov n-width of the solution manifold of a parametric
partial differential equation precludes the realization of efficient linear
projection-based reduced-order models. This is due to the high dimensionality
of the reduced space needed to approximate with sufficient accuracy the
solution manifold. To solve this problem, neural networks, in the form of
different architectures, have been employed to build accurate nonlinear
regressions of the solution manifolds. However, the majority of the
implementations are non-intrusive black-box surrogate models, and only a part
of them perform dimension reduction from the number of degrees of freedom of
the discretized parametric models to a latent dimension. We present a new
intrusive and explicable methodology for reduced-order modelling that employs
neural networks for solution manifold approximation but that does not discard
the physical and numerical models underneath in the predictive/online stage. We
will focus on autoencoders used to compress further the dimensionality of
linear approximants of solution manifolds, achieving in the end a nonlinear
dimension reduction. After having obtained an accurate nonlinear approximant,
we seek for the solutions on the latent manifold with the residual-based
nonlinear least-squares Petrov-Galerkin method, opportunely hyper-reduced in
order to be independent from the number of degrees of freedom. New adaptive
hyper-reduction strategies are developed along with the employment of local
nonlinear approximants. We test our methodology on two nonlinear time-dependent
parametric benchmarks involving a supersonic flow past a NACA airfoil with
changing Mach number and an incompressible turbulent flow around the Ahmed body
with changing slant angle.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential recommendation addresses the issue of preference drift by
predicting the next item based on the user's previous behaviors. Recently, a
promising approach using contrastive learning has emerged, demonstrating its
effectiveness in recommending items under sparse user-item interactions.
Significantly, the effectiveness of combinations of various augmentation
methods has been demonstrated in different domains, particularly in computer
vision. However, when it comes to augmentation within a contrastive learning
framework in sequential recommendation, previous research has only focused on
limited conditions and simple structures. Thus, it is still possible to extend
existing approaches to boost the effects of augmentation methods by using
progressed structures with the combinations of multiple augmentation methods.
In this work, we propose a novel framework called Hierarchical Contrastive
Learning with Multiple Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation(HCLRec) to
overcome the aforementioned limitation. Our framework leverages existing
augmentation methods hierarchically to improve performance. By combining
augmentation methods continuously, we generate low-level and high-level view
pairs. We employ a Transformers-based model to encode the input sequence
effectively. Furthermore, we introduce additional blocks consisting of
Transformers and position-wise feed-forward network(PFFN) layers to learn the
invariance of the original sequences from hierarchically augmented views. We
pass the input sequence to subsequent layers based on the number of increment
levels applied to the views to handle various augmentation levels. Within each
layer, we compute contrastive loss between pairs of views at the same level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches and that HCLRec is robust even when faced with the
problem of sparse interaction.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we propose a novel abstraction that we have named
Range-Revocable Pseudonyms (RRPs). RRPs are a new class of pseudonyms whose
validity can be revoked for any time-range within its original validity period.
The key feature of RRPs is that the information provided to revoke a pseudonym
for a given timerange cannot be linked with the information provided when using
the pseudonym outside the revoked range. We provide an algorithm to implement
RRPs using efficient cryptographic primitives where the space complexity of the
pseudonym is constant, regardless of the granularity of the revocation range,
and the space complexity of the revocation information only grows
logarithmically with the granularity; this makes the use of RRPs far more
efficient than the use of many short-lived pseudonyms. We have used RRPs to
design EDGAR, an access control system for VANET scenarios that offers backward
unlinkability. The experimental evaluation of EDGAR shows that, when using
RRPs, the revocation can be performed efficiently (even when using time slots
as small as 1 second) and that users can authenticate with low latency
($0.5-3.5$ ms).

<p class="mathjax">The accurate assessment of fish stocks is crucial for sustainable fisheries
management. However, existing statistical stock assessment models can have low
forecast performance of relevant stock parameters like recruitment or spawning
stock biomass, especially in ecosystems that are changing due to global warming
and other anthropogenic stressors. In this paper, we investigate the use of
machine learning models to improve the estimation and forecast of such stock
parameters. We propose a hybrid model that combines classical statistical stock
assessment models with supervised ML, specifically gradient boosted trees. Our
hybrid model leverages the initial estimate provided by the classical model and
uses the ML model to make a post-hoc correction to improve accuracy. We
experiment with five different stocks and find that the forecast accuracy of
recruitment and spawning stock biomass improves considerably in most cases.

<p class="mathjax">The use of Air traffic management (ATM) simulators for planing and operations
can be challenging due to their modelling complexity. This paper presents XALM
(eXplainable Active Learning Metamodel), a three-step framework integrating
active learning and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values into simulation
metamodels for supporting ATM decision-making. XALM efficiently uncovers hidden
relationships among input and output variables in ATM simulators, those usually
of interest in policy analysis. Our experiments show XALM's predictive
performance comparable to the XGBoost metamodel with fewer simulations.
Additionally, XALM exhibits superior explanatory capabilities compared to
non-active learning metamodels.
<br />Using the `Mercury' (flight and passenger) ATM simulator, XALM is applied to
a real-world scenario in Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, extending an arrival
manager's range and scope by analysing six variables. This case study
illustrates XALM's effectiveness in enhancing simulation interpretability and
understanding variable interactions. By addressing computational challenges and
improving explainability, XALM complements traditional simulation-based
analyses.
<br />Lastly, we discuss two practical approaches for reducing the computational
burden of the metamodelling further: we introduce a stopping criterion for
active learning based on the inherent uncertainty of the metamodel, and we show
how the simulations used for the metamodel can be reused across key performance
indicators, thus decreasing the overall number of simulations needed.

<p class="mathjax">The explosive growth of computation and energy cost of artificial
intelligence has spurred strong interests in new computing modalities as
potential alternatives to conventional electronic processors. Photonic
processors that execute operations using photons instead of electrons, have
promised to enable optical neural networks with ultra-low latency and power
consumption. However, existing optical neural networks, limited by the
underlying network designs, have achieved image recognition accuracy much lower
than state-of-the-art electronic neural networks. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing a large-kernel spatially-varying convolutional neural
network learned via low-dimensional reparameterization techniques. We
experimentally instantiate the network with a flat meta-optical system that
encompasses an array of nanophotonic structures designed to induce
angle-dependent responses. Combined with an extremely lightweight electronic
backend with approximately 2K parameters we demonstrate a nanophotonic neural
network reaches 73.80\% blind test classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset,
and, as such, the first time, an optical neural network outperforms the first
modern digital neural network -- AlexNet (72.64\%) with 57M parameters,

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the tokens of images share the same static data flow in many dense
networks. However, challenges arise from the variance among the objects in
images, such as large variations in the spatial scale and difficulties of
recognition for visual entities. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent
token routing strategy to elaborate the routing paths of image tokens for
Dynamic Vision Transformer, dubbed DiT. The proposed framework generates a
data-dependent path per token, adapting to the object scales and visual
discrimination of tokens. In feed-forward, the differentiable routing gates are
designed to select the scaling paths and feature transformation paths for image
tokens, leading to multi-path feature propagation. In this way, the impact of
object scales and visual discrimination of image representation can be
carefully tuned. Moreover, the computational cost can be further reduced by
giving budget constraints to the routing gate and early-stopping of feature
extraction. In experiments, our DiT achieves superior performance and favorable
complexity/accuracy trade-offs than many SoTA methods on ImageNet
classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic
segmentation. Particularly, the DiT-B5 obtains 84.8\% top-1 Acc on ImageNet
with 10.3 GFLOPs, which is 1.0\% higher than that of the SoTA method with
similar computational complexity. These extensive results demonstrate that DiT
can serve as versatile backbones for various vision tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Obtaining labelled data to train deep learning methods for estimating animal
pose is challenging. Recently, synthetic data has been widely used for pose
estimation tasks, but most methods still rely on supervised learning paradigms
utilising synthetic images and labels. Can training be fully unsupervised? Is a
tiny synthetic dataset sufficient? What are the minimum assumptions that we
could make for estimating animal pose? Our proposal addresses these questions
through a simple yet effective self-supervised method that only assumes the
availability of unlabelled images and a small set of synthetic 2D poses. We
completely remove the need for any 3D or 2D pose annotations (or complex 3D
animal models), and surprisingly our approach can still learn accurate 3D and
2D poses simultaneously. We train our method with unlabelled images of horses
mainly collected for YouTube videos and a prior consisting of 2D synthetic
poses. The latter is three times smaller than the number of images needed for
training. We test our method on a challenging set of horse images and evaluate
the predicted 3D and 2D poses. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn
accurate animal poses even with as few assumptions as unlabelled images and a
small set of 2D poses generated from synthetic data. Given the minimum
requirements and the abundance of unlabelled data, our method could be easily
deployed to different animals.

<p class="mathjax">While current face animation methods can manipulate expressions individually,
they suffer from several limitations. The expressions manipulated by some
motion-based facial reenactment models are crude. Other ideas modeled with
facial action units cannot generalize to arbitrary expressions not covered by
annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Geometry-aware Facial
Expression Translation (GaFET) framework, which is based on parametric 3D
facial representations and can stably decoupled expression. Among them, a
Multi-level Feature Aligned Transformer is proposed to complement non-geometric
facial detail features while addressing the alignment challenge of spatial
features. Further, we design a De-expression model based on StyleGAN, in order
to reduce the learning difficulty of GaFET in unpaired "in-the-wild" images.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that we achieve
higher-quality and more accurate facial expression transfer results compared to
state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate applicability of various poses and
complex textures. Besides, videos or annotated training data are omitted,
making our method easier to use and generalize.

<p class="mathjax">The challenge of low-latency speech translation has recently draw significant
interest in the research community as shown by several publications and shared
tasks. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in
realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems
are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches.
<br />In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the
various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions.
The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the
segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components.
<br />Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation
using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output
as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare
state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems. Finally, the framework
allows to automatically evaluate the translation quality as well as latency and
also provides a web interface to show the low-latency model outputs to the
user.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a novel adaptive grid mapping approach, the Adaptive
Patched Grid Map, which enables a situational aware grid based perception for
autonomous vehicles. Its structure allows a flexible representation of the
surrounding unstructured environment. By splitting types of information into
separate layers less memory is allocated when data is unevenly or sporadically
available. However, layers must be resampled during the fusion process to cope
with dynamically changing cell sizes. Therefore, we propose a novel spatial
cell fusion approach. Together with the proposed fusion framework, dynamically
changing external requirements, such as cell resolution specifications and
horizon targets, are considered. For our evaluation, real-world data were
recorded from an autonomous vehicle driving through various traffic situations.
Based on this, the memory efficiency is compared to other approaches, and
fusion execution times are determined. The results confirm the adaptation to
requirement changes and a significant memory usage reduction.

<p class="mathjax">While privacy-focused browsers have taken steps to block third-party cookies
and browser fingerprinting, novel tracking methods that bypass existing
defenses continue to emerge. Since trackers need to exfiltrate information from
the client- to server-side through link decoration regardless of the tracking
technique they employ, a promising orthogonal approach is to detect and
sanitize tracking information in decorated links. We present PURL, a
machine-learning approach that leverages a cross-layer graph representation of
webpage execution to safely and effectively sanitize link decoration. Our
evaluation shows that PURL significantly outperforms existing countermeasures
in terms of accuracy and reducing website breakage while being robust to common
evasion techniques. We use PURL to perform a measurement study on top-million
websites. We find that link decorations are widely abused by well-known
advertisers and trackers to exfiltrate user information collected from browser
storage, email addresses, and scripts involved in fingerprinting.

<p class="mathjax">Vulnerabilities from third-party libraries (TPLs) have been unveiled to
threaten the Maven ecosystem. Despite patches being released promptly after
vulnerabilities are disclosed, the libraries and applications in the community
still use the vulnerable versions, which makes the vulnerabilities persistent
in the Maven ecosystem (e.g., the notorious Log4Shell still greatly influences
the Maven ecosystem nowadays from 2021). Both academic and industrial
researchers have proposed user-oriented standards and solutions to address
vulnerabilities, while such solutions fail to tackle the ecosystem-wide
persistent vulnerabilities because it requires a collective effort from the
community to timely adopt patches without introducing breaking issues.
<br />To seek an ecosystem-wide solution, we first carried out an empirical study
to examine the prevalence of persistent vulnerabilities in the Maven ecosystem.
Then, we identified affected libraries for alerts by implementing an algorithm
monitoring downstream dependents of vulnerabilities based on an up-to-date
dependency graph. Based on them, we further quantitatively revealed that
patches blocked by upstream libraries caused the persistence of
vulnerabilities. After reviewing the drawbacks of existing countermeasures, to
address them, we proposed a solution for range restoration (Ranger) to
automatically restore the compatible and secure version ranges of dependencies
for downstream dependents. The automatic restoration requires no manual effort
from the community, and the code-centric compatibility assurance ensures smooth
upgrades to patched versions. Moreover, Ranger along with the ecosystem
monitoring can timely alert developers of blocking libraries and suggest
flexible version ranges to rapidly unblock patch versions. By evaluation,
Ranger could restore 75.64% of ranges which automatically remediated 90.32% of
vulnerable downstream projects.

<p class="mathjax">High-level penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) has
introduced significant uncertainties into modern power systems. In order to
rapidly and economically respond to the fluctuations of power system operating
state, this paper proposes a safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) based
method for fast solution of real-time optimal power flow (RT-OPF) problems. The
proposed method considers the volatility of RESs and temporal constraints, and
formulates the RT-OPF as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). In the
training process, the proposed method hybridizes the proximal policy
optimization (PPO) and the primal-dual method. Instead of integrating the
constraint violation penalty with the reward function, its actor gradients are
estimated by a Lagrange advantage function which is derived from two critic
systems based on economic reward and violation cost. The decoupling of reward
and cost alleviates reward sparsity while improving critic approximation
accuracy. Moreover, the introduction of Lagrange multipliers enables the agent
to comprehend the trade-off between optimality and feasibility. Numerical tests
are carried out and compared with penalty-based DRL methods on the IEEE 9-bus,
30-bus, and 118-bus test systems. The results show that the well-trained SDRL
agent can significantly improve the computation efficiency while satisfying the
security constraints and optimality requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Existing large language models have to run K times to generate a sequence of
K tokens. In this paper, we present RecycleGPT, a generative language model
with fast decoding speed by recycling pre-generated model states without
running the whole model in multiple steps. Our approach relies on the
observation that adjacent tokens in a sequence usually have strong correlations
and the next token in a sequence can be reasonably guessed or inferred based on
the preceding ones. Through theoretical evaluations and practical tests on
downstream text generation tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in lowering inference latency, achieving up to 1.4x speedup while
preserving high performance.

<p class="mathjax">Conversational Question Answering (CQA) is a challenging task that aims to
generate natural answers for conversational flow questions. In this paper, we
propose a pluggable approach for extractive methods that introduces a novel
prompt-guided copy mechanism to improve the fluency and appropriateness of the
extracted answers. Our approach uses prompts to link questions to answers and
employs attention to guide the copy mechanism to verify the naturalness of
extracted answers, making necessary edits to ensure that the answers are fluent
and appropriate. The three prompts, including a question-rationale relationship
prompt, a question description prompt, and a conversation history prompt,
enhance the copy mechanism's performance. Our experiments demonstrate that this
approach effectively promotes the generation of natural answers and achieves
good results in the CoQA challenge.

<p class="mathjax">Chinese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction presents
significant challenges due to the Chinese language's unique features, including
a large character set and borderless, morpheme-based structure. Current
mainstream models often struggle with effectively utilizing word-level features
and phonetic information. This paper introduces a novel approach that
incorporates a dynamic error scaling mechanism to detect and correct
phonetically erroneous text generated by ASR output. This mechanism operates by
dynamically fusing word-level features and phonetic information, thereby
enriching the model with additional semantic data. Furthermore, our method
implements unique error reduction and amplification strategies to address the
issues of matching wrong words caused by incorrect characters. Experimental
results indicate substantial improvements in ASR error correction,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method and yielding promising
results on established datasets.

Language-Model-Driven Query Planning, a new paradigm of query planning that
uses Language Models to translate natural language queries into executable

plans can contain complex operators that are able to process arbitrary

Finally, we discuss several ideas to improve the query planning capabilities of

<p class="mathjax">With recent advancements in natural language processing, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for various real-world
applications. Despite their prowess, the intrinsic generative abilities of LLMs
may prove insufficient for handling complex tasks which necessitate a
combination of task planning and the usage of external tools. In this paper, we
first propose a structured framework tailored for LLM-based AI Agents and
discuss the crucial capabilities necessary for tackling intricate problems.
Within this framework, we design two distinct types of agents (i.e., one-step
agent and sequential agent) to execute the inference process. Subsequently, we
instantiate the framework using various LLMs and evaluate their Task Planning
and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities on typical tasks. By highlighting key findings
and challenges, our goal is to provide a helpful resource for researchers and
practitioners to leverage the power of LLMs in their AI applications. Our study
emphasizes the substantial potential of these models, while also identifying
areas that need more investigation and improvement.

<p class="mathjax">The shock instability problem commonly arises in flow simulations involving
strong shocks, particularly when employing high-order schemes, limiting their
applications in hypersonic flow simulations. This study focuses on exploring
the numerical characteristics and underlying mechanisms of shock instabilities
in fifth-order finite-volume WENO schemes. To this end, for the first time, we
have established the matrix stability analysis method for the fifth-order
scheme. By predicting the evolution of perturbation errors in the exponential
growth stage, this method provides quantitative insights into the behavior of
shock-capturing and helps elucidate the mechanisms that cause shock
instabilities. Results reveal that even dissipative solvers also suffer from
shock instabilities when the spatial accuracy is increased to fifth-order.
Further investigation indicates that this is due to the excessively high
spatial accuracy of the WENO scheme near the numerical shock structure.
Moreover, the shock instability problem of fifth-order schemes is demonstrated
to be a multidimensional coupling problem. To stably capture strong shocks, it
is crucial to have sufficient dissipation on transverse faces and ensure at
least two points within the numerical shock structure in the direction
perpendicular to the shock. The source location of instability is also
clarified by the matrix stability analysis method, revealing that the
instability arises from the numerical shock structure. Additionally, stability
analysis demonstrates that local characteristic decomposition helps mitigate
shock instabilities in high-order schemes, although the instability still
persists. These conclusions pave the way for a better understanding of the
shock instability in fifth-order schemes and provide guidance for the
development of more reliable high-order shock-capturing methods for
compressible flows with high Mach numbers.

<p class="mathjax">The Attention module finds common usage in language modeling, presenting
distinct challenges within the broader scope of Natural Language Processing.
Multi-Head Attention (MHA) employs an absolute positional encoding, which
imposes limitations on token length and entails substantial memory consumption
during the processing of embedded inputs. The current remedy proposed by
researchers involves the utilization of relative positional encoding, similar
to the approach adopted in Transformer-XL or Relative Multi-Head Attention
(RMHA), albeit the employed architecture consumes considerable memory
resources. To address these challenges, this study endeavors to refine MHA,
leveraging relative positional encoding in conjunction with the Depth-Wise
Convolutional Layer architecture, which promises heightened accuracy coupled
with minimized memory usage. The proposed RCMHA framework entails the
modification of two integral components: firstly, the application of the
Depth-Wise Convolutional Layer to the input embedding, encompassing Query, Key,
and Value parameters; secondly, the incorporation of Relative Positional
Encoding into the attention scoring phase, harmoniously integrated with Scaled
Dot-Product Attention. Empirical experiments underscore the advantages of
RCMHA, wherein it exhibits superior accuracy, boasting a score of 0.572 in
comparison to alternative attention modules such as MHA, Multi-DConv-Head
Attention (MDHA), and RMHA. Concerning memory utilization, RMHA emerges as the
most frugal, demonstrating an average consumption of 2.98 GB, surpassing RMHA
which necessitates 3.5 GB.

<p class="mathjax">Cued Speech (CS) is a visual coding tool to encode spoken languages at the
phonetic level, which combines lip-reading and hand gestures to effectively
assist communication among people with hearing impairments. The Automatic CS
Recognition (ACSR) task aims to recognize CS videos into linguistic texts,
which involves both lips and hands as two distinct modalities conveying
complementary information. However, the traditional centralized training
approach poses potential privacy risks due to the use of facial and gesture
videos in CS data. To address this issue, we propose a new Federated Cued
Speech Recognition (FedCSR) framework to train an ACSR model over the
decentralized CS data without sharing private information. In particular, a
mutual knowledge distillation method is proposed to maintain cross-modal
semantic consistency of the Non-IID CS data, which ensures learning a unified
feature space for both linguistic and visual information. On the server side, a
globally shared linguistic model is trained to capture the long-term
dependencies in the text sentences, which is aligned with the visual
information from the local clients via visual-to-linguistic distillation. On
the client side, the visual model of each client is trained with its own local
data, assisted by linguistic-to-visual distillation treating the linguistic
model as the teacher. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach
to consider the federated ACSR task for privacy protection. Experimental
results on the Chinese CS dataset with multiple cuers demonstrate that our
approach outperforms both mainstream federated learning baselines and existing
centralized state-of-the-art ACSR methods, achieving 9.7% performance
improvement for character error rate (CER) and 15.0% for word error rate (WER).

<p class="mathjax">The focus of this paper is on the concurrent reconstruction of both the
diffusion and potential coefficients present in an elliptic/parabolic equation,
utilizing two internal measurements of the solutions. A decoupled algorithm is
constructed to sequentially recover these two parameters. In the first step, we
implement a straightforward reformulation that results in a standard problem of
identifying the diffusion coefficient. This coefficient is then numerically
recovered, with no requirement for knowledge of the potential, by utilizing an
output least-square method coupled with finite element discretization. In the
second step, the previously recovered diffusion coefficient is employed to
reconstruct the potential coefficient, applying a method similar to the first
step. Our approach is stimulated by a constructive conditional stability, and
we provide rigorous a priori error estimates in $L^2(\Omega)$ for the recovered
diffusion and potential coefficients. Our approach is stimulated by a
constructive conditional stability, and we provide rigorous a priori error
estimates in $L^2(\Omega)$ for the recovered diffusion and potential
coefficients. To derive these estimates, we develop a weighted energy argument
and suitable positivity conditions. These estimates offer a beneficial guide
for choosing regularization parameters and discretization mesh sizes, in
accordance with the noise level. Some numerical experiments are presented to
demonstrate the accuracy of the numerical scheme and support our theoretical
results.

<p class="mathjax">A knowledge graph is a powerful representation of real-world entities and
their relations. The vast majority of these relations are defined as positive
statements, but the importance of negative statements is increasingly
recognized, especially under an Open World Assumption. Explicitly considering
negative statements has been shown to improve performance on tasks such as
entity summarization and question answering or domain-specific tasks such as
protein function prediction. However, no attention has been given to the
exploration of negative statements by knowledge graph embedding approaches
despite the potential of negative statements to produce more accurate
representations of entities in a knowledge graph.
<br />We propose a novel approach, TrueWalks, to incorporate negative statements
into the knowledge graph representation learning process. In particular, we
present a novel walk-generation method that is able to not only differentiate
between positive and negative statements but also take into account the
semantic implications of negation in ontology-rich knowledge graphs. This is of
particular importance for applications in the biomedical domain, where the
inadequacy of embedding approaches regarding negative statements at the
ontology level has been identified as a crucial limitation.
<br />We evaluate TrueWalks in ontology-rich biomedical knowledge graphs in two
different predictive tasks based on KG embeddings: protein-protein interaction
prediction and gene-disease association prediction. We conduct an extensive
analysis over established benchmarks and demonstrate that our method is able to
improve the performance of knowledge graph embeddings on all tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Calibration-based methods have dominated RAW image denoising under extremely
low-light environments. However, these methods suffer from several main
deficiencies: 1) the calibration procedure is laborious and time-consuming, 2)
denoisers for different cameras are difficult to transfer, and 3) the
discrepancy between synthetic noise and real noise is enlarged by high digital
gain. To overcome the above shortcomings, we propose a calibration-free
pipeline for Lighting Every Drakness (LED), regardless of the digital gain or
camera sensor. Instead of calibrating the noise parameters and training
repeatedly, our method could adapt to a target camera only with few-shot paired
data and fine-tuning. In addition, well-designed structural modification during
both stages alleviates the domain gap between synthetic and real noise without
any extra computational cost. With 2 pairs for each additional digital gain (in
total 6 pairs) and 0.5% iterations, our method achieves superior performance
over other calibration-based methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Srameo/LED .

<p class="mathjax">Given a pre-trained language model, how can we efficiently compress it
without retraining? Retraining-free structured pruning algorithms are crucial
in pre-trained language model compression due to their significantly reduced
pruning cost and capability to prune large language models. However, existing
retraining-free algorithms encounter severe accuracy degradation, as they fail
to preserve the useful knowledge of pre-trained models. In this paper, we
propose K-pruning (Knowledge-preserving pruning), an accurate retraining-free
structured pruning algorithm for pre-trained language models. K-pruning
identifies and prunes attention heads and neurons deemed to be superfluous,
based on the amount of their inherent knowledge. K-pruning applies an iterative
process of pruning followed by knowledge reconstruction for each sub-layer to
preserve the knowledge of the pre-trained models. Consequently, K-pruning shows
up to 58.02%p higher F1 score than existing retraining-free pruning algorithms
under a high compression rate of 80% on the SQuAD benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Massive emerging applications are driving demand for the ubiquitous
deployment of computing power today. This trend not only spurs the recent
popularity of the \emph{Computing and Network Convergence} (CNC), but also
introduces an urgent need for the intelligentization of a management platform
to coordinate changing resources and tasks in the CNC. Therefore, in this
article, we present the concept of an intelligence-endogenous management
platform for CNCs called \emph{CNC brain} based on artificial intelligence
technologies. It aims at efficiently and automatically matching the supply and
demand with high heterogeneity in a CNC via four key building blocks, i.e.,
perception, scheduling, adaptation, and governance, throughout the CNC's life
cycle. Their functionalities, goals, and challenges are presented. To examine
the effectiveness of the proposed concept and framework, we also implement a
prototype for the CNC brain based on a deep reinforcement learning technology.
Also, it is evaluated on a CNC testbed that integrates two open-source and
popular frameworks (OpenFaas and Kubernetes) and a real-world business dataset
provided by Microsoft Azure. The evaluation results prove the proposed method's
effectiveness in terms of resource utilization and performance. Finally, we
highlight the future research directions of the CNC brain.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning aims to learn a global model on the server side that
generalizes to all clients in a privacy-preserving manner, by leveraging the
local models from different clients. Existing solutions focus on either
regularizing the objective functions among clients or improving the aggregation
mechanism for the improved model generalization capability. However, their
performance is typically limited by the dataset biases, such as the
heterogeneous data distributions and the missing classes. To address this
issue, this paper presents a cross-silo prototypical calibration method
(FedCSPC), which takes additional prototype information from the clients to
learn a unified feature space on the server side. Specifically, FedCSPC first
employs the Data Prototypical Modeling (DPM) module to learn data patterns via
clustering to aid calibration. Subsequently, the cross-silo prototypical
calibration (CSPC) module develops an augmented contrastive learning method to
improve the robustness of the calibration, which can effectively project
cross-source features into a consistent space while maintaining clear decision
boundaries. Moreover, the CSPC module's ease of implementation and
plug-and-play characteristics make it even more remarkable. Experiments were
conducted on four datasets in terms of performance comparison, ablation study,
in-depth analysis and case study, and the results verified that FedCSPC is
capable of learning the consistent features across different data sources of
the same class under the guidance of calibrated model, which leads to better
performance than the state-of-the-art methods. The source codes have been

<p class="mathjax">This work extends the paradigm of evolutional deep neural networks (EDNNs) to
solving parametric time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) on
domains with geometric structure. By introducing positional embeddings based on
eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, geometric properties are
encoded intrinsically and Dirichlet, Neumann and periodic boundary conditions
of the PDE solution are enforced directly through the neural network
architecture. The proposed embeddings lead to improved error convergence for
static PDEs and extend EDNNs towards computational domains of realistic
complexity. Several steps are taken to improve performance of EDNNs: Solving
the EDNN update equation with a Krylov solver avoids the explicit assembly of
Jacobians and enables scaling to larger neural networks. Computational
efficiency is further improved by an ad-hoc active sampling scheme that uses
the PDE dynamics to effectively sample collocation points. A modified linearly
implicit Rosenbrock method is proposed to alleviate the time step requirements
of stiff PDEs. Lastly, a completely training-free approach, which automatically
enforces initial conditions and only requires time integration, is compared
against EDNNs that are trained on the initial conditions. We report results for
the Korteweg-de Vries equation, a nonlinear heat equation and (nonlinear)
advection-diffusion problems on domains with and without holes and various
boundary conditions, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The
numerical results highlight EDNNs as a promising surrogate model for
parametrized PDEs with slow decaying Kolmogorov n-width.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as the most powerful approach
in image synthesis. However, applying these models directly to video synthesis
presents challenges, as it often leads to noticeable flickering contents.
Although recently proposed zero-shot methods can alleviate flicker to some
extent, we still struggle to generate coherent videos. In this paper, we
propose DiffSynth, a novel approach that aims to convert image synthesis
pipelines to video synthesis pipelines. DiffSynth consists of two key
components: a latent in-iteration deflickering framework and a video
deflickering algorithm. The latent in-iteration deflickering framework applies
video deflickering to the latent space of diffusion models, effectively
preventing flicker accumulation in intermediate steps. Additionally, we propose
a video deflickering algorithm, named patch blending algorithm, that remaps
objects in different frames and blends them together to enhance video
consistency. One of the notable advantages of DiffSynth is its general
applicability to various video synthesis tasks, including text-guided video
stylization, fashion video synthesis, image-guided video stylization, video
restoring, and 3D rendering. In the task of text-guided video stylization, we
make it possible to synthesize high-quality videos without cherry-picking. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffSynth. All videos can

<p class="mathjax">The widely applied k-means algorithm produces clusterings that violate our
expectations with respect to high/low similarity/density and is in conflict
with Kleinberg's axiomatic system for distance based clustering algorithms that
formalizes those expectations in a natural way. k-means violates in particular
the consistency axiom. We hypothesise that this clash is due to the not
explicated expectation that the data themselves should have the property of
being clusterable in order to expect the algorithm clustering hem to fit a
clustering axiomatic system. To demonstrate this, we introduce two new
clusterability properties, variational k-separability and residual
k-separability and show that then the Kleinberg's consistency axiom holds for
k-means operating in the Euclidean or non-Euclidean space. Furthermore, we
propose extensions of k-means algorithm that fit approximately the Kleinberg's
richness axiom that does not hold for k-means. In this way, we reconcile
k-means with Kleinberg's axiomatic framework in Euclidean and non-Euclidean
settings. Besides contribution to the theory of axiomatic frameworks of
clustering and for clusterability theory, practical contribution is the
possibility to construct {datasets for testing purposes of algorithms
optimizing k-means cost function. This includes a method of construction of
{clusterable data with known in advance global optimum.

<p class="mathjax">Database manipulating systems (DMS) formalize operations on relational
databases like adding new tuples or deleting existing ones. To ensure
sufficient expressiveness for capturing practical database systems, DMS
operations incorporate guarding expressions first-order formulas over countable
value domains. Those features impose infinite state, infinitely branching
processes thus making automated reasoning about properties like the
reachability of states intractable. Most recent approaches, therefore, restrict
DMS to obtain decidable fragments. Nevertheless, a comprehensive semantic
framework capturing full DMS, yet incorporating effective notions of data
abstraction and process equivalence is an open issue. In this paper, we propose
DMS process semantics based on principles of abstract interpretation. The
concrete domain consists of all valid databases, whereas the abstract domain
employs different constructions for unifying sets of databases being
semantically equivalent up to particular fragments of the DMS guard language.
The connection between abstract and concrete domains is effectively established
by homomorphic mappings whose properties and restrictions depend on the
expressiveness of the DMS fragment under consideration. We instantiate our
framework for canonical DMS fragments and investigate semantical preservation
of abstractions up to bisimilarity, being one of the strongest equivalence
notions for operational process semantics.

<p class="mathjax">This research paper presents a novel approach to pothole detection using Deep
Learning and Image Processing techniques. The proposed system leverages the
VGG16 model for feature extraction and utilizes a custom Siamese network with
triplet loss, referred to as RoadScan. The system aims to address the critical
issue of potholes on roads, which pose significant risks to road users.
Accidents due to potholes on the roads have led to numerous accidents. Although
it is necessary to completely remove potholes, it is a time-consuming process.
Hence, a general road user should be able to detect potholes from a safe
distance in order to avoid damage. Existing methods for pothole detection
heavily rely on object detection algorithms which tend to have a high chance of
failure owing to the similarity in structures and textures of a road and a
pothole. Additionally, these systems utilize millions of parameters thereby
making the model difficult to use in small-scale applications for the general
citizen. By analyzing diverse image processing methods and various
high-performing networks, the proposed model achieves remarkable performance in
accurately detecting potholes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, EER,
precision, recall, and AUROC validate the effectiveness of the system.
Additionally, the proposed model demonstrates computational efficiency and
cost-effectiveness by utilizing fewer parameters and data for training. The
research highlights the importance of technology in the transportation sector
and its potential to enhance road safety and convenience. The network proposed
in this model performs with a 96.12 % accuracy, 3.89 % EER, and a 0.988 AUROC
value, which is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art works.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based models have become the mainstream approach
for recommender systems. Despite the effectiveness, they are still suffering
from the cold-start problem, i.e., recommend for few-interaction items.
Existing GNN-based recommendation models to address the cold-start problem
mainly focus on utilizing auxiliary features of users and items, leaving the
user-item interactions under-utilized. However, embeddings distributions of
cold and warm items are still largely different, since cold items' embeddings
are learned from lower-popularity interactions, while warm items' embeddings
are from higher-popularity interactions. Thus, there is a seesaw phenomenon,
where the recommendation performance for the cold and warm items cannot be
improved simultaneously. To this end, we proposed a Uncertainty-aware
Consistency learning framework for Cold-start item recommendation (shorten as
UCC) solely based on user-item interactions. Under this framework, we train the
teacher model (generator) and student model (recommender) with consistency
learning, to ensure the cold items with additionally generated low-uncertainty
interactions can have similar distribution with the warm items. Therefore, the
proposed framework improves the recommendation of cold and warm items at the
same time, without hurting any one of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both warm and cold items, with an average
performance improvement of 27.6%.

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting of renewable energy generation provides key insights which may
help with decision-making towards global decarbonisation. Renewable energy
generation can often be represented through cross-sectional hierarchies,
whereby a single farm may have multiple individual generators. Hierarchical
forecasting through reconciliation has demonstrated a significant increase in
the quality of forecasts both theoretically and empirically. However, it is not
evident whether forecasts generated by individual temporal and cross-sectional
aggregation can be superior to integrated cross-temporal forecasts and to
individual forecasts on more granular data. In this study, we investigate the
accuracies of different cross-sectional and cross-temporal reconciliation
methods using both linear regression and gradient boosting machine learning for
forecasting wind farm power generation. We found that cross-temporal
reconciliation is superior to individual cross-sectional reconciliation at
multiple temporal aggregations. Cross-temporally reconciled machine learning
base forecasts also demonstrated a high accuracy at coarser temporal
granularities, which may encourage adoption for short-term wind forecasts. We
also show that linear regression can outperform machine learning models across
most levels in cross-sectional wind time series.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) methods based on object detection enjoy
the rich knowledge of fine-grained object-text alignment but at the cost of
computationally expensive inference. Recent Visual-Transformer (ViT)-based
approaches circumvent this issue while struggling with long visual sequences
without detailed cross-modal alignment information. This paper introduces a
ViT-based VLP technique that efficiently incorporates object information
through a novel patch-text alignment mechanism. Specifically, we convert
object-level signals into patch-level ones and devise a Patch-Text Alignment
pre-training task (PTA) to learn a text-aware patch detector. By using
off-the-shelf delicate object annotations in 5\% training images, we jointly
train PTA with other conventional VLP objectives in an end-to-end manner,
bypassing the high computational cost of object detection and yielding an
effective patch detector that accurately detects text-relevant patches, thus
considerably reducing patch sequences and accelerating computation within the
ViT backbone. Our experiments on a variety of widely-used benchmarks reveal
that our method achieves a speedup of nearly 88\% compared to prior VLP models
while maintaining competitive or superior performance on downstream tasks with
similar model size and data scale.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial attacks can compromise the robustness of real-world detection
models. However, evaluating these models under real-world conditions poses
challenges due to resource-intensive experiments. Virtual simulations offer an
alternative, but the absence of standardized benchmarks hampers progress.
Addressing this, we propose an innovative instant-level data generation
pipeline using the CARLA simulator. Through this pipeline, we establish the
Discrete and Continuous Instant-level (DCI) dataset, enabling comprehensive
experiments involving three detection models and three physical adversarial
attacks. Our findings highlight diverse model performances under adversarial
conditions. Yolo v6 demonstrates remarkable resilience, experiencing just a
marginal 6.59% average drop in average precision (AP). In contrast, the ASA
attack yields a substantial 14.51% average AP reduction, twice the effect of
other algorithms. We also note that static scenes yield higher recognition AP
values, and outcomes remain relatively consistent across varying weather
conditions. Intriguingly, our study suggests that advancements in adversarial
attack algorithms may be approaching its ``limitation''.In summary, our work
underscores the significance of adversarial attacks in real-world contexts and
introduces the DCI dataset as a versatile benchmark. Our findings provide
valuable insights for enhancing the robustness of detection models and offer
guidance for future research endeavors in the realm of adversarial attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Task-based programming models have proven to be a robust and versatile way to
approach development of applications for distributed environments. They provide
natural programming patterns with high performance. However, execution on this
paradigm can be very sensitive to granularity --i.e., the quantity and
execution length of tasks. Granularity is often linked with the block size of
the data, and finding the optimal block size has several challenges, as it
requires inner knowledge of the computing environment.
<br />Our proposal is to supplement the task-based programming model with a new
mechanism --our SplIter proposal. At its core, the SplIter provides a
transparent way to split a collection into partitions (logical groups of
blocks, obtained without any transfers nor data rearrangement), which can then
be iterated. Tasks are linked to those partitions, which means that SplIter
breaks the dependency between block size and task granularity.
<br />The evaluation shows that the SplIter is able to achieve performance
improvements of over one order of magnitude when compared to the baseline, and
it is either competitive or strictly better (depending on application
characteristics) to the competitor alternative. We have chosen different
applications covering a wide variety of scenarios; those applications are
representatives of a broader set of applications and domains. The changes
required in the source code of a task-based application are minimal, preserving
the high programmability of the programming model. Two different
state-of-the-art task-based frameworks have been evaluated for all the
applications: COMPSs and Dask, showing that the SplIter can be effectively used
within different frameworks.

non-volatile memory. Of particular interest are self-implementations of key
operations, in which a recoverable operation is implemented from its
non-recoverable counterpart (in addition to reads and writes). This paper
presents two self-implementations of the SWAP operation. One works in the
system-wide failures model, where all processes fail and recover together, and
the other in the independent failures model, where each process crashes and
recovers independently of the other processes. Both algorithms are wait-free in
crash-free executions, but their recovery code is blocking. We prove that this
is inherent for the independent failures model. The impossibility result is
proved for implementations of distinguishable operations using interfering
functions, and in particular, it applies to a recoverable self-implementation

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, weakly supervised models have aided in mass detection using
mammography images, decreasing the need for pixel-level annotations. However,
most existing models in the literature rely on Class Activation Maps (CAM) as
the activation method, overlooking the potential benefits of exploring other
activation techniques. This work presents a study that explores and compares
different activation maps in conjunction with state-of-the-art methods for
weakly supervised training in mammography images. Specifically, we investigate
CAM, GradCAM, GradCAM++, XGradCAM, and LayerCAM methods within the framework of
the GMIC model for mass detection in mammography images. The evaluation is
conducted on the VinDr-Mammo dataset, utilizing the metrics Accuracy, True
Positive Rate (TPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), and False Positive Per Image
(FPPI). Results show that using different strategies of activation maps during
training and test stages leads to an improvement of the model. With this
strategy, we improve the results of the GMIC method, decreasing the FPPI value
and increasing TPR.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict students' responses to practices based
on their historical question-answering behaviors. However, most current KT
methods focus on improving overall AUC, leaving ample room for optimization in
modeling sequences of excessive or insufficient lengths. As sequences get
longer, computational costs will increase exponentially. Therefore, KT methods
usually truncate sequences to an acceptable length, which makes it difficult
for models on online service systems to capture complete historical practice
behaviors of students with too long sequences. Conversely, modeling students
with short practice sequences using most KT methods may result in overfitting
due to limited observation samples. To address the above limitations, we
propose a model called Sequence-Flexible Knowledge Tracing (SFKT).

<p class="mathjax">For a machine learning model to generalize effectively to unseen data within
a particular problem domain, it is well-understood that the data needs to be of
sufficient size and representative of real-world scenarios. Nonetheless,
real-world datasets frequently have overrepresented and underrepresented
groups. One solution to mitigate bias in machine learning is to leverage a
diverse and representative dataset. Training a model on a dataset that covers
all demographics is crucial to reducing bias in machine learning. However,
collecting and labeling large-scale datasets has been challenging, prompting
the use of synthetic data generation and active labeling to decrease the costs
of manual labeling. The focus of this study was to generate a robust face image
dataset using the StyleGAN model. In order to achieve a balanced distribution
of the dataset among different demographic groups, a synthetic dataset was
created by controlling the generation process of StyleGaN and annotated for
different downstream tasks.

<p class="mathjax">We study the convergence and error estimates of a finite volume method for
the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. Physical fluid domain is typically smooth and needs to be
approximated by a polygonal computational domain. This leads to domain-related
discretization errors, the so-called variational crimes. To treat them
efficiently we embed the fluid domain into a large enough cubed domain, and
propose a finite volume scheme for the corresponding domain-penalized problem.
Under the assumption that the numerical density and temperature are uniformly
bounded, we derive the ballistic energy inequality, yielding a priori estimates
and the consistency of the penalization finite volume approximations. Further,
we show that the numerical solutions converge weakly to a generalized, the
so-called dissipative measure-valued, solution of the corresponding Dirichlet
problem. If a strong solution exists, we prove that our numerical
approximations converge strongly with the rate 1/4. Additionally, assuming
uniform boundedness of the approximate velocities, we obtain global existence
of the strong solution. In this case we prove that the numerical solutions
converge strongly to the strong solution with the optimal rate 1/2.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding pedestrian route choice behavior in complex buildings is
important to ensure pedestrian safety. Previous studies have mostly used
traditional data collection methods and discrete choice modeling to understand
the influence of different factors on pedestrian route and exit choice,
particularly in simple indoor environments. However, research on pedestrian
route choice in complex buildings is still limited. This paper presents a
data-driven approach for understanding and predicting the pedestrian decision
point choice during normal and emergency wayfinding in a multi-story building.
For this, we first built an indoor network representation and proposed a data
mapping technique to map VR coordinates to the indoor representation. We then
used a well-established machine learning algorithm, namely the random forest
(RF) model to predict pedestrian decision point choice along a route during
four wayfinding tasks in a multi-story building. Pedestrian behavioral data in
a multi-story building was collected by a Virtual Reality experiment. The
results show a much higher prediction accuracy of decision points using the RF
model (i.e., 93% on average) compared to the logistic regression model. The
highest prediction accuracy was 96% for task 3. Additionally, we tested the
model performance combining personal characteristics and we found that personal
characteristics did not affect decision point choice. This paper demonstrates
the potential of applying a machine learning algorithm to study pedestrian
route choice behavior in complex indoor buildings.

w.r.t. an object detection paradigm and borrow from state-of-the-art detection
systems to simultaneously propose a word bounding box proposal mechanism and
compute a corresponding representation. Contrary to the norm of such methods
that rely on complex and large DNN models, we propose a novel segmentation-free
system that efficiently scans a document image to find rectangular areas that
include the query information. The underlying model is simple and compact,
predicting character occurrences over rectangular areas through an implicitly
learned scale map, trained on word-level annotated images. The proposed
document scanning is then performed using this character counting in a
cost-effective manner via integral images and binary search. Finally, the
retrieval similarity by character counting is refined by a pyramidal
representation and a CTC-based re-scoring algorithm, fully utilizing the
trained CNN model. Experimental validation on two widely-used datasets shows
that our method achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming the more

integrated sensing and communications. In this setup, each user's message is
convolved with a multi-path channel formed by several scaled and delayed copies
of Dirac spikes. The BS receives a linear combination of the convolved signals,
and the goal is to recover the unknown amplitudes, continuous-indexed delays,
and transmitted waveforms from a compressed vector of measurements at the BS.
However, in the absence of any prior knowledge of the transmitted messages and
channels, GB2D is highly challenging and intractable in general. To address
this issue, we assume that each user's message follows a distinct modulation
scheme living in a known low-dimensional subspace. By exploiting these subspace
assumptions and the sparsity of the multipath channels for different users, we
transform the nonlinear GB2D problem into a matrix tuple recovery problem from
a few linear measurements. To achieve this, we propose a semidefinite
programming optimization that exploits the specific low-dimensional structure
of the matrix tuple to recover the messages and continuous delays of different
communication paths from a single received signal at the BS. Finally, our
numerical experiments show that our proposed method effectively recovers all
transmitted messages and the continuous delay parameters of the channels with a
sufficient number of samples.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid proliferation of smart mobile devices, federated learning (FL)
has been widely considered for application in wireless networks for distributed
model training. However, data heterogeneity, e.g., non-independently
identically distributions and different sizes of training data among clients,
poses major challenges to wireless FL. Limited communication resources
complicate the implementation of fair scheduling which is required for training
on heterogeneous data, and further deteriorate the overall performance. To
address this issue, this paper focuses on performance analysis and optimization
for wireless FL, considering data heterogeneity, combined with wireless
resource allocation. Specifically, we first develop a closed-form expression
for an upper bound on the FL loss function, with a particular emphasis on data
heterogeneity described by a dataset size vector and a data divergence vector.
Then we formulate the loss function minimization problem, under constraints on
long-term energy consumption and latency, and jointly optimize client
scheduling, resource allocation, and the number of local training epochs (CRE).
Next, via the Lyapunov drift technique, we transform the CRE optimization
problem into a series of tractable problems. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other
benchmarks in terms of the learning accuracy and energy consumption.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling system-level behaviors of intricate System-on-Chip (SoC) designs is
crucial for design analysis, testing, and validation. However, the complexity
and volume of SoC traces pose significant challenges in this task. This paper
proposes an approach to automatically infer concise and abstract models from
SoC communication traces, capturing the system-level protocols that govern
message exchange and coordination between design blocks for various system
functions. This approach, referred to as model synthesis, constructs a
causality graph with annotations obtained from the SoC traces. The annotated
causality graph represents all potential causality relations among messages
under consideration. Next, a constraint satisfaction problem is formulated from
the causality graph, which is then solved by a satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT) solver to find satisfying solutions. Finally, finite state models are
extracted from the generated solutions, which can be used to explain and
understand the input traces. The proposed approach is validated through
experiments using synthetic traces obtained from simulating a transaction-level
model of a multicore SoC design and traces collected from running real programs
on a realistic multicore SoC modeled with gem5.

<p class="mathjax">The strong Byzantine agreement (SBA) problem is defined among n processes,
out of which t &lt; n can be faulty and behave arbitrarily. SBA allows correct
(non-faulty) processes to agree on a common value. Moreover, if all correct
processes have proposed the same value, only that value can be agreed upon. It
has been known for a long time that any solution to the SBA problem incurs
quadratic worst-case word complexity; additionally, the bound was known to be
tight. However, no existing protocol achieves adaptive word complexity, where
the number of exchanged words depends on the actual number of faults, and not
on the upper bound. Therefore, it is still unknown whether SBA with adaptive
word complexity exists. This paper answers the question in the affirmative.
Namely, we introduce STRONG, a synchronous protocol that solves SBA among n =
(2 + Omega(1))t + 1 processes and achieves adaptive word complexity. We show
that the fundamental challenge of adaptive SBA lies in efficiently solving
certification, the problem of obtaining a constant-sized, locally-verifiable
proof that a value can safely be decided.

environments; it is partially observable, stochastic, multi-agent, and
mastering StarCraft II requires strategic planning over long time horizons with
real-time low-level execution. It also has an active professional competitive
scene. StarCraft II is uniquely suited for advancing offline RL algorithms,
both because of its challenging nature and because Blizzard has released a
massive dataset of millions of StarCraft II games played by human players. This
paper leverages that and establishes a benchmark, called AlphaStar Unplugged,
introducing unprecedented challenges for offline reinforcement learning. We
define a dataset (a subset of Blizzard's release), tools standardizing an API
for machine learning methods, and an evaluation protocol. We also present
baseline agents, including behavior cloning, offline variants of actor-critic
and MuZero. We improve the state of the art of agents using only offline data,
and we achieve 90% win rate against previously published AlphaStar behavior
cloning agent.

<p class="mathjax">Empathy is often understood as the ability to share and understand another
individual's state of mind or emotion. With the increasing use of chatbots in
various domains, e.g., children seeking help with homework, individuals looking
for medical advice, and people using the chatbot as a daily source of everyday
companionship, the importance of empathy in human-computer interaction has
become more apparent. Therefore, our study investigates the extent to which
ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 can exhibit empathetic responses and emotional
expressions. We analyzed the following three aspects: (1) understanding and
expressing emotions, (2) parallel emotional response, and (3) empathic
personality. Thus, we not only evaluate ChatGPT on various empathy aspects and
compare it with human behavior but also show a possible way to analyze the
empathy of chatbots in general. Our results show, that in 91.7% of the cases,
ChatGPT was able to correctly identify emotions and produces appropriate
answers. In conversations, ChatGPT reacted with a parallel emotion in 70.7% of
cases. The empathic capabilities of ChatGPT were evaluated using a set of five
questionnaires covering different aspects of empathy. Even though the results
indicate that the empathic abilities of ChatGPT are still below the average of
healthy humans, the scores are better than those of people who have been
diagnosed with Asperger syndrome / high-functioning autism.

<p class="mathjax">Recent interactive segmentation methods iteratively take source image, user
guidance and previously predicted mask as the input without considering the
invariant nature of the source image. As a result, extracting features from the
source image is repeated in each interaction, resulting in substantial
computational redundancy. In this work, we propose the Feature
Decoupling-Recycling Network (FDRN), which decouples the modeling components
based on their intrinsic discrepancies and then recycles components for each
user interaction. Thus, the efficiency of the whole interactive process can be
significantly improved. To be specific, we apply the Decoupling-Recycling
strategy from three perspectives to address three types of discrepancies,
respectively. First, our model decouples the learning of source image semantics
from the encoding of user guidance to process two types of input domains
separately. Second, FDRN decouples high-level and low-level features from
stratified semantic representations to enhance feature learning. Third, during
the encoding of user guidance, current user guidance is decoupled from
historical guidance to highlight the effect of current user guidance. We
conduct extensive experiments on 6 datasets from different domains and
modalities, which demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior
efficiency than other methods, particularly advantageous in challenging
scenarios requiring long-term interactions (up to 4.25x faster), while
achieving favorable segmentation performance; 2) strong applicability to
various methods serving as a universal enhancement technique; 3) well
cross-task generalizability, e.g., to medical image segmentation, and
robustness against misleading user guidance.

<p class="mathjax">Determining and measuring diversity in news articles is important for a
number of reasons, including preventing filter bubbles and fueling public
discourse, especially before elections. So far, the identification and analysis
of diversity have been illuminated in a variety of ways, such as measuring the
overlap of words or topics between news articles related to US elections.
However, the question of how diversity in news articles can be measured
holistically, i.e., with respect to (1) variety, (2) balance, and (3)
disparity, considering individuals, parties, and topics, has not been
addressed. In this paper, we present a framework for determining diversity in
news articles according to these dimensions. Furthermore, we create and provide
a dataset of Google Top Stories, encompassing more than 26,000 unique headlines
from more than 900 news outlets collected within two weeks before and after the
2021 German federal election. While we observe high diversity for more general
search terms (e.g., "election"), a range of search terms ("education,"
"Europe," "climate protection," "government") resulted in news articles with
high diversity in two out of three dimensions. This reflects a more subjective,
dedicated discussion on rather future-oriented topics.

<p class="mathjax">To develop the most appropriate control strategy and monitor, maintain, and
evaluate the traffic performance of the freeway weaving areas, state and local
Departments of Transportation need to have access to traffic flows at each pair
of on-ramp and off-ramp. However, ramp flows are not always readily available
to transportation agencies and little effort has been made to estimate these
missing flows in locations where no physical sensors are installed. To bridge
this research gap, a data-driven framework is proposed that can accurately
estimate the missing ramp flows by solely using data collected from loop
detectors on freeway mainlines. The proposed framework employs a transfer
learning model. The transfer learning model relaxes the assumption that the
underlying data distributions of the source and target domains must be the
same. Therefore, the proposed framework can guarantee high-accuracy estimation
of on-ramp and off-ramp flows on freeways with different traffic patterns,
distributions, and characteristics. Based on the experimental results, the flow
estimation mean absolute errors range between 23.90 veh/h to 40.85 veh/h for
on-ramps, and 31.58 veh/h to 45.31 veh/h for off-ramps; the flow estimation
root mean square errors range between 34.55 veh/h to 57.77 veh/h for on-ramps,
and 41.75 veh/h to 58.80 veh/h for off-ramps. Further, the comparison analysis
shows that the proposed framework outperforms other conventional machine
learning models. The estimated ramp flows based on the proposed method can help
transportation agencies to enhance the operations of their ramp control
strategies for locations where physical sensors are not installed.

<p class="mathjax">Motion planning in dynamically changing environments is one of the most
complex challenges in autonomous driving. Safety is a crucial requirement,
along with driving comfort and speed limits. While classical sampling-based,
lattice-based, and optimization-based planning methods can generate smooth and
short paths, they often do not consider the dynamics of the environment. Some
techniques do consider it, but they rely on updating the environment on-the-go
rather than explicitly accounting for the dynamics, which is not suitable for
self-driving. To address this, we propose a novel method based on the Neural
Field Optimal Motion Planner (NFOMP), which outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of normalized curvature and the number of cusps. Our
approach embeds previously known moving obstacles into the neural field
collision model to account for the dynamics of the environment. We also
introduce time profiling of the trajectory and non-linear velocity constraints
by adding Lagrange multipliers to the trajectory loss function. We applied our

vehicle. Our evaluation shows that the maximum acceleration the passenger can
experience instantly is -7.5 m/s^2 and that 89.6% of the driving time is
devoted to normal driving with accelerations below 3.5 m/s^2. The driving style
is characterized by 46.0% and 31.4% of the driving time being devoted to the

<p class="mathjax">Transportation agencies need to assess ramp metering performance when
deploying or expanding a ramp metering system. The evaluation of a ramp
metering strategy is primarily centered around examining its impact on freeway
traffic mobility. One way these effects can be explored is by comparing traffic
states, such as the speed before and after the ramp metering strategy has been
altered. Predicting freeway traffic states for the after scenarios following
the implementation of a new ramp metering control strategy could offer valuable
insights into the potential effectiveness of the target strategy. However, the
use of machine learning methods in predicting the freeway traffic state for the
after scenarios and evaluating the effectiveness of transportation policies or
traffic control strategies such as ramp metering is somewhat limited in the
current literature. To bridge the research gap, this study presents a framework
for predicting freeway traffic parameters (speed, occupancy, and flow rate) for
the after situations when a new ramp metering control strategy is implemented.
By learning the association between the spatial-temporal features of traffic
states in before and after situations for known freeway segments, the proposed
framework can transfer this learning to predict the traffic parameters for new
freeway segments. The proposed framework is built upon a transfer learning
model. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is feasible for
use as an alternative for predicting freeway traffic parameters to proactively
evaluate ramp metering performance.

<p class="mathjax">The main source of performance degradation in cell-free massive MIMO is pilot
contamination, which causes interference during uplink training and affects
channel estimation negatively. Contamination occurs when the same pilot
sequence is assigned to more than one user. This is in general inevitable, as
the number of mutually orthogonal pilot sequences corresponds to only a
fraction of the coherence interval. We introduce an algorithm for pilot
assignment that has an approximation ratio close to 1 for a plausibly large
number of orthogonal pilot sequences. It also has low computational complexity
under massive parallelism.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
breakthroughs in understanding and responding to user intents. However, their
performance lag behind general use cases in some expertise domains, such as
Chinese medicine. Existing efforts to incorporate Chinese medicine into LLMs
rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with single-turn and distilled dialogue
data. These models lack the ability for doctor-like proactive inquiry and
multi-turn comprehension and cannot always align responses with safety and
professionalism experts. In this work, we introduce Zhongjing, the first
Chinese medical LLaMA-based LLM that implements an entire training pipeline
from pre-training to reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).
Additionally, we introduce a Chinese multi-turn medical dialogue dataset of
70,000 authentic doctor-patient dialogues, CMtMedQA, which significantly
enhances the model's capability for complex dialogue and proactive inquiry
initiation. We define a refined annotation rule and evaluation criteria given
the biomedical domain's unique characteristics. Results show that our model
outperforms baselines in various capacities and matches the performance of
ChatGPT in a few abilities, despite having 50x training data with previous best
model and 100x parameters with ChatGPT. RLHF further improves the model's
instruction-following ability and safety. We also release our code, datasets
and model for further research.

<p class="mathjax">Industry 4.0 has brought numerous advantages, such as increasing productivity
through automation. However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such
as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL)
combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection
mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single
point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be
tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized
Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource
consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting
anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series.
TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature
Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it
was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments
measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas
industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms,
and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration
utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along
with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly
detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature
engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.

<p class="mathjax">Airwriting recognition is a task that involves identifying letters written in
free space using finger movement. It is a special case of gesture recognition,
where gestures correspond to letters in a specific language.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
activity and has been widely used in brain-computer interface applications.
Leveraging EEG signals for airwriting recognition offers a promising
alternative input method for Human-Computer Interaction. One key advantage of
airwriting recognition is that users don't need to learn new gestures. By
concatenating recognized letters, a wide range of words can be formed, making
it applicable to a broader population. However, there has been limited research
in the recognition of airwriting using EEG signals, which forms the core focus
of this study. The NeuroAiR dataset comprising EEG signals recorded during
writing English uppercase alphabets is first constructed. Various features are
then explored in conjunction with different deep learning models to achieve
accurate airwriting recognition. These features include processed EEG data,
Independent Component Analysis components, source-domain-based scout time
series, and spherical and head harmonic decomposition-based features.
Furthermore, the impact of different EEG frequency bands on system performance
is comprehensively investigated. The highest accuracy achieved in this study is
44.04% using Independent Component Analysis components and the EEGNet
classification model. The results highlight the potential of EEG-based
airwriting recognition as a user-friendly modality for alternative input
methods in Human-Computer Interaction applications. This research sets a strong
baseline for future advancements and demonstrates the viability and utility of
EEG-based airwriting recognition.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates joint device identification, channel estimation, and
signal detection for LEO satellite-enabled grant-free random access, where a
multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) system with orthogonal time-frequency
space modulation (OTFS) is utilized to combat the dynamics of the
terrestrial-satellite link (TSL). We divide the receiver structure into three
modules: first, a linear module for identifying active devices, which leverages
the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm to eliminate
inter-user interference in the delay-Doppler domain; second, a non-linear
module adopting the message passing algorithm to jointly estimate channel and
detect transmit signals; the third aided by Markov random field (MRF) aims to
explore the three dimensional block sparsity of channel in the
delay-Doppler-angle domain. The soft information is exchanged iteratively
between these three modules by careful scheduling. Furthermore, the
expectation-maximization algorithm is embedded to learn the hyperparameters in
prior distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
outperforms the conventional methods significantly in terms of activity error
rate, channel estimation accuracy, and symbol error rate.

<p class="mathjax">The Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) market is rapidly expanding and
becoming more mature. For example, OpenAI's ChatGPT is an advanced large
language model (LLM) that generates responses for various queries with
associated fees. Although these models can deliver satisfactory performance,
they are far from perfect. Researchers have long studied the vulnerabilities
and limitations of LLMs, such as adversarial attacks and model toxicity.
Inevitably, commercial ML models are also not exempt from such issues, which
can be problematic as MLaaS continues to grow. In this paper, we discover a new
attack strategy against LLM APIs, namely the prompt abstraction attack.
Specifically, we propose Mondrian, a simple and straightforward method that
abstracts sentences, which can lower the cost of using LLM APIs. In this
approach, the adversary first creates a pseudo API (with a lower established
price) to serve as the proxy of the target API (with a higher established
price). Next, the pseudo API leverages Mondrian to modify the user query,
obtain the abstracted response from the target API, and forward it back to the
end user. Our results show that Mondrian successfully reduces user queries'
token length ranging from 13% to 23% across various tasks, including text
classification, generation, and question answering. Meanwhile, these abstracted
queries do not significantly affect the utility of task-specific and general
language models like ChatGPT. Mondrian also reduces instruction prompts' token
length by at least 11% without compromising output quality. As a result, the
prompt abstraction attack enables the adversary to profit without bearing the
cost of API development and deployment.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a lightning Virtual Element Method that eliminates the
stabilisation term by actually computing the virtual component of the local VEM
basis functions using a lightning approximation. In particular, the lightning
VEM approximates the virtual part of the basis functions using rational
functions with poles clustered exponentially close to the corners of each
element of the polygonal tessellation. This results in two great advantages.
First, the mathematical analysis of a priori error estimates is much easier and
essentially identical to the one for any other non-conforming Galerkin
discretisation. Second, the fact that the lightning VEM truly computes the
basis functions allows the user to access the point-wise value of the numerical
solution without needing any reconstruction techniques. The cost of the local
construction of the VEM basis is the implementation price that one has to pay
for the advantages of the lightning VEM method, but the embarrassingly
parallelizable nature of this operation will ultimately result in a
cost-efficient scheme almost comparable to standard VEM and FEM.

deriving the correlation between sentence vector and semantic meaning of a

strings into high dimensional spaces. Then we compute the pairwise distance
between any possible combination of two sentence vectors in an embedding space

correlation of distances of a sentence vector with respect to the other
sentence vectors in an embedding space. Then we compute the correlation of each

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in partially observable
contextual bandits, where agents have limited knowledge from other agents and
partial information about hidden confounders. We first convert the problem to
identifying or partially identifying causal effects between actions and rewards
through optimization problems. To solve these optimization problems, we
discretize the original functional constraints of unknown distributions into
linear constraints, and sample compatible causal models via sequentially
solving linear programmings to obtain causal bounds with the consideration of
estimation error. Our sampling algorithms provide desirable convergence results
for suitable sampling distributions. We then show how causal bounds can be
applied to improving classical bandit algorithms and affect the regrets with
respect to the size of action sets and function spaces. Notably, in the task
with function approximation which allows us to handle general context
distributions, our method improves the order dependence on function space size
compared with previous literatures. We formally prove that our causally
enhanced algorithms outperform classical bandit algorithms and achieve orders
of magnitude faster convergence rates. Finally, we perform simulations that
demonstrate the efficiency of our strategy compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods. This research has the potential to enhance the
performance of contextual bandit agents in real-world applications where data
is scarce and costly to obtain.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that allows multiple participants to
collaboratively train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) without the need of
centralizing their data. Among other advantages, it comes with
privacy-preserving properties making it attractive for application in sensitive
contexts, such as health care or the military. Although the data are not
explicitly exchanged, the training procedure requires sharing information about
participants' models. This makes the individual models vulnerable to theft or
unauthorized distribution by malicious actors. To address the issue of
ownership rights protection in the context of Machine Learning (ML), DNN
Watermarking methods have been developed during the last five years. Most
existing works have focused on watermarking in a centralized manner, but only a
few methods have been designed for FL and its unique constraints. In this
paper, we provide an overview of recent advancements in Federated Learning
watermarking, shedding light on the new challenges and opportunities that arise
in this field.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce TeraHAC, a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate hierarchical agglomerative
clustering (HAC) algorithm which scales to trillion-edge graphs. Our algorithm
is based on a new approach to computing $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC, which
is a novel combination of the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm and the notion
of $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC. Our approach allows us to partition the
graph among multiple machines and make significant progress in computing the
clustering within each partition before any communication with other partitions
is needed.
<br />We evaluate TeraHAC on a number of real-world and synthetic graphs of up to 8
trillion edges. We show that TeraHAC requires over 100x fewer rounds compared
to previously known approaches for computing HAC. It is up to 8.3x faster than
SCC, the state-of-the-art distributed algorithm for hierarchical clustering,
while achieving 1.16x higher quality. In fact, TeraHAC essentially retains the
quality of the celebrated HAC algorithm while significantly improving the
running time.

<p class="mathjax">Supervised deep learning models require significant amount of labelled data
to achieve an acceptable performance on a specific task. However, when tested
on unseen data, the models may not perform well. Therefore, the models need to
be trained with additional and varying labelled data to improve the
generalization. In this work, our goal is to understand the models, their
performance and generalization. We establish image-image, dataset-dataset, and
image-dataset distances to gain insights into the model's behavior. Our
proposed distance metric when combined with model performance can help in
selecting an appropriate model/architecture from a pool of candidate
architectures. We have shown that the generalization of these models can be
improved by only adding a small number of unseen images (say 1, 3 or 7) into
the training set. Our proposed approach reduces training and annotation costs
while providing an estimate of model performance on unseen data in dynamic
environments.

<p class="mathjax">Explainable natural language inference aims to provide a mechanism to produce
explanatory (abductive) inference chains which ground claims to their
supporting premises. A recent corpus called EntailmentBank strives to advance
this task by explaining the answer to a question using an entailment tree
\cite{dalvi2021explaining}. They employ the T5 model to directly generate the
tree, which can explain how the answer is inferred. However, it lacks the
ability to explain and control the generation of intermediate steps, which is
crucial for the multi-hop inference process. % One recent corpus,
EntailmentBank, aims to push this task forward by explaining an answer to a
question according to an entailment tree \cite{dalvi2021explaining}. They
employ T5 to generate the tree directly, which can explain how the answer is
inferred but cannot explain how the intermediate is generated, which is
essential to the multi-hop inference process. In this work, we focus on
proposing a controlled natural language inference architecture for
multi-premise explanatory inference. To improve control and enable explanatory
analysis over the generation, we define lexical inference types based on
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph and modify the architecture of T5
to learn a latent sentence representation (T5 bottleneck) conditioned on said
type information. We also deliver a dataset of approximately 5000 annotated
explanatory inference steps, with well-grounded lexical-symbolic operations.
Experimental results indicate that the inference typing induced at the T5
bottleneck can help T5 to generate a conclusion under explicit control.

<p class="mathjax">A fundamental challenge in the current NLP context, dominated by language
models, comes from the inflexibility of current architectures to 'learn' new
information. While model-centric solutions like continual learning or
parameter-efficient fine tuning are available, the question still remains of
how to reliably identify changes in language or in the world. In this paper, we
propose WikiTiDe, a dataset derived from pairs of timestamped definitions
extracted from Wikipedia. We argue that such resource can be helpful for
accelerating diachronic NLP, specifically, for training models able to scan
knowledge resources for core updates concerning a concept, an event, or a named
entity. Our proposed end-to-end method is fully automatic, and leverages a
bootstrapping algorithm for gradually creating a high-quality dataset. Our
results suggest that bootstrapping the seed version of WikiTiDe leads to better
fine-tuned models. We also leverage fine-tuned models in a number of downstream
tasks, showing promising results with respect to competitive baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Modern applications commonly need to manage dataset types composed of
heterogeneous data and schemas, making it difficult to access them in an
integrated way. A single data store to manage heterogeneous data using a common
data model is not effective in such a scenario, which results in the domain
data being fragmented in the data stores that best fit their storage and access
requirements (e.g., NoSQL, relational DBMS, or HDFS). Besides, organization
workflows independently consume these fragments, and usually, there is no
explicit link among the fragments that would be useful to support an integrated
view. The research challenge tackled by this work is to provide the means to
query heterogeneous data residing on distinct data repositories that are not
explicitly connected. We propose a federated database architecture by providing
a single abstract global conceptual schema to users, allowing them to write
their queries, encapsulating data heterogeneity, location, and linkage by
employing: (i) meta-models to represent the global conceptual schema, the
remote data local conceptual schemas, and mappings among them; (ii) provenance
to create explicit links among the consumed and generated data residing in
separate datasets. We evaluated the architecture through its implementation as
a polystore service, following a microservice architecture approach, in a
scenario that simulates a real case in Oil \&amp; Gas industry. Also, we compared
the proposed architecture to a relational multidatabase system based on foreign
data wrappers, measuring the user's cognitive load to write a query (or query
complexity) and the query processing time. The results demonstrated that the
proposed architecture allows query writing two times less complex than the one
written for the relational multidatabase system, adding an excess of no more
than 30% in query processing time.

<p class="mathjax">Digital soil mapping (DSM) is an advanced approach that integrates
statistical modeling and cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning
(ML) methods, to accurately depict soil properties and their spatial
distribution. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a crucial soil attribute providing
valuable insights into soil health, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions,
and overall ecosystem productivity. This study highlights the significance of
spatial-temporal deep learning (DL) techniques within the DSM framework. A
novel architecture is proposed, incorporating spatial information using a base
convolutional neural network (CNN) model and spatial attention mechanism, along
with climate temporal information using a long short-term memory (LSTM)
network, for SOC prediction across Europe. The model utilizes a comprehensive
set of environmental features, including Landsat-8 images, topography, remote
sensing indices, and climate time series, as input features. Results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional ML approaches
like random forest commonly used in DSM, yielding lower root mean square error
(RMSE). This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and could be applied to
other soil properties, thereby contributing to the advancement of DSM
techniques and facilitating land management and decision-making processes based
on accurate information.

<p class="mathjax">Multimedia recommendation has received much attention in recent years. It
models user preferences based on both behavior information and item multimodal
information. Though current GCN-based methods achieve notable success, they
suffer from two limitations: (1) Modality noise contamination to the item
representations. Existing methods often mix modality features and behavior
features in a single view (e.g., user-item view) for propagation, the noise in
the modality features may be amplified and coupled with behavior features. In
the end, it leads to poor feature discriminability; (2) Incomplete user
preference modeling caused by equal treatment of modality features. Users often
exhibit distinct modality preferences when purchasing different items. Equally
fusing each modality feature ignores the relative importance among different
modalities, leading to the suboptimal user preference modeling. To tackle the
above issues, we propose a novel Multi-View Graph Convolutional Network for the
multimedia recommendation. Specifically, to avoid modality noise contamination,
the modality features are first purified with the aid of item behavior
information. Then, the purified modality features of items and behavior
features are enriched in separate views, including the user-item view and the
item-item view. In this way, the distinguishability of features is enhanced.
Meanwhile, a behavior-aware fuser is designed to comprehensively model user
preferences by adaptively learning the relative importance of different
modality features. Furthermore, we equip the fuser with a self-supervised
auxiliary task. This task is expected to maximize the mutual information
between the fused multimodal features and behavior features, so as to capture
complementary and supplementary preference information simultaneously.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our methods.

<p class="mathjax">When used in the context of decision theory, feature importance expresses how
much changing the value of a feature can change the model outcome (or the
utility of the outcome), compared to other features. Feature importance should
not be confused with the feature influence used by most state-of-the-art
post-hoc Explainable AI methods. Contrary to feature importance, feature
influence is measured against a reference level or baseline. The Contextual
Importance and Utility (CIU) method provides a unified definition of global and
local feature importance that is applicable also for post-hoc explanations,
where the value utility concept provides instance-level assessment of how
favorable or not a feature value is for the outcome. The paper shows how CIU
can be applied to both global and local explainability, assesses the fidelity
and stability of different methods, and shows how explanations that use
contextual importance and contextual utility can provide more expressive and
flexible explanations than when using influence only.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting useful visual cues for the downstream tasks is especially
challenging under low-light vision. Prior works create enhanced representations
by either correlating visual quality with machine perception or designing
illumination-degrading transformation methods that require pre-training on
synthetic datasets. We argue that optimizing enhanced image representation
pertaining to the loss of the downstream task can result in more expressive
representations. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel module,
FeatEnHancer, that hierarchically combines multiscale features using
multiheaded attention guided by task-related loss function to create suitable
representations. Furthermore, our intra-scale enhancement improves the quality
of features extracted at each scale or level, as well as combines features from
different scales in a way that reflects their relative importance for the task
at hand. FeatEnHancer is a general-purpose plug-and-play module and can be
incorporated into any low-light vision pipeline. We show with extensive
experimentation that the enhanced representation produced with FeatEnHancer
significantly and consistently improves results in several low-light vision
tasks, including dark object detection (+5.7 mAP on ExDark), face detection
(+1.5 mAPon DARK FACE), nighttime semantic segmentation (+5.1 mIoU on ACDC ),
and video object detection (+1.8 mAP on DarkVision), highlighting the
effectiveness of enhancing hierarchical features under low-light vision.

<p class="mathjax">The original vision of AI was re-articulated in 2002 via the term 'Artificial
General Intelligence' or AGI. This vision is to build 'Thinking Machines' -
computer systems that can learn, reason, and solve problems similar to the way
humans do. This is in stark contrast to the 'Narrow AI' approach practiced by
almost everyone in the field over the many decades. While several large-scale
efforts have nominally been working on AGI (most notably DeepMind), the field
of pure focused AGI development has not been well funded or promoted. This is
surprising given the fantastic value that true AGI can bestow on humanity. In
addition to the dearth of effort in this field, there are also several
theoretical and methodical missteps that are hampering progress. We highlight
why purely statistical approaches are unlikely to lead to AGI, and identify
several crucial cognitive abilities required to achieve human-like adaptability
and autonomous learning. We conclude with a survey of socio-technical factors
that have undoubtedly slowed progress towards AGI.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores negative lexical constraining in English to Czech neural
machine translation. Negative lexical constraining is used to prohibit certain
words or expressions in the translation produced by the neural translation
model. We compared various methods based on modifying either the decoding
process or the training data. The comparison was performed on two tasks:
paraphrasing and feedback-based translation refinement. We also studied to
which extent these methods "evade" the constraints presented to the model
(usually in the dictionary form) by generating a different surface form of a
given constraint.We propose a way to mitigate the issue through training with
stemmed negative constraints to counter the model's ability to induce a variety
of the surface forms of a word that can result in bypassing the constraint. We
demonstrate that our method improves the constraining, although the problem
still persists in many cases.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised video denoising has seen decent progress through the use of
blind spot networks. However, under their blind spot constraints, previous
self-supervised video denoising methods suffer from significant information
loss and texture destruction in either the whole reference frame or neighbor
frames, due to their inadequate consideration of the receptive field. Moreover,
the limited number of available neighbor frames in previous methods leads to
the discarding of distant temporal information. Nonetheless, simply adopting
existing recurrent frameworks does not work, since they easily break the
constraints on the receptive field imposed by self-supervision. In this paper,
we propose RDRF for self-supervised video denoising, which not only fully
exploits both the reference and neighbor frames with a denser receptive field,
but also better leverages the temporal information from both local and distant
neighbor features. First, towards a comprehensive utilization of information
from both reference and neighbor frames, RDRF realizes a denser receptive field
by taking more neighbor pixels along the spatial and temporal dimensions.
Second, it features a self-supervised recurrent video denoising framework,
which concurrently integrates distant and near-neighbor temporal features. This
enables long-term bidirectional information aggregation, while mitigating error
accumulation in the plain recurrent framework. Our method exhibits superior
performance on both synthetic and real video denoising datasets. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/Wang-XIaoDingdd/RDRF.

<p class="mathjax">Creating expressive, diverse and high-quality 3D avatars from highly
customized text descriptions and pose guidance is a challenging task, due to
the intricacy of modeling and texturing in 3D that ensure details and various
styles (realistic, fictional, etc). We present AvatarVerse, a stable pipeline
for generating expressive high-quality 3D avatars from nothing but text
descriptions and pose guidance. In specific, we introduce a 2D diffusion model
conditioned on DensePose signal to establish 3D pose control of avatars through
2D images, which enhances view consistency from partially observed scenarios.
It addresses the infamous Janus Problem and significantly stablizes the
generation process. Moreover, we propose a progressive high-resolution 3D
synthesis strategy, which obtains substantial improvement over the quality of
the created 3D avatars. To this end, the proposed AvatarVerse pipeline achieves
zero-shot 3D modeling of 3D avatars that are not only more expressive, but also
in higher quality and fidelity than previous works. Rigorous qualitative
evaluations and user studies showcase AvatarVerse's superiority in synthesizing
high-fidelity 3D avatars, leading to a new standard in high-quality and stable
3D avatar creation. Our project page is: https://avatarverse3d.github.io

<p class="mathjax">Capacity expansion models for the electric power system often employ zonal
(rather than nodal) resolution, necessitating estimates of aggregate power
transfer limits across the interfaces between model zones. Interface limits
between planning areas are sometimes published, but they are not generalizable
to arbitrary zone shapes. There is thus a need for a reproducible method for
estimating interface transfer limits (ITLs) between user-defined zones directly
from nodal transmission system data. Here, we present a simple method for
estimating ITLs using a DC power flow approximation via the power transfer
distribution factor (PTDF) matrix. Linear optimization is performed to identify
the distribution of power flows that maximizes the total flow on
interface-crossing lines, subject to individual line ratings, limits on bus
injection/withdrawal, and the relationships among flows, injections, and
withdrawals imposed by the PTDF matrix. We demonstrate the application of the
method on a 134-zone ~65000-bus system, and we explore the influence of flow
direction, contingency level, and zone size on the estimated ITLs. There is
significant heterogeneity in the ratio of the ITL to the sum of
interface-crossing line ratings, which highlights the importance of accounting
for the physical constraints on power flows imposed by Kirchhoff's laws when
estimating zonal ITLs.

<p class="mathjax">We propose Dirigo, a distributed stream processing service built atop virtual
actors. Dirigo achieves both a high level of resource efficiency and
performance isolation driven by user intent (SLO). To improve resource
efficiency, Dirigo adopts a serverless architecture that enables time-sharing
of compute resources among streaming operators, both within and across
applications. Meanwhile, Dirigo improves performance isolation by inheriting
the property of function autoscaling from serverless architecture.
Specifically, Dirigo proposes (i) dual-mode actor, an actor abstraction that
dynamically provides orderliness guarantee for streaming operator during
autoscaling and (ii) a data plane scheduling mechanism, along with its API,
that allows scheduling and scaling at the message-level granularity.

<p class="mathjax">We propose three novel spatial data selection techniques for particle data in
VR visualization environments. They are designed to be target- and
context-aware and be suitable for a wide range of data features and complex
scenarios. Each technique is designed to be adjusted to particular selection
intents: the selection of consecutive dense regions, the selection of
filament-like structures, and the selection of clusters -- with all of them
facilitating post-selection threshold adjustment. These techniques allow users
to precisely select those regions of space for further exploration -- with
simple and approximate 3D pointing, brushing, or drawing input -- using
flexible point- or path-based input and without being limited by 3D occlusions,
non-homogeneous feature density, or complex data shapes. These new techniques
are evaluated in a controlled experiment and compared with the Baseline method,
a region-based 3D painting selection. Our results indicate that our techniques
are effective in handling a wide range of scenarios and allow users to select
data based on their comprehension of crucial features. Furthermore, we analyze
the attributes, requirements, and strategies of our spatial selection methods
and compare them with existing state-of-the-art selection methods to handle
diverse data features and situations. Based on this analysis we provide
guidelines for choosing the most suitable 3D spatial selection techniques based
on the interaction environment, the given data characteristics, or the need for
interactive post-selection threshold adjustment.

<p class="mathjax">Visual pre-training with large-scale real-world data has made great progress
in recent years, showing great potential in robot learning with pixel
observations. However, the recipes of visual pre-training for robot
manipulation tasks are yet to be built. In this paper, we thoroughly
investigate the effects of visual pre-training strategies on robot manipulation
tasks from three fundamental perspectives: pre-training datasets, model
architectures and training methods. Several significant experimental findings
are provided that are beneficial for robot learning. Further, we propose a
visual pre-training scheme for robot manipulation termed Vi-PRoM, which
combines self-supervised learning and supervised learning. Concretely, the
former employs contrastive learning to acquire underlying patterns from
large-scale unlabeled data, while the latter aims learning visual semantics and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on robot manipulations in various
simulation environments and the real robot demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed scheme. Videos and more details can be found on

<p class="mathjax">Data compression algorithms typically rely on identifying repeated sequences
of symbols from the original data to provide a compact representation of the
same information, while maintaining the ability to recover the original data
from the compressed sequence. Using data transformations prior to the
compression process has the potential to enhance the compression capabilities,
being lossless as long as the transformation is invertible. Floating point data
presents unique challenges to generate invertible transformations with high
compression potential. This paper identifies key conditions for basic
operations of floating point data that guarantee lossless transformations.
Then, we show four methods that make use of these observations to deliver
lossless compression of real datasets, where we improve compression rates up to

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a novel method for mobile manipulators to perform
multiple contact-rich manipulation tasks. While learning-based methods have the
potential to generate actions in an end-to-end manner, they often suffer from
insufficient action accuracy and robustness against noise. On the other hand,
classical control-based methods can enhance system robustness, but at the cost
of extensive parameter tuning. To address these challenges, we present
MOMA-Force, a visual-force imitation method that seamlessly combines
representation learning for perception, imitation learning for complex motion
generation, and admittance whole-body control for system robustness and
controllability. MOMA-Force enables a mobile manipulator to learn multiple
complex contact-rich tasks with high success rates and small contact forces. In
a real household setting, our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of
task success rates. Moreover, our method achieves smaller contact forces and
smaller force variances compared to baseline methods without force imitation.
Overall, we offer a promising approach for efficient and robust mobile
manipulation in the real world. Videos and more details can be found on

<p class="mathjax">Hyperproperties are properties that relate multiple execution traces.
Previous work on monitoring hyperproperties focused on synchronous
hyperproperties, usually specified in HyperLTL. When monitoring synchronous
hyperproperties, all traces are assumed to proceed at the same speed. We
introduce (multi-trace) prefix transducers and show how to use them for
monitoring synchronous as well as, for the first time, asynchronous
hyperproperties. Prefix transducers map multiple input traces into one or more
output traces, by incrementally matching prefixes of the input traces against
expressions similar to regular expressions. The prefixes of different traces
which are consumed by a single matching step of the monitor may have different
lengths. The deterministic and executable nature of prefix transducers makes
them more suitable as an intermediate formalism for runtime verification than
logical specifications, which tend to be highly nondeterministic, especially in
the case of asynchronous hyperproperties. We report on a set of experiments
about monitoring asynchronous version of observational determinism.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic medication mining from clinical and biomedical text has become a
popular topic due to its real impact on healthcare applications and the recent
development of powerful language models (LMs). However, fully-automatic
extraction models still face obstacles to be overcome such that they can be
deployed directly into clinical practice for better impacts. Such obstacles
include their imbalanced performances on different entity types and clinical
events. In this work, we examine current state-of-the-art pre-trained language
models (PLMs) on such tasks, via fine-tuning including the monolingual model
Med7 and multilingual large language model (LLM) XLM-RoBERTa. We compare their
advantages and drawbacks using historical medication mining shared task data
sets from n2c2-2018 challenges. We report the findings we get from these
fine-tuning experiments such that they can facilitate future research on
addressing them, for instance, how to combine their outputs, merge such models,
or improve their overall accuracy by ensemble learning and data augmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Retrofitting and thermographic survey (TS) companies in Scotland collaborate
with social housing providers to tackle fuel poverty. They employ ground-level
infrared (IR) camera-based-TSs (GIRTSs) for collecting thermal images to
identi-fy the heat loss sources resulting from poor insulation. However, this
identifica-tion process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, necessitating
extensive data processing. To automate this, an AI-driven approach is
necessary. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning (DL)-based
segmentation framework using the Mask Region Proposal Convolutional Neural
Network (Mask RCNN) to validate its applicability to these thermal images. The
objective of the framework is to au-tomatically identify, and crop heat loss
sources caused by weak insulation, while also eliminating obstructive objects
present in those images. By doing so, it min-imizes labor-intensive tasks and
provides an automated, consistent, and reliable solution. To validate the
proposed framework, approximately 2500 thermal imag-es were collected in
collaboration with industrial TS partner. Then, 1800 repre-sentative images
were carefully selected with the assistance of experts and anno-tated to
highlight the target objects (TO) to form the final dataset. Subsequently, a
transfer learning strategy was employed to train the dataset, progressively
aug-menting the training data volume and fine-tuning the pre-trained baseline
Mask RCNN. As a result, the final fine-tuned model achieved a mean average
precision (mAP) score of 77.2% for segmenting the TO, demonstrating the
significant po-tential of proposed framework in accurately quantifying energy
loss in Scottish homes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a machine learning approach for tuning the parameters of
a family of stabilizing controllers for orbital tracking. An augmented random
search algorithm is deployed, which aims at minimizing a cost function
combining convergence time and fuel consumption. The main feature of the
proposed learning strategy is that closed-loop stability is always guaranteed
during the exploration of the parameter space, {a property that allows one to
streamline the training process by restricting the search domain to
well-behaved control policies.} The proposed approach is tested on two case
studies: an orbital transfer and a rendezvous and docking mission. It is shown
that in both cases the learned control parameters lead to a significant
improvement of the considered performance measure.

<p class="mathjax">In the last decades, the necessity to process massive amounts of textual data
fueled the development of compressed text indexes: data structures efficiently
answering queries on a given text while occupying space proportional to the
compressed representation of the text. A widespread phenomenon in compressed
indexing is that more powerful queries require larger indexes. For example,
random access, the most basic query, can be supported in
$O(\delta\log\frac{n\log\sigma}{\delta\log n})$ space (where $n$ is the text
length, $\sigma$ is the alphabet size, and $\delta$ is text's substring
complexity), which is the asymptotically smallest space to represent a string,
for all $n$, $\sigma$, and $\delta$ (Kociumaka, Navarro, Prezza; IEEE Trans.
Inf. Theory 2023). The other end of the hierarchy is occupied by indexes
supporting the powerful suffix array (SA) queries. The currently smallest one
takes $O(r\log\frac{n}{r})$ space, where $r\geq\delta$ is the number of runs in
the BWT of the text (Gagie, Navarro, Prezza; J. ACM 2020).
<br />We present a new compressed index that needs only
$O(\delta\log\frac{n\log\sigma}{\delta\log n})$ space to support SA
functionality in $O(\log^{4+\epsilon} n)$ time. This collapses the hierarchy of
compressed data structures into a single point: The space required to represent
the text is simultaneously sufficient for efficient SA queries. Our result
immediately improves the space complexity of dozens of algorithms, which can
now be executed in optimal compressed space.
<br />In addition, we show how to construct our index in $O(\delta\text{ polylog }
n)$ time from the LZ77 parsing of the text. For highly repetitive texts, this
is up to exponentially faster than the previously best algorithm. To obtain our
results, we develop numerous techniques of independent interest, including the
first $O(\delta\log\frac{n\log\sigma}{\delta\log n})$-size index for LCE
queries.

<p class="mathjax">Random walks find extensive application across various complex network
domains, including embedding generation and link prediction. Despite the
widespread utilization of random walks, the precise impact of distinct biases
on embedding generation from sequence data and their subsequent effects on link
prediction remain elusive. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of
several random walk strategies, each rooted in different biases: true
self-avoidance, unbiased randomness, bias towards node degree, and inverse node
degree bias. Furthermore, we explore diverse adaptations of the node2vec
algorithm to induce distinct exploratory behaviors. Our empirical findings
demonstrate that despite the varied behaviors inherent in these embeddings,
only slight performance differences manifest in the context of link prediction.
This implies the resilient recovery of network structure, regardless of the
specific walk heuristic employed to traverse the network. Consequently, the
results suggest that data generated from sequences governed by unknown
mechanisms can be successfully reconstructed.

<p class="mathjax">The adaptive immune system's T and B cells can be viewed as large populations
of simple, diverse classifiers. Artificial immune systems (AIS)
$\unicode{x2013}$ algorithmic models of T or B cell repertoires
$\unicode{x2013}$ are used in both computational biology and natural computing
to investigate how the immune system adapts to its changing environments.
However, researchers have struggled to build such systems at scale. For
string-based AISs, finite state machines (FSMs) can store cell repertoires in
compressed representations that are orders of magnitude smaller than explicitly
stored receptor sets. This strategy allows AISs with billions of receptors to
be generated in a matter of seconds. However, to date, these FSM-based AISs
have been unable to deal with multiplicity in input data. Here, we show how
weighted FSMs can be used to represent cell repertoires and model immunological
processes like negative and positive selection, while also taking into account
the multiplicity of input data. We use our method to build simple
immune-inspired classifier systems that solve various toy problems in anomaly
detection, showing how weights can be crucial for both performance and
robustness to parameters. Our approach can potentially be extended to increase
the scale of other population-based machine learning algorithms such as
learning classifier systems.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a
wide range of natural language tasks. However, as these models continue to grow
in size, they face significant challenges in terms of computational costs.
Additionally, LLMs often lack efficient domain-specific understanding, which is
particularly crucial in specialized fields such as aviation and healthcare. To
boost the domain-specific understanding, we propose, KITLM, a novel knowledge
base integration approach into language model through relevant information
infusion. By integrating pertinent knowledge, not only the performance of the
language model is greatly enhanced, but the model size requirement is also
significantly reduced while achieving comparable performance. Our proposed
knowledge-infused model surpasses the performance of both GPT-3.5-turbo and the
state-of-the-art knowledge infusion method, SKILL, achieving over 1.5 times
improvement in exact match scores on the MetaQA. KITLM showed a similar
performance boost in the aviation domain with AeroQA. The drastic performance
improvement of KITLM over the existing methods can be attributed to the
infusion of relevant knowledge while mitigating noise. In addition, we release
two curated datasets to accelerate knowledge infusion research in specialized
fields: a) AeroQA, a new benchmark dataset designed for multi-hop
question-answering within the aviation domain, and b) Aviation Corpus, a
dataset constructed from unstructured text extracted from the National
Transportation Safety Board reports. Our research contributes to advancing the
field of domain-specific language understanding and showcases the potential of
knowledge infusion techniques in improving the performance of language models
on question-answering.

<p class="mathjax">Contemporary real-time video communication systems, such as WebRTC, use an
adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm to assure high-quality and low-delay services,
e.g., promptly adjusting video bitrate according to the instantaneous network
bandwidth. However, target bitrate decisions in the network and bitrate control
in the codec are typically incoordinated and simply ignoring the effect of
inappropriate resolution and frame rate settings also leads to compromised
results in bitrate control, thus devastatingly deteriorating the quality of
experience (QoE). To tackle these challenges, Mamba, an end-to-end
multi-dimensional ABR algorithm is proposed, which utilizes multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) to maximize the user's QoE by adaptively and
collaboratively adjusting encoding factors including the quantization
parameters (QP), resolution, and frame rate based on observed states such as
network conditions and video complexity information in a video conferencing
system. We also introduce curriculum learning to improve the training
efficiency of MARL. Both the in-lab and real-world evaluation results
demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of Mamba.

<p class="mathjax">Illustrative textures, such as stippling or hatching, were predominantly used
as an alternative to conventional Phong rendering. Recently, the potential of
encoding information on surfaces or maps using different densities has also
been recognized. This has the significant advantage that additional color can
be used as another visual channel and the illustrative textures can then be
overlaid. Effectively, it is thus possible to display multiple information,
such as two different scalar fields on surfaces simultaneously. In previous
work, these textures were manually generated and the choice of density was
unempirically determined. Here, we first want to determine and understand the
perceptual space of illustrative textures. We chose a succession of simplices
with increasing dimensions as primitives for our textures: Dots, lines, and
triangles. Thus, we explore the texture types of stippling, hatching, and
triangles. We create a range of textures by sampling the density space
uniformly. Then, we conduct three perceptual studies in which the participants
performed pairwise comparisons for each texture type. We use multidimensional
scaling (MDS) to analyze the perceptual spaces per category. The perception of
stippling and triangles seems relatively similar. Both are adequately described
by a 1D manifold in 2D space. The perceptual space of hatching consists of two
main clusters: Crosshatched textures, and textures with only one hatching
direction. However, the perception of hatching textures with only one hatching
direction is similar to the perception of stippling and triangles. Based on our
findings, we construct perceptually uniform illustrative textures. Afterwards,
we provide concrete application examples for the constructed textures.

<p class="mathjax">Tabular data represents one of the most prevalent form of data. When it comes
to data generation, many approaches would learn a density for the data
generation process, but would not necessarily end up with a sampler, even less
so being exact with respect to the underlying density. A second issue is on
models: while complex modeling based on neural nets thrives in image or text
generation (etc.), less is known for powerful generative models on tabular
data. A third problem is the visible chasm on tabular data between training
algorithms for supervised learning with remarkable properties (e.g. boosting),
and a comparative lack of guarantees when it comes to data generation. In this
paper, we tackle the three problems, introducing new tree-based generative
models convenient for density modeling and tabular data generation that improve
on modeling capabilities of recent proposals, and a training algorithm which
simplifies the training setting of previous approaches and displays
boosting-compliant convergence. This algorithm has the convenient property to
rely on a supervised training scheme that can be implemented by a few tweaks to
the most popular induction scheme for decision tree induction with two classes.
Experiments are provided on missing data imputation and comparing generated
data to real data, displaying the quality of the results obtained by our
approach, in particular against state of the art.

<p class="mathjax">Grid visualizations are widely used in many applications to visually explain
a set of data and their proximity relationships. However, existing layout
methods face difficulties when dealing with the inherent cluster structures
within the data. To address this issue, we propose a cluster-aware grid layout
method that aims to better preserve cluster structures by simultaneously
considering proximity, compactness, and convexity in the optimization process.
Our method utilizes a hybrid optimization strategy that consists of two phases.
The global phase aims to balance proximity and compactness within each cluster,
while the local phase ensures the convexity of cluster shapes. We evaluate the
proposed grid layout method through a series of quantitative experiments and
two use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving cluster structures
and facilitating analysis tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate catheter tracking is crucial during minimally invasive endovascular
procedures (MIEP), and electromagnetic (EM) tracking is a widely used
technology that serves this purpose. However, registration between preoperative
images and the EM tracking system is often challenging. Existing registration
methods typically require manual interactions, which can be time-consuming,
increase the risk of errors and change the procedural workflow. Although
several registration methods are available for catheter tracking, such as
marker-based and path-based approaches, their limitations can impact the
accuracy of the resulting tracking solution, consequently, the outcome of the
medical procedure.
<br />This paper introduces a novel automated catheter registration method for
EM-guided MIEP. The method utilizes 3D signal temporal analysis, such as
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms, to improve registration accuracy and
reliability compared to existing methods. DTW can accurately warp and match
EM-tracked paths to the vessel's centerline, making it particularly suitable
for registration. The introduced registration method is evaluated for accuracy
in a vascular phantom using a marker-based registration as the ground truth.
The results indicate that the DTW method yields accurate and reliable
registration outcomes, with a mean error of $2.22$mm. The introduced
registration method presents several advantages over state-of-the-art methods,
such as high registration accuracy, no initialization required, and increased
automation.

<p class="mathjax">Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a technique for reconstructing the
3-dimensional (3D) structure of biomolecules (especially large protein
complexes and molecular assemblies). As the resolution increases to the
near-atomic scale, building protein structures de novo from cryo-EM maps
becomes possible. Recently, recognition-based de novo building methods have
shown the potential to streamline this process. However, it cannot build a
complete structure due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem. At the
same time, AlphaFold has led to a great breakthrough in predicting protein
structures. This has inspired us to combine fragment recognition and structure
prediction methods to build a complete structure. In this paper, we propose a
new method named FFF that bridges protein structure prediction and protein
structure recognition with flexible fitting. First, a multi-level recognition
network is used to capture various structural features from the input 3D
cryo-EM map. Next, protein structural fragments are generated using pseudo
peptide vectors and a protein sequence alignment method based on these
extracted features. Finally, a complete structural model is constructed using
the predicted protein fragments via flexible fitting. Based on our benchmark
tests, FFF outperforms the baseline methods for building complete protein
structures.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the community has witnessed the advancement of Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have shown remarkable performance on various downstream
tasks. Led by powerful models like ChatGPT and Claude, LLMs are revolutionizing
how users engage with software, assuming more than mere tools but intelligent
assistants. Consequently, evaluating LLMs' anthropomorphic capabilities becomes
increasingly important in contemporary discourse. Utilizing the emotion
appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of
LLMs, i.e., how their feelings change when presented with specific situations.
After a careful and comprehensive survey, we collect a dataset containing over
400 situations that have proven effective in eliciting the eight emotions
central to our study. Categorizing the situations into 36 factors, we conduct a
human evaluation involving more than 1,200 subjects worldwide. With the human
evaluation results as references, our evaluation includes five LLMs, covering
both commercial and open-source models, including variations in model sizes,
featuring the latest iterations, such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 2. A conclusion can be
drawn from the results that, despite several misalignments, LLMs can generally
respond appropriately to certain situations. Nevertheless, they fall short in
alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings and cannot establish
connections between similar situations. Our collected dataset of situations,
the human evaluation results, and the code of our testing framework, dubbed
EmotionBench, is made publicly in https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/EmotionBench.
We aspire to contribute to the advancement of LLMs regarding better alignment
with the emotional behaviors of human beings, thereby enhancing their utility
and applicability as intelligent assistants.

<p class="mathjax">Digital computers have been getting exponentially faster for decades, but
huge challenges exist today. Transistor scaling, described by Moore's law, has
been slowing down over the last few years, ending the era of fully predictable
performance improvements. Furthermore, the data-centric computing demands
fueled by machine learning applications are rapidly growing, and current
computing systems -- even with the historical rate of improvements driven by
Moore's law -- cannot keep up with these enormous computational demands. Some
are turning to analogue in-memory computing as a solution, where specialised
systems operating on physical principles accelerate specific tasks. We explore
how emerging nonvolatile memories can be used to implement such systems
tailored for machine learning. In particular, we discuss how memristive
crossbar arrays can accelerate key linear algebra operations used in neural
networks, what technological challenges remain, and how they can be overcome.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer architectures and models have made significant progress in
language-based tasks. In this area, is BERT one of the most widely used and
freely available transformer architecture. In our work, we use BERT for
context-based phrase recognition of magic spells in the Harry Potter novel
series. Spells are a common part of active magic in fantasy novels. Typically,
spells are used in a specific context to achieve a supernatural effect. A
series of investigations were conducted to see if a Transformer architecture
could recognize such phrases based on their context in the Harry Potter saga.
For our studies a pre-trained BERT model was used and fine-tuned utilising
different datasets and training methods to identify the searched context. By
considering different approaches for sequence classification as well as token
classification, it is shown that the context of spells can be recognised.
According to our investigations, the examined sequence length for fine-tuning
and validation of the model plays a significant role in context recognition.
Based on this, we have investigated whether spells have overarching properties
that allow a transfer of the neural network models to other fantasy universes
as well. The application of our model showed promising results and is worth to
be deepened in subsequent studies.

<p class="mathjax">We give a new framework for solving the fundamental problem of low-rank
matrix completion, i.e., approximating a rank-$r$ matrix $\mathbf{M} \in
\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ (where $m \ge n$) from random observations. First, we
provide an algorithm which completes $\mathbf{M}$ on $99\%$ of rows and columns
under no further assumptions on $\mathbf{M}$ from $\approx mr$ samples and
using $\approx mr^2$ time. Then, assuming the row and column spans of
$\mathbf{M}$ satisfy additional regularity properties, we show how to boost
this partial completion guarantee to a full matrix completion algorithm by
aggregating solutions to regression problems involving the observations.
<br />In the well-studied setting where $\mathbf{M}$ has incoherent row and column
spans, our algorithms complete $\mathbf{M}$ to high precision from
$mr^{2+o(1)}$ observations in $mr^{3 + o(1)}$ time (omitting logarithmic
factors in problem parameters), improving upon the prior state-of-the-art
[JN15] which used $\approx mr^5$ samples and $\approx mr^7$ time. Under an
assumption on the row and column spans of $\mathbf{M}$ we introduce (which is
satisfied by random subspaces with high probability), our sample complexity
improves to an almost information-theoretically optimal $mr^{1 + o(1)}$, and
our runtime improves to $mr^{2 + o(1)}$. Our runtimes have the appealing
property of matching the best known runtime to verify that a rank-$r$
decomposition $\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^\top$ agrees with the sampled observations.
We also provide robust variants of our algorithms that, given random
observations from $\mathbf{M} + \mathbf{N}$ with $\|\mathbf{N}\|_{F} \le
\Delta$, complete $\mathbf{M}$ to Frobenius norm distance $\approx
r^{1.5}\Delta$ in the same runtimes as the noiseless setting. Prior noisy
matrix completion algorithms [CP10] only guaranteed a distance of $\approx
\sqrt{n}\Delta$.

<p class="mathjax">Real-world applications of computational fluid dynamics often involve the
evaluation of quantities of interest for several distinct geometries that
define the computational domain or are embedded inside it. For example, design
optimization studies require the realization of response surfaces from the
parameters that determine the geometrical deformations to relevant outputs to
be optimized. In this context, a crucial aspect to be addressed are the limited
resources at disposal to computationally generate different geometries or to
physically obtain them from direct measurements. This is the case for
patient-specific biomedical applications for example. When additional linear
geometrical constraints need to be imposed, the computational costs increase
substantially. Such constraints include total volume conservation, barycenter
location and fixed moments of inertia. We develop a new paradigm that employs
generative models from machine learning to efficiently sample new geometries
with linear constraints. A consequence of our approach is the reduction of the
parameter space from the original geometrical parametrization to a
low-dimensional latent space of the generative models. Crucial is the
assessment of the quality of the distribution of the constrained geometries
obtained with respect to physical and geometrical quantities of interest.
Non-intrusive model order reduction is enhanced since smaller parametric spaces
are considered. We test our methodology on two academic test cases: a mixed
Poisson problem on the 3d Stanford bunny with fixed barycenter deformations and
the multiphase turbulent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the
Duisburg test case with fixed volume deformations of the naval hull.

<p class="mathjax">Early prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is crucial for effective
battery management across various industries, ranging from household appliances
to large-scale applications. Accurate RUL prediction improves the reliability
and maintainability of battery technology. However, existing methods have
limitations, including assumptions of data from the same sensors or
distribution, foreknowledge of the end of life (EOL), and neglect to determine
the first prediction cycle (FPC) to identify the start of the unhealthy stage.
This paper proposes a novel method for RUL prediction of Lithium-ion batteries.
The proposed framework comprises two stages: determining the FPC using a neural
network-based model to divide the degradation data into distinct health states
and predicting the degradation pattern after the FPC to estimate the remaining
useful life as a percentage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms conventional approaches in terms of RUL prediction.
Furthermore, the proposed method shows promise for real-world scenarios,
providing improved accuracy and applicability for battery management.

question from the observational data under the existence of unmeasured
confounders. In Pearl's framework of using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to
capture the causal intervention, a Diffusion-based Causal Model (DCM) was
proposed incorporating the diffusion model to answer the causal questions more
accurately, assuming that all of the confounders are observed. However,
unmeasured confounders in practice exist, which hinders DCM from being
applicable. To alleviate this limitation of DCM, we propose an extended model
called Backdoor Criterion based DCM (BDCM), whose idea is rooted in the
Backdoor criterion to find the variables in DAG to be included in the decoding
process of the diffusion model so that we can extend DCM to the case with
unmeasured confounders. Synthetic data experiment demonstrates that our
proposed model captures the counterfactual distribution more precisely than DCM
under the unmeasured confounders.

<p class="mathjax">Fusarium head blight is a devastating disease that causes significant
economic losses annually on small grains. Efficiency, accuracy, and timely
detection of FHB in the resistance screening are critical for wheat and barley
breeding programs. In recent years, various image processing techniques have
been developed using supervised machine learning algorithms for the early
detection of FHB. The state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based
methods, such as U-Net, employ a series of encoding blocks to create a local
representation and a series of decoding blocks to capture the semantic
relations. However, these methods are not often capable of long-range modeling
dependencies inside the input data, and their ability to model multi-scale
objects with significant variations in texture and shape is limited. Vision
transformers as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention
mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence prediction, due to insufficient low-level
details, may also limit localization capabilities. To overcome these
limitations, a new Context Bridge is proposed to integrate the local
representation capability of the U-Net network in the transformer model. In
addition, the standard attention mechanism of the original transformer is
replaced with Efficient Self-attention, which is less complicated than other
state-of-the-art methods. To train the proposed network, 12,000 wheat images
from an FHB-inoculated wheat field at the SDSU research farm in Volga, SD, were
captured. In addition to healthy and unhealthy plants, these images encompass
various stages of the disease. A team of expert pathologists annotated the
images for training and evaluating the developed model. As a result, the
effectiveness of the transformer-based method for FHB-disease detection,
through extensive experiments across typical tasks for plant image
segmentation, is demonstrated.

<p class="mathjax">Comparative visualization of scalar fields is often facilitated using
similarity measures such as edit distances. In this paper, we describe a novel
approach for similarity analysis of scalar fields that combines two recently
introduced techniques: Wasserstein geodesics/barycenters as well as path
mappings, a branch decomposition-independent edit distance. Effectively, we are
able to leverage the reduced susceptibility of path mappings to small
perturbations in the data when compared with the original Wasserstein distance.
Our approach therefore exhibits superior performance and quality in typical
tasks such as ensemble summarization, ensemble clustering, and temporal
reduction of time series, while retaining practically feasible runtimes. Beyond
studying theoretical properties of our approach and discussing implementation
aspects, we describe a number of case studies that provide empirical insights
into its utility for comparative visualization, and demonstrate the advantages
of our method in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. We supply a C++
implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.

<p class="mathjax">The IceCube experiment has substantial simulation needs and is in continuous
search for the most cost-effective ways to satisfy them. The most CPU-intensive
part relies on CORSIKA, a cosmic ray air shower simulation. Historically,
IceCube relied exclusively on x86-based CPUs, like Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC, but
recently server-class ARM-based CPUs are also becoming available, both on-prem
and in the cloud. In this paper we present our experience in running a sample
CORSIKA simulation on both ARM and x86 CPUs available through Google Kubernetes
Engine (GKE). We used the production binaries for the x86 instances, but had to
build the binaries for ARM instances from source code, which turned out to be
mostly painless. Our benchmarks show that ARM-based CPUs in GKE were not only
the most cost-effective but were also the fastest in absolute terms in all the
tested configurations. While the advantage is not drastic, about 20% in
cost-effectiveness and less than 10% in absolute terms, it is still large
enough to warrant an investment in ARM support for IceCube.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in foundation models present new opportunities for
interpretable visual recognition -- one can first query Large Language Models
(LLMs) to obtain a set of attributes that describe each class, then apply
vision-language models to classify images via these attributes. Pioneering work
shows that querying thousands of attributes can achieve performance competitive
with image features. However, our further investigation on 8 datasets reveals
that LLM-generated attributes in a large quantity perform almost the same as
random words. This surprising finding suggests that significant noise may be
present in these attributes. We hypothesize that there exist subsets of
attributes that can maintain the classification performance with much smaller
sizes, and propose a novel learning-to-search method to discover those concise
sets of attributes. As a result, on the CUB dataset, our method achieves
performance close to that of massive LLM-generated attributes (e.g., 10k
attributes for CUB), yet using only 32 attributes in total to distinguish 200
bird species. Furthermore, our new paradigm demonstrates several additional
benefits: higher interpretability and interactivity for humans, and the ability
to summarize knowledge for a recognition task.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly smart and autonomous,
targeting real-world pragmatic missions beyond traditional NLP tasks. As a
result, there has been an urgent need to evaluate LLMs as agents on challenging
tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional
evolving benchmark that currently consists of 8 distinct environments to assess
LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities in a multi-turn
open-ended generation setting. Our extensive test over 25 LLMs (including APIs
and open-sourced models) shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong
ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant
disparity in performance between them and open-sourced competitors. It also
serves as a component of an ongoing project with wider coverage and deeper
consideration towards systematic LLM evaluation. Datasets, environments, and an
integrated evaluation package for AgentBench are released at

job. Such a collaboration, however, requires to pay attention to many aspects.
Firstly, it is crucial to enable a communication between this two actors that
is natural and efficient. Secondly, the robot behavior must always be compliant
with the safety regulations, ensuring always a safe collaboration. In this
paper, we propose a framework that enables multi-channel communication between
humans and robots by leveraging multimodal fusion of voice and gesture commands
while always respecting safety regulations. The framework is validated through
a comparative experiment, demonstrating that, thanks to multimodal
communication, the robot can extract valuable information for performing the
required task and additionally, with the safety layer, the robot can scale its
speed to ensure the operator's safety.

<p class="mathjax">We study Lindstrom quantifiers that satisfy certain closure properties which
are motivated by the study of polymorphisms in the context of constraint
satisfaction problems (CSP). When the algebra of polymorphisms of a finite
structure B satisfies certain equations, this gives rise to a natural closure
condition on the class of structures that map homomorphically to B. The
collection of quantifiers that satisfy closure conditions arising from a fixed
set of equations are rather more general than those arising as CSP. For any
such conditions P, we define a pebble game that delimits the distinguishing
power of the infinitary logic with all quantifiers that are P-closed. We use
the pebble game to show that the problem of deciding whether a system of linear
equations is solvable in Z2 is not expressible in the infinitary logic with all
quantifiers closed under a near-unanimity condition.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, widespread 3D graphics (e.g., point clouds and meshes) have drawn
considerable efforts from academia and industry to assess their perceptual
quality by conducting subjective experiments. However, lacking a handy software
for 3D subjective experiments complicates the construction of 3D graphics
quality assessment datasets, thus hindering the prosperity of relevant fields.
In this paper, we develop a powerful platform with which users can flexibly
design their 3D subjective methodologies and build high-quality datasets,
easing a broad spectrum of 3D graphics subjective quality study. To accurately
illustrate the perceptual quality differences of 3D stimuli, our software can
simultaneously render the source stimulus and impaired stimulus and allows both
stimuli to respond synchronously to viewer interactions. Compared with amateur
3D visualization tool-based or image/video rendering-based schemes, our
approach embodies typical 3D applications while minimizing cognitive overload
during subjective experiments. We organized a subjective experiment involving
40 participants to verify the validity of the proposed software. Experimental
analyses demonstrate that subjective tests on our software can produce
reasonable subjective quality scores of 3D models. All resources in this paper

<p class="mathjax">Video-based person Re-Identification (V-ReID) aims to retrieve specific
persons from raw videos captured by non-overlapped cameras. As a fundamental
task, it spreads many multimedia and computer vision applications. However, due
to the variations of persons and scenes, there are still many obstacles that
must be overcome for high performance. In this work, we notice that both the
long-term and short-term information of persons are important for robust video
representations. Thus, we propose a novel deep learning framework named Long
Short-Term Representation Learning (LSTRL) for effective V-ReID. More
specifically, to extract long-term representations, we propose a
Multi-granularity Appearance Extractor (MAE), in which four granularity
appearances are effectively captured across multiple frames. Meanwhile, to
extract short-term representations, we propose a Bi-direction Motion Estimator
(BME), in which reciprocal motion information is efficiently extracted from
consecutive frames. The MAE and BME are plug-and-play and can be easily
inserted into existing networks for efficient feature learning. As a result,
they significantly improve the feature representation ability for V-ReID.
Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks show that our proposed
approach can deliver better performances than most state-of-the-arts.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the tremendous advances achieved over the past years by deep learning
techniques, the latest risk prediction models for industrial applications still
rely on highly handtuned stage-wised statistical learning tools, such as
gradient boosting and random forest methods. Different from images or
languages, real-world financial data are high-dimensional, sparse, noisy and
extremely imbalanced, which makes deep neural network models particularly
challenging to train and fragile in practice. In this work, we propose DeRisk,
an effective deep learning risk prediction framework for credit risk prediction
on real-world financial data. DeRisk is the first deep risk prediction model
that outperforms statistical learning approaches deployed in our company's
production system. We also perform extensive ablation studies on our method to
present the most critical factors for the empirical success of DeRisk.

<p class="mathjax">Logic-based approaches to AI have the advantage that their behavior can in
principle be explained with the help of proofs of the computed consequences.
For ontologies based on Description Logic (DL), we have put this advantage into
practice by showing how proofs for consequences derived by DL reasoners can be
computed and displayed in a user-friendly way. However, these methods are
insufficient in applications where also numerical reasoning is relevant. The
present paper considers proofs for DLs extended with concrete domains (CDs)
based on the rational numbers, which leave reasoning tractable if integrated
into the lightweight DL $\mathcal{E}\hspace{-0.1em}\mathcal{L}_\bot$. Since no
implemented DL reasoner supports these CDs, we first develop reasoning
procedures for them, and show how they can be combined with reasoning
approaches for pure DLs, both for $\mathcal{E}\hspace{-0.1em}\mathcal{L}_\bot$
and the more expressive DL $\mathcal{ALC}$. These procedures are designed such
that it is easy to extract proofs from them. We show how the extracted CD
proofs can be combined with proofs on the DL side into integrated proofs that
explain both the DL and the CD reasoning.

<p class="mathjax">Existing polyp segmentation models from colonoscopy images often fail to
provide reliable segmentation results on datasets from different centers,
limiting their applicability. Our objective in this study is to create a robust
and well-generalized segmentation model named PrototypeLab that can assist in
polyp segmentation. To achieve this, we incorporate various lighting modes such
as White light imaging (WLI), Blue light imaging (BLI), Linked color imaging
(LCI), and Flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (FICE) into our new
segmentation model, that learns to create prototypes for each class of object
present in the images. These prototypes represent the characteristic features
of the objects, such as their shape, texture, color. Our model is designed to
perform effectively on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets from multiple
centers. We first generate a coarse mask that is used to learn prototypes for
the main object class, which are then employed to generate the final
segmentation mask. By using prototypes to represent the main class, our
approach handles the variability present in the medical images and generalize
well to new data since prototype capture the underlying distribution of the
data. PrototypeLab offers a promising solution with a dice coefficient of
$\geq$ 90\% and mIoU $\geq$ 85\% with a near real-time processing speed for
polyp segmentation. It achieved superior performance on OOD datasets compared
to 16 state-of-the-art image segmentation architectures, potentially improving
clinical outcomes. Codes are available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper asks whether current self-supervised learning methods, if
sufficiently scaled up, would be able to reach human-level visual object
recognition capabilities with the same type and amount of visual experience
humans learn from. Previous work on this question only considered the scaling
of data size. Here, we consider the simultaneous scaling of data size, model
size, and image resolution. We perform a scaling experiment with vision
transformers up to 633M parameters in size (ViT-H/14) trained with up to 5K
hours of human-like video data (long, continuous, mostly egocentric videos)
with image resolutions of up to 476x476 pixels. The efficiency of masked
autoencoders (MAEs) as a self-supervised learning algorithm makes it possible
to run this scaling experiment on an unassuming academic budget. We find that
it is feasible to reach human-level object recognition capacity at sub-human
scales of model size, data size, and image size, if these factors are scaled up
simultaneously. To give a concrete example, we estimate that a 2.5B parameter
ViT model trained with 20K hours (2.3 years) of human-like video data with a
spatial resolution of 952x952 pixels should be able to reach human-level
accuracy on ImageNet. Human-level competence is thus achievable for a
fundamental perceptual capability from human-like perceptual experience
(human-like in both amount and type) with extremely generic learning algorithms
and architectures and without any substantive inductive biases.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-node communication, which refers to the interaction among multiple
devices, has attracted lots of attention in many Internet-of-Things (IoT)
scenarios. However, its huge amounts of data flows and inflexibility for task
extension have triggered the urgent requirement of communication-efficient
distributed data transmission frameworks. In this paper, inspired by the great
superiorities on bandwidth reduction and task adaptation of semantic
communications, we propose a federated learning-based semantic communication
(FLSC) framework for multi-task distributed image transmission with IoT
devices. Federated learning enables the design of independent semantic
communication link of each user while further improves the semantic extraction
and task performance through global aggregation. Each link in FLSC is composed
of a hierarchical vision transformer (HVT)-based extractor and a task-adaptive
translator for coarse-to-fine semantic extraction and meaning translation
according to specific tasks. In order to extend the FLSC into more realistic
conditions, we design a channel state information-based multiple-input
multiple-output transmission module to combat channel fading and noise.
Simulation results show that the coarse semantic information can deal with a
range of image-level tasks. Moreover, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio
and channel bandwidth ratio regimes, FLSC evidently outperforms the traditional
scheme, e.g. about 10 peak signal-to-noise ratio gain in the 3 dB channel
condition.

<p class="mathjax">Peripheral nerve blocks are crucial to treatment of post-surgical pain and
are associated with reduction in perioperative opioid use and hospital stay.
Accurate interpretation of sono-anatomy is critical for the success of
ultrasound (US) guided peripheral nerve blocks and can be challenging to the
new operators. This prospective study enrolled 227 subjects who were
systematically scanned for supraclavicular and interscalene brachial plexus in
various settings using three different US machines to create a dataset of 227
unique videos. In total, 41,000 video frames were annotated by experienced
anaesthesiologists using partial automation with object tracking and active
contour algorithms. Four baseline neural network models were trained on the
dataset and their performance was evaluated for object detection and
segmentation tasks. Generalizability of the best suited model was then tested
on the datasets constructed from separate US scanners with and without
fine-tuning. The results demonstrate that deep learning models can be leveraged
for real time segmentation of supraclavicular brachial plexus in neck
ultrasonography videos with high accuracy and reliability. Model was also
tested for its ability to differentiate between supraclavicular and adjoining
interscalene brachial plexus. The entire dataset has been released publicly for
further study by the research community.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a GNN-based method for exploiting semantics and local
geometry to guide the identification of reliable pointcloud registration
candidates. Semantic and morphological features of the environment serve as key
reference points for registration, enabling accurate lidar-based pose
estimation. Our novel lightweight static graph structure informs our
attention-based keypoint node aggregation GNN network by identifying semantic
instance-based relationships, acting as inductive bias to significantly reduce
the computational burden of pointcloud registration. By connecting candidate
nodes and exploiting cross-graph attention, we identify confidence scores for
all potential registration correspondences, estimating the displacement between
pointcloud scans. Our pipeline enables introspective analysis of the model's
performance by correlating it with the individual contributions of local
structures in the environment, providing valuable insights into the system's
behaviour. We test our method on the KITTI odometry dataset, achieving
competitive accuracy compared to benchmark methods and a higher track
smoothness while relying on significantly fewer network parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Clinically deployed segmentation models are known to fail on data outside of
their training distribution. As these models perform well on most cases, it is
imperative to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) images at inference to protect
against automation bias. This work applies the Mahalanobis distance post hoc to
the bottleneck features of a Swin UNETR model that segments the liver on
T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. By reducing the dimensions of the
bottleneck features with principal component analysis, OOD images were detected
with high performance and minimal computational load.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV) aims to detect the event
timestamps described by the natural language query from untrimmed videos. This
paper discusses the challenge of achieving efficient computation in TSGV models
while maintaining high performance. Most existing approaches exquisitely design
complex architectures to improve accuracy with extra layers and loss, suffering
from inefficiency and heaviness. Although some works have noticed that, they
only make an issue of feature fusion layers, which can hardly enjoy the
highspeed merit in the whole clunky network. To tackle this problem, we propose
a novel efficient multi-teacher model (EMTM) based on knowledge distillation to
transfer diverse knowledge from both heterogeneous and isomorphic networks.
Specifically, We first unify different outputs of the heterogeneous models into
one single form. Next, a Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU) is built to acquire
high-quality integrated soft labels from multiple teachers. After that, the KAU
module leverages the multi-scale video and global query information to
adaptively determine the weights of different teachers. A Shared Encoder
strategy is then proposed to solve the problem that the student shallow layers
hardly benefit from teachers, in which an isomorphic teacher is collaboratively
trained with the student to align their hidden states. Extensive experimental
results on three popular TSGV benchmarks demonstrate that our method is both
effective and efficient without bells and whistles.

<p class="mathjax">Segmentation is a fundamental problem in surgical scene analysis using
artificial intelligence. However, the inherent data scarcity in this domain
makes it challenging to adapt traditional segmentation techniques for this
task. To tackle this issue, current research employs pretrained models and
finetunes them on the given data. Even so, these require training deep networks
with millions of parameters every time new data becomes available. A recently
published foundation model, Segment-Anything (SAM), generalizes well to a large
variety of natural images, hence tackling this challenge to a reasonable
extent. However, SAM does not generalize well to the medical domain as is
without utilizing a large amount of compute resources for fine-tuning and using
task-specific prompts. Moreover, these prompts are in the form of
bounding-boxes or foreground/background points that need to be annotated
explicitly for every image, making this solution increasingly tedious with
higher data size. In this work, we propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive
modification of SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently,
while enabling text-prompted segmentation. For finetuning AdaptiveSAM, we
propose an approach called bias-tuning that requires a significantly smaller
number of trainable parameters than SAM (less than 2\%). At the same time,
AdaptiveSAM requires negligible expert intervention since it uses free-form
text as prompt and can segment the object of interest with just the label name
as prompt. Our experiments show that AdaptiveSAM outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods on various medical imaging datasets including surgery,
ultrasound and X-ray. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper is concerned with the robust tracking control of linear uncertain
systems, whose unknown system parameters and disturbances are bounded within
ellipsoidal sets. We propose an adaptive robust control that can actively learn
the ellipsoid sets. Particularly, the proposed approach utilizes the recursive
set-membership state estimation in learning the ellipsoidal sets, aiming at
mitigating uncertainties in the system control. Upon the learned sets
representing the recognized uncertainties, we construct a robust control with
one-step prediction for system output tracking. In deriving an optimized
control law, we reformulate the optimization objective into a second-order cone
programming problem that can be solved in a computationally friendly way. To
further stimulate the active learning of uncertainties over the control
procedures, we enrich the information used for the learning by maximizing the
volume of the ellipsoid set, supposed to lead to increased learning accuracy
and accelerated uncertainty reduction. To verify our approach, we conduct
numerical simulations to compare the fixed-ellipsoidal-set robust control with
ours, and investigate the positive effect of the designed active learning in
the uncertain system control process.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Among these
cutting-edge developments, Google's Bard stands out for its remarkable
multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning
across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of
LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a
lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the
vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties.
Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal
capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual
reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence,
through quantitative evaluation of $42$ standard text-related visual
benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions
using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and
accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation
compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere $2.1$K
image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their
own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study
demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal
capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible.
Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages
innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques. Our project is

<p class="mathjax">An explanation method called SurvBeX is proposed to interpret predictions of
the machine learning survival black-box models. The main idea behind the method
is to use the modified Beran estimator as the surrogate explanation model.
Coefficients, incorporated into Beran estimator, can be regarded as values of
the feature impacts on the black-box model prediction. Following the well-known
LIME method, many points are generated in a local area around an example of
interest. For every generated example, the survival function of the black-box
model is computed, and the survival function of the surrogate model (the Beran
estimator) is constructed as a function of the explanation coefficients. In
order to find the explanation coefficients, it is proposed to minimize the mean
distance between the survival functions of the black-box model and the Beran
estimator produced by the generated examples. Many numerical experiments with
synthetic and real survival data demonstrate the SurvBeX efficiency and compare
the method with the well-known method SurvLIME. The method is also compared
with the method SurvSHAP. The code implementing SurvBeX is available at:

<p class="mathjax">The entity resolution problem requires finding pairs across datasets that
belong to different owners but refer to the same entity in the real world. To
train and evaluate solutions (either rule-based or machine-learning-based) to
the entity resolution problem, generating a ground truth dataset with entity
pairs or clusters is needed. However, such a data annotation process involves
humans as domain oracles to review the plaintext data for all candidate record
pairs from different parties, which inevitably infringes the privacy of data
owners, especially in privacy-sensitive cases like medical records. To the best
of our knowledge, there is no prior work on privacy-preserving ground truth
dataset generation, especially in the domain of entity resolution. We propose a
novel blind annotation protocol based on homomorphic encryption that allows
domain oracles to collaboratively label ground truths without sharing data in
plaintext with other parties. In addition, we design a domain-specific
easy-to-use language that hides the sophisticated underlying homomorphic
encryption layer. Rigorous proof of the privacy guarantee is provided and our
empirical experiments via an annotation simulator indicate the feasibility of
our privacy-preserving protocol (f-measure on average achieves more than 90\%
compared with the real ground truths).

<p class="mathjax">Personalized recommendations form an important part of today's internet
ecosystem, helping artists and creators to reach interested users, and helping
users to discover new and engaging content. However, many users today are
skeptical of platforms that personalize recommendations, in part due to
historically careless treatment of personal data and data privacy. Now,
businesses that rely on personalized recommendations are entering a new
paradigm, where many of their systems must be overhauled to be privacy-first.
In this article, we propose an algorithm for personalized recommendations that
facilitates both precise and differentially-private measurement. We consider
advertising as an example application, and conduct offline experiments to
quantify how the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm affects key metrics
related to user experience, advertiser value, and platform revenue compared to
the extremes of both (private) non-personalized and non-private, personalized
implementations.

<p class="mathjax">Despite speculation that recent large language models (LLMs) are likely to be
used maliciously to improve the quality or scale of influence operations,
uncertainty persists regarding the economic value that LLMs offer
propagandists. This research constructs a model of costs facing propagandists
for content generation at scale and analyzes (1) the potential savings that
LLMs could offer propagandists, (2) the potential deterrent effect of
monitoring controls on API-accessible LLMs, and (3) the optimal strategy for
propagandists choosing between multiple private and/or open source LLMs when
conducting influence operations. Primary results suggest that LLMs need only
produce usable outputs with relatively low reliability (roughly 25%) to offer
cost savings to propagandists, that the potential reduction in content
generation costs can be quite high (up to 70% for a highly reliable model), and
that monitoring capabilities have sharply limited cost imposition effects when
alternative open source models are available. In addition, these results
suggest that nation-states -- even those conducting many large-scale influence
operations per year -- are unlikely to benefit economically from training
custom LLMs specifically for use in influence operations.

<p class="mathjax">In line with the human capacity to perceive the world by simultaneously
processing and integrating high-dimensional inputs from multiple modalities
like vision and audio, we propose a novel model, MAiVAR-T (Multimodal
Audio-Image to Video Action Recognition Transformer). This model employs an
intuitive approach for the combination of audio-image and video modalities,
with a primary aim to escalate the effectiveness of multimodal human action
recognition (MHAR). At the core of MAiVAR-T lies the significance of distilling
substantial representations from the audio modality and transmuting these into
the image domain. Subsequently, this audio-image depiction is fused with the
video modality to formulate a unified representation. This concerted approach
strives to exploit the contextual richness inherent in both audio and video
modalities, thereby promoting action recognition. In contrast to existing
state-of-the-art strategies that focus solely on audio or video modalities,
MAiVAR-T demonstrates superior performance. Our extensive empirical evaluations
conducted on a benchmark action recognition dataset corroborate the model's
remarkable performance. This underscores the potential enhancements derived
from integrating audio and video modalities for action recognition purposes.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we aim to study how to build a strong instance segmenter with
minimal training time and GPUs, as opposed to the majority of current
approaches that pursue more accurate instance segmenter by building more
advanced frameworks at the cost of longer training time and higher GPU
requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a simple and general framework,
termed Mask Frozen-DETR, which can convert any existing DETR-based object
detection model into a powerful instance segmentation model. Our method only
requires training an additional lightweight mask network that predicts instance
masks within the bounding boxes given by a frozen DETR-based object detector.
Remarkably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art instance segmentation
method Mask DINO in terms of performance on the COCO test-dev split (55.3% vs.
54.7%) while being over 10X times faster to train. Furthermore, all of our
experiments can be trained using only one Tesla V100 GPU with 16 GB of memory,
demonstrating the significant efficiency of our proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR-based fully sparse architecture has garnered increasing attention.
FSDv1 stands out as a representative work, achieving impressive efficacy and
efficiency, albeit with intricate structures and handcrafted designs. In this
paper, we present FSDv2, an evolution that aims to simplify the previous FSDv1
while eliminating the inductive bias introduced by its handcrafted
instance-level representation, thus promoting better general applicability. To
this end, we introduce the concept of \textbf{virtual voxels}, which takes over
the clustering-based instance segmentation in FSDv1. Virtual voxels not only
address the notorious issue of the Center Feature Missing problem in fully
sparse detectors but also endow the framework with a more elegant and
streamlined approach. Consequently, we develop a suite of components to
complement the virtual voxel concept, including a virtual voxel encoder, a
virtual voxel mixer, and a virtual voxel assignment strategy. Through empirical
validation, we demonstrate that the virtual voxel mechanism is functionally
similar to the handcrafted clustering in FSDv1 while being more general. We
conduct experiments on three large-scale datasets: Waymo Open Dataset,
Argoverse 2 dataset, and nuScenes dataset. Our results showcase
state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets, highlighting the
superiority of FSDv2 in long-range scenarios and its general applicability to
achieve competitive performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we provide
comprehensive experimental analysis to elucidate the workings of FSDv2. To
foster reproducibility and further research, we have open-sourced FSDv2 at

represent the scene with time-varying radiance fields and leverage the Eulerian
principle for motion magnification to extract and amplify the variation of the
embedding of a fixed point over time. We study and validate our proposed

<p class="mathjax">Directed topology was introduced as a model of concurrent programs, where the
flow of time is described by distinguishing certain paths in the topological
space representing such a program. Algebraic invariants which respect this
directedness have been introduced to classify directed spaces. In this work we
study the properties of such invariants with respect to the reversal of the
flow of time in directed spaces. Known invariants, natural homotopy and
homology, have been shown to be unchanged under this time-reversal. We show
that these can be equipped with additional algebraic structure witnessing this
reversal. Specifically, when applied to a directed space and to its reversal,
we show that these refined invariants yield dual objects. We further refine
natural homotopy by introducing a notion of relative directed homotopy and
showing the existence of a long exact sequence of natural homotopy systems.

homology for the classification of directed spaces. The former is an algebraic
invariant of directed spaces, a semantic model of concurrent programs. The
latter was developed in the context of topological data analysis, in which
topological properties of point-cloud data sets are extracted while eliminating
noise. In both approaches, the evolution homological properties are tracked
through a sequence of inclusions of usual topological spaces. Exploiting this
similarity, we show that natural homology may be considered a persistence
object, and may be calculated as a colimit of uni-dimensional persistent
homologies along traces. Finally, we suggest further links and avenues of
future work in this direction.

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Yet, despite its
importance, publicly available value chain datasets, such as the ``World
Input-Output Database'', ``Inter-Country Input-Output Tables'', ``EXIOBASE'' or
the ``EORA'', lack detailed information about products (e.g. Radio Receivers,
Telephones, Electrical Capacitors, LCDs, etc.) and rely instead on more
aggregate industrial sectors (e.g. Electrical Equipment, Telecommunications).
Here, we introduce a method based on machine learning and trade theory to infer
product-level value chain relationships from fine-grained international trade
data. We apply our method to data summarizing the exports and imports of 300+
world regions (e.g. states in the U.S., prefectures in Japan, etc.) and 1200+
products to infer value chain information implicit in their trade patterns.
Furthermore, we use proportional allocation to assign the trade flow between
regions and countries. This work provides an approximate method to map value
chain data at the product level with a relevant trade flow, that should be of
interest to people working in logistics, trade, and sustainable development.

<p class="mathjax">Body fat volume and distribution can be a strong indication for a person's
overall health and the risk for developing diseases like type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases. Frequently used measures for fat estimation are the
body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or the waist-hip-ratio. However,
those are rather imprecise measures that do not allow for a discrimination
between different types of fat or between fat and muscle tissue. The estimation
of visceral (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT) adipose tissue volume has
shown to be a more accurate measure for named risk factors. In this work, we
show that triangulated body surface meshes can be used to accurately predict
VAT and ASAT volumes using graph neural networks. Our methods achieve high
performance while reducing training time and required resources compared to
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in this area. We furthermore
envision this method to be applicable to cheaper and easily accessible medical
surface scans instead of expensive medical images.

<p class="mathjax">Scene representation networks (SRNs) have been recently proposed for
compression and visualization of scientific data. However, state-of-the-art
SRNs do not adapt the allocation of available network parameters to the complex
features found in scientific data, leading to a loss in reconstruction quality.
We address this shortcoming with an adaptively placed multi-grid SRN (APMGSRN)
and propose a domain decomposition training and inference technique for
accelerated parallel training on multi-GPU systems. We also release an
open-source neural volume rendering application that allows plug-and-play
rendering with any PyTorch-based SRN. Our proposed APMGSRN architecture uses
multiple spatially adaptive feature grids that learn where to be placed within
the domain to dynamically allocate more neural network resources where error is
high in the volume, improving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy of SRNs
for scientific data without requiring expensive octree refining, pruning, and
traversal like previous adaptive models. In our domain decomposition approach
for representing large-scale data, we train an set of APMGSRNs in parallel on
separate bricks of the volume to reduce training time while avoiding overhead
necessary for an out-of-core solution for volumes too large to fit in GPU
memory. After training, the lightweight SRNs are used for realtime neural
volume rendering in our open-source renderer, where arbitrary view angles and
transfer functions can be explored. A copy of this paper, all code, all models
used in our experiments, and all supplemental materials and videos are
available at https://github.com/skywolf829/APMGSRN.

<p class="mathjax">Noisy labels can significantly affect the performance of deep neural networks
(DNNs). In medical image segmentation tasks, annotations are error-prone due to
the high demand in annotation time and in the annotators' expertise. Existing
methods mostly assume noisy labels in different pixels are \textit{i.i.d}.
However, segmentation label noise usually has strong spatial correlation and
has prominent bias in distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov
model for segmentation noisy annotations that encodes both spatial correlation
and bias. Further, to mitigate such label noise, we propose a label correction
method to recover true label progressively. We provide theoretical guarantees
of the correctness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world
noisy annotations.

<p class="mathjax">Garbage disposal is a challenging problem throughout the developed world. In
Cyprus, as elsewhere, illegal ``fly-tipping" is a significant issue, especially
in rural areas where few legal garbage disposal options exist. However, there
is a lack of studies that attempt to measure the scale of this problem, and few
resources available to address it. A method of automating the process of
identifying garbage dumps would help counter this and provide information to
the relevant authorities. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree
to which artificial intelligence techniques, together with satellite imagery,
can be used to identify illegal garbage dumps in the rural areas of Cyprus.
This involved collecting a novel dataset of images that could be categorised as
either containing, or not containing, garbage. The collection of such datasets
in sufficient raw quantities is time consuming and costly. Therefore a
relatively modest baseline set of images was collected, then data augmentation
techniques used to increase the size of this dataset to a point where useful
machine learning could occur. From this set of images an artificial neural
network was trained to recognise the presence or absence of garbage in new
images. A type of neural network especially suited to this task known as
``convolutional neural networks" was used. The efficacy of the resulting model
was evaluated using an independently collected dataset of test images. The
result was a deep learning model that could correctly identify images
containing garbage in approximately 90\% of cases. It is envisaged that this
model could form the basis of a future system that could systematically analyse
the entire landscape of Cyprus to build a comprehensive ``garbage" map of the
island.

roles between contributors and annotators. The platform incorporates a quality
assurance system that filters out low-quality and spurious recordings before
sending them for validation. During the validation phase, contributors can
assess the quality of recordings, annotate them, and provide feedback which is
then reviewed by administrators. Furthermore, the platform offers flexibility

<p class="mathjax">In biomedical image analysis, data imbalance is common across several imaging
modalities. Data augmentation is one of the key solutions in addressing this
limitation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly being
relied upon for data augmentation tasks. Biomedical image features are
sensitive to evaluating the efficacy of synthetic images. These features can
have a significant impact on metric scores when evaluating synthetic images
across different biomedical imaging modalities. Synthetically generated images
can be evaluated by comparing the diversity and quality of real images.
Multi-scale Structural Similarity Index Measure and Cosine Distance are used to
evaluate intra-class diversity, while Frechet Inception Distance is used to
evaluate the quality of synthetic images. Assessing these metrics for
biomedical and non-biomedical imaging is important to investigate an informed
strategy in evaluating the diversity and quality of synthetic images. In this
work, an empirical assessment of these metrics is conducted for the Deep
Convolutional GAN in a biomedical and non-biomedical setting. The diversity and
quality of synthetic images are evaluated using different sample sizes. This
research intends to investigate the variance in diversity and quality across
biomedical and non-biomedical imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that the
metrics scores for diversity and quality vary significantly across
biomedical-to-biomedical and biomedical-to-non-biomedical imaging modalities.

<p class="mathjax">The usual FIFA World Cup-TM group stage format is eight groups of four teams
for a total of 32 teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the next
round, resulting in a 16-team knockout stage. The next edition of the World Cup
will have 48 teams. Although FIFA initially proposed a configuration of 16
three-team groups, it has ultimately settled on 12 four-team groups. The format
chosen, based on four-team groups, has clear organizational disadvantages and
even a lack of fairness in the competition. But, in return, there is less risk
of collusion in groups of four teams than in groups of three teams. This study
proposes a modification to the three-team group format to reduce the risk of
collusion by making the order of the matches not predefined in advance. The
results obtained with Monte Carlo simulations show that the new three-team
competition format with dynamic match order is comparable, in terms of
collusion risk, to the four-team group system commonly used in past World Cups.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing frequency of catastrophic natural events, such as wildfires,
calls for the development of rapid and automated wildfire detection systems. In
this paper, we propose a wildfire identification solution to improve the
accuracy of automated satellite-based hotspot detection systems by leveraging
multiple information sources. We cross-reference the thermal anomalies detected
by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible
Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) hotspot services with the European
Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) database to construct a large-scale
hotspot dataset for wildfire-related studies in Europe. Then, we propose a
novel multimodal supervised machine learning approach to disambiguate hotspot
detections, distinguishing between wildfires and other events. Our methodology
includes the use of multimodal data sources, such as the ERSI annual Land Use
Land Cover (LULC) and the Copernicus Sentinel-3 data. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of wildfire
identification.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic vertebra localization and identification in CT scans is important
for numerous clinical applications. Much progress has been made on this topic,
but it mostly targets positional localization of vertebrae, ignoring their
orientation. Additionally, most methods employ heuristics in their pipeline
that can be sensitive in real clinical images which tend to contain
abnormalities. We introduce a simple pipeline that employs a standard
prediction with a U-Net, followed by a single graph neural network to associate
and classify vertebrae with full orientation. To test our method, we introduce
a new vertebra dataset that also contains pedicle detections that are
associated with vertebra bodies, creating a more challenging landmark
prediction, association and classification task. Our method is able to
accurately associate the correct body and pedicle landmarks, ignore false
positives and classify vertebrae in a simple, fully trainable pipeline avoiding
application-specific heuristics. We show our method outperforms traditional
approaches such as Hungarian Matching and Hidden Markov Models. We also show
competitive performance on the standard VerSe challenge body identification
task.

<p class="mathjax">Seeing is believing, however, the underlying mechanism of how human visual
perceptions are intertwined with our cognitions is still a mystery. Thanks to
the recent advances in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, we have
been able to record the visually evoked brain activities and mimic the visual
perception ability through computational approaches. In this paper, we pay
attention to visual stimuli reconstruction by reconstructing the observed
images based on portably accessible brain signals, i.e., electroencephalography
(EEG) data. Since EEG signals are dynamic in the time-series format and are
notorious to be noisy, processing and extracting useful information requires
more dedicated efforts; In this paper, we propose a comprehensive pipeline,
named NeuroImagen, for reconstructing visual stimuli images from EEG signals.
Specifically, we incorporate a novel multi-level perceptual information
decoding to draw multi-grained outputs from the given EEG data. A latent
diffusion model will then leverage the extracted information to reconstruct the
high-resolution visual stimuli images. The experimental results have
illustrated the effectiveness of image reconstruction and superior quantitative
performance of our proposed method.

relationship between long-distance notes. In this paper, we propose a
polyphonic music generation neural network named Choir Transformer[
https://github.com/Zjy0401/choir-transformer], with relative positional
attention to better model the structure of music. We also proposed a music
representation suitable for polyphonic music generation. The performance of
Choir Transformer surpasses the previous state-of-the-art accuracy of 4.06%. We
also measures the harmony metrics of polyphonic music. Experiments show that
the harmony metrics are close to the music of Bach. In practical application,
the generated melody and rhythm can be adjusted according to the specified
input, with different styles of music like folk music or pop music and so on.

<p class="mathjax">Compiling a quantum circuit for specific quantum hardware is a challenging
task. Moreover, current quantum computers have severe hardware limitations. To
make the most use of the limited resources, the compilation process should be
optimized. To improve currents methods, Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
technique in which an agent interacts with an environment to learn complex
policies to attain a specific goal, can be used. In this work, we present qgym,
a software framework derived from the OpenAI gym, together with environments
that are specifically tailored towards quantum compilation. The goal of qgym is
to connect the research fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with quantum
compilation by abstracting parts of the process that are irrelevant to either
domain. It can be used to train and benchmark RL agents and algorithms in
highly customizable environments.

<p class="mathjax">The single-letter characterization of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a
quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In
this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver
is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an
error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message
conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting
postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the
postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter
characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement
assistance as well as the more general non-signalling assistance, establishing
that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a
variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so
by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower
bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper
bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As
such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even
when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on
communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike
curves.

<p class="mathjax">Cataract surgery is a frequently performed procedure that demands automation
and advanced assistance systems. However, gathering and annotating data for
training such systems is resource intensive. The publicly available data also
comprises severe imbalances inherent to the surgical process. Motivated by
this, we analyse cataract surgery video data for the worst-performing phases of
a pre-trained downstream tool classifier. The analysis demonstrates that
imbalances deteriorate the classifier's performance on underrepresented cases.
To address this challenge, we utilise a conditional generative model based on
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG).
Our model can synthesise diverse, high-quality examples based on complex
multi-class multi-label conditions, such as surgical phases and combinations of
surgical tools. We affirm that the synthesised samples display tools that the
classifier recognises. These samples are hard to differentiate from real
images, even for clinical experts with more than five years of experience.
Further, our synthetically extended data can improve the data sparsity problem
for the downstream task of tool classification. The evaluations demonstrate
that the model can generate valuable unseen examples, allowing the tool
classifier to improve by up to 10% for rare cases. Overall, our approach can
facilitate the development of automated assistance systems for cataract surgery
by providing a reliable source of realistic synthetic data, which we make
available for everyone.

<p class="mathjax">Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis remains challenging due to lacking a
reliable biomarker and limited access to clinical care. In this study, we
present an analysis of the largest video dataset containing micro-expressions
to screen for PD. We collected 3,871 videos from 1,059 unique participants,
including 256 self-reported PD patients. The recordings are from diverse
sources encompassing participants' homes across multiple countries, a clinic,
and a PD care facility in the US. Leveraging facial landmarks and action units,
we extracted features relevant to Hypomimia, a prominent symptom of PD
characterized by reduced facial expressions. An ensemble of AI models trained
on these features achieved an accuracy of 89.7% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 89.3% while being free from detectable bias
across population subgroups based on sex and ethnicity on held-out data.
Further analysis reveals that features from the smiling videos alone lead to
comparable performance, even on two external test sets the model has never seen
during training, suggesting the potential for PD risk assessment from smiling
selfie videos.

<p class="mathjax">We address the relatively less known facts on the equivalence and technical
realizations surrounding two network models showing the "small-world" property,
namely the Newman-Watts and the Harary models. We provide the most accurate (in
terms of faithfulness to the original literature) versions of these models to
clarify the deviation from them existing in their variants adopted in one of
the most popular network analysis packages. The difference in technical
realizations of those models could be conceived as minor details, but we
discover significantly notable changes caused by the possibly inadvertent
modification. For the Harary model, the stochasticity in the original
formulation allows a much wider range of the clustering coefficient and the
average shortest path length. For the Newman-Watts model, due to the
drastically different degree distributions, the clustering coefficient can also
be affected, which is verified by our higher-order analytic derivation. During
the process, we discover the equivalence of the Newman-Watts (better known in
the network science or physics community) and the Harary (better known in the
graph theory or mathematics community) models under a specific condition of
restricted parity in variables, which would bridge the two relatively
independently developed models in different fields. Our result highlights the
importance of each detailed step in constructing network models and the
possibility of deeply related models, even if they might initially appear
distinct in terms of the time period or the academic disciplines from which
they emerged.

<p class="mathjax">Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality. Breast cancer
patients in developing countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
and South America, suffer from the highest mortality rate in the world. One
crucial factor contributing to the global disparity in mortality rate is long
delay of diagnosis due to a severe shortage of trained pathologists, which
consequently has led to a large proportion of late-stage presentation at
diagnosis. The delay between the initial development of symptoms and the
receipt of a diagnosis could stretch upwards 15 months. To tackle this critical
healthcare disparity, this research has developed a deep learning-based
diagnosis system for metastatic breast cancer that can achieve high diagnostic
accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Based on our evaluation, the
MobileNetV2-based diagnostic model outperformed the more complex VGG16,
ResNet50 and ResNet101 models in diagnostic accuracy, model generalization, and
model training efficiency. The visual comparisons between the model prediction
and ground truth have demonstrated that the MobileNetV2 diagnostic models can
identify very small cancerous nodes embedded in a large area of normal cells
which is challenging for manual image analysis. Equally Important, the light
weighted MobleNetV2 models were computationally efficient and ready for mobile
devices or devices of low computational power. These advances empower the
development of a resource-efficient and high performing AI-based metastatic
breast cancer diagnostic system that can adapt to under-resourced healthcare
facilities in developing countries. This research provides an innovative
technological solution to address the long delays in metastatic breast cancer
diagnosis and the consequent disparity in patient survival outcome in
developing countries.

<p class="mathjax">To model complex turbulent flow and heat transfer phenomena, this study aims
to analyze and develop a reduced modeling approach based on artificial neural
network (ANN) and wrapper methods. This approach has an advantage over other
methods such as the correlation-based filter method in terms of removing
redundant or irrelevant parameters even under non-linearity among them. As a
downside, the overfitting and randomness of ANN training may produce
inconsistent subsets over selection trials especially in a higher physical
dimension. This study analyzes a few existing ANN-based wrapper methods and
develops a revised one based on the gradient-based subset selection indices to
minimize the loss in the total derivative or the directional consistency at
each elimination step. To examine parameter reduction performance and
consistency-over-trials, we apply these methods to a manufactured subset
selection problem, modeling of the bubble size in a turbulent bubbly flow, and
modeling of the spatially varying turbulent Prandtl number in a duct flow. It
is found that the gradient-based subset selection to minimize the total
derivative loss results in improved consistency-over-trials compared to the
other ANN-based wrapper methods, while removing unnecessary parameters
successfully. For the reduced turbulent Prandtl number model, the
gradient-based subset selection improves the prediction in the validation case
over the other methods. Also, the reduced parameter subsets show a slight
increase in the training speed compared to the others.

<p class="mathjax">Timely diagnosis of breast cancer is an important task. This type of breast
cancer is one of the most common diseases. The method of microwave
radiothermometry is a promising direction for solving this problem. The method
is based on measuring internal temperature of biological tissues in microwave
frequency range. Computer simulations are used to improve the quality of
diagnostics. Computer models make it possible to evaluate the effect of heat
release in a malignant tumor on the thermal dynamics inside the mammary gland.
It is necessary to build personalized models, taking into account the
individual nature of the internal structure of the mammary gland in each
patient. One of the problems is the determination of biophysical
characteristics of biological components. Methods for determining these
characteristics using computer simulations are proposed. The coefficient of
thermal conductivity and specific heat of biological tissues are determined
from known temperature distributions. Finding the physical parameters for a
quasihomogeneous biological tissue is the first approximation for solving this
problem. The least squares method is used as a solution method. The results
obtained are in good agreement with previously known exact solutions, which
indicates the applicability of this method for solving this class of problems.
The efficiency of using parallel technologies in solving the inverse problem is
investigated and the applicability of Open MP technology is demonstrated.

<p class="mathjax">The design of a neural image compression network is governed by how well the
entropy model matches the true distribution of the latent code. Apart from the
model capacity, this ability is indirectly under the effect of how close the
relaxed quantization is to the actual hard quantization. Optimizing the
parameters of a rate-distortion variational autoencoder (R-D VAE) is ruled by
this approximated quantization scheme. In this paper, we propose a
feature-level frequency disentanglement to help the relaxed scalar quantization
achieve lower bit rates by guiding the high entropy latent features to include
most of the low-frequency texture of the image. In addition, to strengthen the
de-correlating power of the transformer-based analysis/synthesis transform, an
augmented self-attention score calculation based on the Hadamard product is
utilized during both encoding and decoding. Channel-wise autoregressive entropy
modeling takes advantage of the proposed frequency separation as it inherently
directs high-informational low-frequency channels to the first chunks and
conditions the future chunks on it. The proposed network not only outperforms
hand-engineered codecs, but also neural network-based codecs built on
computation-heavy spatially autoregressive entropy models.

<p class="mathjax">MRI reconstruction techniques based on deep learning have led to
unprecedented reconstruction quality especially in highly accelerated settings.
However, deep learning techniques are also known to fail unexpectedly and
hallucinate structures. This is particularly problematic if reconstructions are
directly used for downstream tasks such as real-time treatment guidance or
automated extraction of clinical paramters (e.g. via segmentation).
Well-calibrated uncertainty quantification will be a key ingredient for safe
use of this technology in clinical practice. In this paper we propose a novel
probabilistic reconstruction technique (PHiRec) building on the idea of
conditional hierarchical variational autoencoders. We demonstrate that our
proposed method produces high-quality reconstructions as well as uncertainty
quantification that is substantially better calibrated than several strong
baselines. We furthermore demonstrate how uncertainties arising in the MR
econstruction can be propagated to a downstream segmentation task, and show
that PHiRec also allows well-calibrated estimation of segmentation
uncertainties that originated in the MR reconstruction process.

<p class="mathjax">The topology of the large-scale structure of the universe contains valuable
information on the underlying cosmological parameters. While persistent
homology can extract this topological information, the optimal method for
parameter estimation from the tool remains an open question. To address this,
we propose a neural network model to map persistence images to cosmological
parameters. Through a parameter recovery test, we demonstrate that our model
makes accurate and precise estimates, considerably outperforming conventional
Bayesian inference approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) project, funded by NASA
starting in 2010, aims to map our meteor showers by triangulating meteor
trajectories detected in low-light video cameras from multiple locations across
16 countries in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Its mission is to
validate, discover, and predict the upcoming returns of meteor showers. Our
research aimed to streamline the data processing by implementing an automated
cloud-based AI-enabled pipeline and improve the data visualization to improve
the rate of discoveries by involving the public in monitoring the meteor
detections. This article describes the process of automating the data
ingestion, processing, and insight generation using an interpretable Active
Learning and AI pipeline. This work also describes the development of an
interactive web portal (the NASA Meteor Shower portal) to facilitate the
visualization of meteor radiant maps. To date, CAMS has discovered over 200 new
meteor showers and has validated dozens of previously reported showers.

<p class="mathjax">Supply chain (SC) risk management is influenced by both spatial and temporal
attributes of different entities (suppliers, retailers, and customers). Each
entity has given capacity and lead time for processing and transporting
products to downstream entities. Under disruptive events, lead time and
capacities may vary, which affects the overall SC performance. There have been
many studies on SC disruption mitigation, but often without considering lead
time and the magnitude of lateness. In this paper, we formulate a mixed-integer
programming (MIP) model to optimize SC operations via a routing and scheduling
approach, to model the delivery time of products at different entities as they
flow throughout the SC network. We minimize a weighted sum of multiple
objectives involving costs related to transportation, shortage, and delivery
lateness. We also develop a discrete-event simulation framework to evaluate the
performance of solutions to the MIP model under lead time uncertainty. Via
extensive numerical studies, we show how the attributes of SC entities affect
the performance, so that we can improve SC design and operations under various
uncertainties.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear stochastic model to describe the
propagation of information inside a computer processor. In this model, a
computational task is divided into stages, and information can flow from one
stage to another. The model is formulated as a spatially-extended,
continuous-time Markov chain where space represents different stages. This
model is equivalent to a spatially-extended version of the M/M/s queue. The
main modeling feature is the throttling function which describes the processor
slowdown when the amount of information falls below a certain threshold. We
derive the stationary distribution for this stochastic model and develop a
closure for a deterministic ODE system that approximates the evolution of the
mean and variance of the stochastic model. We demonstrate the validity of the
closure with numerical simulations.

that this upper bound can be reduced to $n/4$ for planar triangulations when

<p class="mathjax">We propose and analyze a nonlinear dynamic model of continuous-time
multi-dimensional belief formation over signed social networks. Our model
accounts for the effects of a structured belief system, self-appraisal,
internal biases, and various sources of cognitive dissonance posited by recent
theories in social psychology. We prove that strong beliefs emerge on the
network as a consequence of a bifurcation. We analyze how the balance of social
network effects in the model controls the nature of the bifurcation and,
therefore, the belief-forming limit-set solutions. Our analysis provides
constructive conditions on how multi-stable network belief equilibria and
belief oscillations emerging at a belief-forming bifurcation depend on the
communication network graph and belief system network graph. Our model and
analysis provide new theoretical insights on the dynamics of social systems and
a new principled framework for designing decentralized decision-making on
engineered networks in the presence of structured relationships among
alternatives.

<p class="mathjax">Training speaker-discriminative and robust speaker verification systems
without speaker labels is still challenging and worthwhile to explore. Previous
studies have noted a substantial performance disparity between self-supervised
and fully supervised approaches. In this paper, we propose an effective
self-supervised distillation framework with a novel ensemble algorithm named
Ensemble Distillation Network (EDN) to facilitate self-supervised speaker
representation learning. A range of experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the EDN framework in speaker
verification. EDN achieves a new SOTA on Voxceleb1 speaker verification
evaluation benchmark ( i.e., equal error rate 1.94\%, 1.99\%, and 3.77\% for
trial Vox1-O, Vox1-E and Vox1-H , respectively), discarding any speaker labels
in the training phase. Code will be publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">One of the most important study areas in affective computing is emotion
identification using EEG data. In this study, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
algorithm, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), is tested to
see if it can use EEG signals to predict emotional states. Our publicly
accessible dataset consists of resting neutral data as well as EEG recordings
from people who were exposed to stimuli evoking happy, neutral, and negative
emotions. For the best feature extraction, we pre-process the EEG data using
artifact removal, bandpass filters, and normalization methods. With 100%
accuracy on the validation set, our model produced outstanding results by
utilizing the GRU's capacity to capture temporal dependencies. When compared to
other machine learning techniques, our GRU model's Extreme Gradient Boosting
Classifier had the highest accuracy. Our investigation of the confusion matrix
revealed insightful information about the performance of the model, enabling
precise emotion classification. This study emphasizes the potential of deep
learning models like GRUs for emotion recognition and advances in affective
computing. Our findings open up new possibilities for interacting with
computers and comprehending how emotions are expressed through brainwave
activity.

<p class="mathjax">Today's commodity camera systems rely on compound optics to map light
originating from the scene to positions on the sensor where it gets recorded as
an image. To record images without optical aberrations, i.e., deviations from
Gauss' linear model of optics, typical lens systems introduce increasingly
complex stacks of optical elements which are responsible for the height of
existing commodity cameras. In this work, we investigate \emph{flat
nanophotonic computational cameras} as an alternative that employs an array of
skewed lenslets and a learned reconstruction approach. The optical array is
embedded on a metasurface that, at 700~nm height, is flat and sits on the
sensor cover glass at 2.5~mm focal distance from the sensor. To tackle the
highly chromatic response of a metasurface and design the array over the entire
sensor, we propose a differentiable optimization method that continuously
samples over the visible spectrum and factorizes the optical modulation for
different incident fields into individual lenses. We reconstruct a megapixel
image from our flat imager with a \emph{learned probabilistic reconstruction}
method that employs a generative diffusion model to sample an implicit prior.
To tackle \emph{scene-dependent aberrations in broadband}, we propose a method
for acquiring paired captured training data in varying illumination conditions.
We assess the proposed flat camera design in simulation and with an
experimental prototype, validating that the method is capable of recovering
images from diverse scenes in broadband with a single nanophotonic layer.

<p class="mathjax">Osteoporosis and fragility fractures have emerged as major public health
concerns in an aging population. However, measuring age-related changes in bone
density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry has limited personalized risk
assessment due to susceptibility to interference from various factors. In this
study, we propose an innovative statistical model of bone pixel distribution in
fine-segmented computed tomography (CT) images, along with a novel approach to
measuring bone density based on CT values of bone pixels. Our findings indicate
that bone density exhibits a linear decline with age during adulthood between
the ages of 39 and 80, with the rate of decline being approximately 1.6 times
faster in women than in men. This contradicts the widely accepted notion that
bone density starts declining in women at menopause and in men at around 50
years of age. The linearity of age-related changes provides further insights
into the dynamics of the aging human body. Consequently, our findings suggest
that the definition of osteoporosis by the World Health Organization should be
revised to the standard deviation of age-based bone density. Furthermore, these
results open up new avenues for research in bone health care and clinical
investigation of osteoporosis.

<p class="mathjax">We propose the first discrete-time infinite-horizon dynamic formulation of
the financial index tracking problem under both return-based tracking error and
value-based tracking error. The formulation overcomes the limitations of
existing models by incorporating the intertemporal dynamics of market
information variables not limited to prices, allowing exact calculation of
transaction costs, accounting for the tradeoff between overall tracking error
and transaction costs, allowing effective use of data in a long time period,
etc. The formulation also allows novel decision variables of cash injection or
withdraw. We propose to solve the portfolio rebalancing equation using a Banach
fixed point iteration, which allows to accurately calculate the transaction
costs specified as nonlinear functions of trading volumes in practice. We
propose an extension of deep reinforcement learning (RL) method to solve the
dynamic formulation. Our RL method resolves the issue of data limitation
resulting from the availability of a single sample path of financial data by a
novel training scheme. A comprehensive empirical study based on a 17-year-long
testing set demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms a benchmark
method in terms of tracking accuracy and has the potential for earning extra
profit through cash withdraw strategy.

<p class="mathjax">Graph burning is a graph process that models the spread of social contagion.
Initially, all the vertices of a graph G are unburnt. At each step, an unburnt
vertex is put on fire and the fire from burnt vertices of the previous step
spreads to their adjacent unburnt vertices. This process continues till all
vertices are burnt. The burning number $b(G)$ of the graph $G$ is the minimum
number of steps required to burn all the vertices in the graph. The burning
number conjecture by Bonato et al. states that for a connected graph G of order
n, its burning number $b(G) \leq \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$. It is easy to observe
that in order to burn a graph it is enough to burn its spanning tree. Hence it
suffices to prove that for any tree T of order n, its burning number $b(T) \leq
\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ where $T$ is the spanning tree of $G$. It was proved in
2018 that $b(T) \leq \lceil \sqrt{n + n_2 + 1/4} +1/2 \rceil$ for a tree $T$
where $n_2$ is the number of degree $2$ vertices in $T$. In this article, we
give an algorithm to burn a tree and we improve the existing bound using this
algorithm. We prove that $b(T)\leq \lceil \sqrt{n + n_2 + 8}\rceil -1$ which is
an improved bound. Also, under certain restriction of degree $2$ vertices, we
have improved upon the result of Bonato et al.(in 2021). We also provide an
algorithm to burn a binary tree and prove the burning number conjecture for the
same.

<p class="mathjax">Robot-assisted airway intubation application needs high accuracy in locating
targets and organs. Two vital landmarks, nostrils and glottis, can be detected
during the intubation to accommodate the stages of nasal intubation. Automated
landmark detection can provide accurate localization and quantitative
evaluation. The Detection Transformer (DeTR) leads object detectors to a new
paradigm with long-range dependence. However, current DeTR requires long
iterations to converge, and does not perform well in detecting small objects.
This paper proposes a transformer-based landmark detection solution with
deformable DeTR and the semantic-aligned-matching module for detecting
landmarks in robot-assisted intubation. The semantics aligner can effectively
align the semantics of object queries and image features in the same embedding
space using the most discriminative features. To evaluate the performance of
our solution, we utilize a publicly accessible glottis dataset and
automatically annotate a nostril detection dataset. The experimental results
demonstrate our competitive performance in detection accuracy. Our code is
publicly accessible.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid growth of digital pathology in recent years has provided an ideal
opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence-based tools to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical diagnoses. One of the
significant roadblocks to current research is the high level of visual
variability across digital pathology images, causing models to generalise
poorly to unseen data. Stain normalisation aims to standardise the visual
profile of digital pathology images without changing the structural content of
the images. In this chapter, we explore different techniques which have been
used for stain normalisation in digital pathology, with a focus on approaches
which utilise generative adversarial networks (GANs). Typically, GAN-based
methods outperform non-generative approaches but at the cost of much greater
computational requirements. However, it is not clear which method is best for
stain normalisation in general, with different GAN and non-GAN approaches
outperforming each other in different scenarios and according to different
performance metrics. This is an ongoing field of study as researchers aim to
identify a method which efficiently and effectively normalises pathology images
to make AI models more robust and generalisable.

<p class="mathjax">Introducing environmental feedback into evolutionary game theory has led to
the development of eco-evolutionary games, which have gained popularity due to
their ability to capture the intricate interplay between the environment and
decision-making processes. However, current researches in this field focus on
the study to macroscopic evolutionary dynamics in infinite populations. In this
study, we propose a multi-agent computational model based on reinforcement
learning to explore the coupled dynamics between strategies and the environment
in finite populations from a bottom-up perspective. Our findings indicate that
even in environments that favor defectors, high levels of group cooperation can
emerge from self-interested individuals, highlighting the significant role of
the coupling effect between the environment and strategies. Over time, the
higher payoff of defection can be diluted due to environmental degradation,
while cooperation can become the dominant strategy when positively reinforced
by the environment. Remarkably, individuals can accurately detect the
inflection point of the environment solely through rewards, when a reinforcing
positive feedback loop are triggered, resulting in a rapid increase in agents'
rewards and facilitating the establishment and maintenance of group
cooperation. Our research provides a fresh perspective on understanding the
emergence of group cooperation and sheds light on the underlying mechanisms
involving individuals and the environment.

<p class="mathjax">A physics-informed machine learning model, in the form of a multi-output
Gaussian process, is formulated using the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. Given
appropriate datasets, the model can be used to regress the analytical value of
the structure's bending stiffness, interpolate responses, and make
probabilistic inferences on latent physical quantities. The developed model is
applied on a numerically simulated cantilever beam, where the regressed bending
stiffness is evaluated and the influence measurement noise on the prediction
quality is investigated. Further, the regressed probabilistic stiffness
distribution is used in a structural health monitoring context, where the
Mahalanobis distance is employed to reason about the possible location and
extent of damage in the structural system. To validate the developed framework,
an experiment is conducted and measured heterogeneous datasets are used to
update the assumed analytical structural model.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the performance of the spectral method in the estimation
and uncertainty quantification of the unobserved preference scores of compared
entities in a very general and more realistic setup in which the comparison
graph consists of hyper-edges of possible heterogeneous sizes and the number of
comparisons can be as low as one for a given hyper-edge. Such a setting is
pervasive in real applications, circumventing the need to specify the graph
randomness and the restrictive homogeneous sampling assumption imposed in the
commonly-used Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) or Plackett-Luce (PL) models.
Furthermore, in the scenarios when the BTL or PL models are appropriate, we
unravel the relationship between the spectral estimator and the Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE). We discover that a two-step spectral method, where
we apply the optimal weighting estimated from the equal weighting vanilla
spectral method, can achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as the MLE. Given
the asymptotic distributions of the estimated preference scores, we also
introduce a comprehensive framework to carry out both one-sample and two-sample
ranking inferences, applicable to both fixed and random graph settings. It is
noteworthy that it is the first time effective two-sample rank testing methods
are proposed. Finally, we substantiate our findings via comprehensive numerical
simulations and subsequently apply our developed methodologies to perform
statistical inferences on statistics journals and movie rankings.

<p class="mathjax">Recent works have shown that imposing tensor structures on the coefficient
tensor in regression problems can lead to more reliable parameter estimation
and lower sample complexity compared to vector-based methods. This work
investigates a new low-rank tensor model, called Low Separation Rank (LSR), in
Generalized Linear Model (GLM) problems. The LSR model -- which generalizes the
well-known Tucker and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) models, and is a special case of
the Block Tensor Decomposition (BTD) model -- is imposed onto the coefficient
tensor in the GLM model. This work proposes a block coordinate descent
algorithm for parameter estimation in LSR-structured tensor GLMs. Most
importantly, it derives a minimax lower bound on the error threshold on
estimating the coefficient tensor in LSR tensor GLM problems. The minimax bound
is proportional to the intrinsic degrees of freedom in the LSR tensor GLM
problem, suggesting that its sample complexity may be significantly lower than
that of vectorized GLMs. This result can also be specialised to lower bound the
estimation error in CP and Tucker-structured GLMs. The derived bounds are
comparable to tight bounds in the literature for Tucker linear regression, and
the tightness of the minimax lower bound is further assessed numerically.
Finally, numerical experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed LSR tensor model for three regression types (linear, logistic
and Poisson). Experiments on a collection of medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the usefulness of the LSR model over other tensor models (Tucker
and CP) on real, imbalanced data with limited available samples.

<p class="mathjax">Tagged magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI) has been employed for decades to
measure the motion of tissue undergoing deformation. However,
registration-based motion estimation from tMRI is difficult due to the periodic
patterns in these images, particularly when the motion is large. With a larger
motion the registration approach gets trapped in a local optima, leading to
motion estimation errors. We introduce a novel "momenta, shooting, and
correction" framework for Lagrangian motion estimation in the presence of
repetitive patterns and large motion. This framework, grounded in Lie algebra
and Lie group principles, accumulates momenta in the tangent vector space and
employs exponential mapping in the diffeomorphic space for rapid approximation
towards true optima, circumventing local optima. A subsequent correction step
ensures convergence to true optima. The results on a 2D synthetic dataset and a
real 3D tMRI dataset demonstrate our method's efficiency in estimating
accurate, dense, and diffeomorphic 2D/3D motion fields amidst large motion and
repetitive patterns.

<p class="mathjax">As a label-free imaging technique, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides
optical path length information of transparent specimens for various
applications in biology, materials science, and engineering. Multispectral QPI
measures quantitative phase information across multiple spectral bands,
permitting the examination of wavelength-specific phase and dispersion
characteristics of samples. Here, we present the design of a diffractive
processor that can all-optically perform multispectral quantitative phase
imaging of transparent phase-only objects in a snapshot. Our design utilizes
spatially engineered diffractive layers, optimized through deep learning, to
encode the phase profile of the input object at a predetermined set of
wavelengths into spatial intensity variations at the output plane, allowing
multispectral QPI using a monochrome focal plane array. Through numerical
simulations, we demonstrate diffractive multispectral processors to
simultaneously perform quantitative phase imaging at 9 and 16 target spectral
bands in the visible spectrum. These diffractive multispectral processors
maintain uniform performance across all the wavelength channels, revealing a
decent QPI performance at each target wavelength. The generalization of these
diffractive processor designs is validated through numerical tests on unseen
objects, including thin Pap smear images. Due to its all-optical processing
capability using passive dielectric diffractive materials, this diffractive
multispectral QPI processor offers a compact and power-efficient solution for
high-throughput quantitative phase microscopy and spectroscopy. This framework
can operate at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and be used for
a wide range of phase imaging and sensing applications.

<p class="mathjax">Although deep learning (DL) methods are powerful for solving inverse
problems, their reliance on high-quality training data is a major hurdle. This
is significant in high-dimensional (dynamic/volumetric) magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), where acquisition of high-resolution fully sampled k-space data
is impractical. We introduce a novel mathematical framework, dubbed k-band,
that enables training DL models using only partial, limited-resolution k-space
data. Specifically, we introduce training with stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) over k-space subsets. In each training iteration, rather than using the
fully sampled k-space for computing gradients, we use only a small k-space
portion. This concept is compatible with different sampling strategies; here we
demonstrate the method for k-space "bands", which have limited resolution in
one dimension and can hence be acquired rapidly. We prove analytically that our
method stochastically approximates the gradients computed in a fully-supervised
setup, when two simple conditions are met: (i) the limited-resolution axis is
chosen randomly-uniformly for every new scan, hence k-space is fully covered
across the entire training set, and (ii) the loss function is weighed with a
mask, derived here analytically, which facilitates accurate reconstruction of
high-resolution details. Numerical experiments with raw MRI data indicate that
k-band outperforms two other methods trained on limited-resolution data and
performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on
high-resolution data. k-band hence obtains SoTA performance, with the advantage
of training using only limited-resolution data. This work hence introduces a
practical, easy-to-implement, self-supervised training framework, which
involves fast acquisition and self-supervised reconstruction and offers
theoretical guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">Skin lesion segmentation plays a critical role in the early detection and
accurate diagnosis of dermatological conditions. Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently gained attention for their
exceptional image-generation capabilities. Building on these advancements, we
propose DermoSegDiff, a novel framework for skin lesion segmentation that
incorporates boundary information during the learning process. Our approach
introduces a novel loss function that prioritizes the boundaries during
training, gradually reducing the significance of other regions. We also
introduce a novel U-Net-based denoising network that proficiently integrates
noise and semantic information inside the network. Experimental results on
multiple skin segmentation datasets demonstrate the superiority of DermoSegDiff
over existing CNN, transformer, and diffusion-based approaches, showcasing its
effectiveness and generalization in various scenarios. The implementation is
publicly accessible on

<p class="mathjax">In supervised learning, it is quite frequent to be confronted with real
imbalanced datasets. This situation leads to a learning difficulty for standard
algorithms. Research and solutions in imbalanced learning have mainly focused
on classification tasks. Despite its importance, very few solutions exist for
imbalanced regression. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation procedure,
the GOLIATH algorithm, based on kernel density estimates which can be used in
classification and regression. This general approach encompasses two large
families of synthetic oversampling: those based on perturbations, such as
Gaussian Noise, and those based on interpolations, such as SMOTE. It also
provides an explicit form of these machine learning algorithms and an
expression of their conditional densities, in particular for SMOTE. New
synthetic data generators are deduced. We apply GOLIATH in imbalanced
regression combining such generator procedures with a wild-bootstrap resampling
technique for the target values. We evaluate the performance of the GOLIATH
algorithm in imbalanced regression situations. We empirically evaluate and
compare our approach and demonstrate significant improvement over existing
state-of-the-art techniques.

<p class="mathjax">We show that for any permutation $\pi$ there exists an integer $k_{\pi}$ such
that every permutation avoiding $\pi$ as a pattern is a product of at most
$k_{\pi}$ separable permutations. In other words, every strict class $\mathcal
C$ of permutations is contained in a bounded power of the class of separable
permutations. This factorisation can be computed in linear time, for any fixed
$\pi$. The central tool for our result is a notion of width of permutations,
introduced by Guillemot and Marx [SODA '14] to efficiently detect patterns, and
later generalised to graphs and matrices under the name of twin-width.
Specifically, our factorisation is inspired by the decomposition used in the
recent result that graphs with bounded twin-width are polynomially
$\chi$-bounded. As an application, we show that there is a fixed class
$\mathcal C$ of graphs of bounded twin-width such that every class of bounded
twin-width is a first-order transduction of $\mathcal C$.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate identification and quantification of unruptured intracranial
aneurysms (UIAs) are essential for the risk assessment and treatment decisions
of this cerebrovascular disorder. Current assessment based on 2D manual
measures of aneurysms on 3D magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is sub-optimal
and time-consuming. Automatic 3D measures can significantly benefit the
clinical workflow and treatment outcomes. However, one major issue in medical
image segmentation is the need for large well-annotated data, which can be
expensive to obtain. Techniques that mitigate the requirement, such as weakly
supervised learning with coarse labels are highly desirable. In this paper, we
leverage coarse labels of UIAs from time-of-flight MRAs to obtain refined UIAs
segmentation using a novel 3D focal modulation UNet, called FocalSegNet and
conditional random field (CRF) postprocessing, with a Dice score of 0.68 and
95% Hausdorff distance of 0.95 mm. We evaluated the performance of the proposed
algorithms against the state-of-the-art 3D UNet and Swin-UNETR, and
demonstrated the superiority of the proposed FocalSegNet and the benefit of
focal modulation for the task.

<p class="mathjax">Early detection and localization of pancreatic cancer can increase the 5-year
survival rate for patients from 8.5% to 20%. Artificial intelligence (AI) can
potentially assist radiologists in detecting pancreatic tumors at an early
stage. Training AI models require a vast number of annotated examples, but the
availability of CT scans obtaining early-stage tumors is constrained. This is
because early-stage tumors may not cause any symptoms, which can delay
detection, and the tumors are relatively small and may be almost invisible to
human eyes on CT scans. To address this issue, we develop a tumor synthesis
method that can synthesize enormous examples of small pancreatic tumors in the
healthy pancreas without the need for manual annotation. Our experiments
demonstrate that the overall detection rate of pancreatic tumors, measured by
Sensitivity and Specificity, achieved by AI trained on synthetic tumors is
comparable to that of real tumors. More importantly, our method shows a much
higher detection rate for small tumors. We further investigate the per-voxel
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumors if AI is trained on a combination
of CT scans with synthetic tumors and CT scans with annotated large tumors at
an advanced stage. Finally, we show that synthetic tumors improve AI
generalizability in tumor detection and localization when processing CT scans
from different hospitals. Overall, our proposed tumor synthesis method has
immense potential to improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer, leading
to better patient outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">According to various estimates, brown dwarfs (BD) should account for up to 25
percent of all objects in the Galaxy. However, few of them are discovered and
well-studied, both individually and as a population. Homogeneous and complete
samples of brown dwarfs are needed for these kinds of studies. Due to their
weakness, spectral studies of brown dwarfs are rather laborious. For this
reason, creating a significant reliable sample of brown dwarfs, confirmed by
spectroscopic observations, seems unattainable at the moment. Numerous attempts
have been made to search for and create a set of brown dwarfs using their
colours as a decision rule applied to a vast amount of survey data. In this
work, we use machine learning methods such as Random Forest Classifier,
XGBoost, SVM Classifier and TabNet on PanStarrs DR1, 2MASS and WISE data to
distinguish L and T brown dwarfs from objects of other spectral and luminosity
classes. The explanation of the models is discussed. We also compare our models
with classical decision rules, proving their efficiency and relevance.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence is constantly evolving and can provide effective help
in all aspects of people's lives. The experiment is mainly to study the use of
artificial intelligence in the field of medicine. The purpose of this
experiment was to compare which of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 models was
better at detecting histopathological images of the breast downloaded at
Kaggle. When the doctor looks at the pathological image, there may be errors
that lead to errors in judgment, and the observation speed is slow. Rational
use of artificial intelligence can effectively reduce the error of doctor
diagnosis in breast cancer judgment and speed up doctor diagnosis. The dataset
was downloaded from Kaggle and then normalized. The basic principle of the
experiment is to let the neural network model learn the downloaded data set.
Then find the pattern and be able to judge on your own whether breast tissue is
cancer. In the dataset, benign tumor pictures and malignant tumor pictures have
been classified, of which 198738 are benign tumor pictures and 78, 786 are
malignant tumor pictures. After calling MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2, the
dataset is trained separately, the training accuracy and validation accuracy
rate are obtained, and the image is drawn. It can be observed that MobileNetV1
has better validation accuracy and overfit during MobileNetV2 training. From
the experimental results, it can be seen that in the case of processing this
dataset, MobileNetV1 is much better than MobileNetV2.

<p class="mathjax">Ocean modeling is a powerful tool for simulating the physical, chemical, and
biological processes of the ocean, which is the foundation for marine science
research and operational oceanography. Modern numerical ocean modeling mainly
consists of governing equations and numerical algorithms. Nonlinear
instability, computational expense, low reusability efficiency and high
coupling costs have gradually become the main bottlenecks for the further
development of numerical ocean modeling. Recently, artificial
intelligence-based modeling in scientific computing has shown revolutionary
potential for digital twins and scientific simulations, but the bottlenecks of
numerical ocean modeling have not been further solved. Here, we present
AI-GOMS, a large AI-driven global ocean modeling system, for accurate and
efficient global ocean daily prediction. AI-GOMS consists of a backbone model
with the Fourier-based Masked Autoencoder structure for basic ocean variable
prediction and lightweight fine-tuning models incorporating regional
downscaling, wave decoding, and biochemistry coupling modules. AI-GOMS has
achieved the best performance in 30 days of prediction for the global ocean
basic variables with 15 depth layers at 1/4{\deg} spatial resolution. Beyond
the good performance in statistical metrics, AI-GOMS realizes the simulation of
mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio region at 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution and
ocean stratification in the tropical Pacific Ocean. AI-GOMS provides a new
backbone-downstream paradigm for Earth system modeling, which makes the system
transferable, scalable and reusable.

<p class="mathjax">Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) can potentially solve practical
problems using contemporary Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.
VQAs find near-optimal solutions in the presence of qubit errors by classically
optimizing a loss function computed by parameterized quantum circuits. However,
developing and testing VQAs is challenging due to the limited availability of
quantum hardware, their high error rates, and the significant overhead of
classical simulations. Furthermore, VQA researchers must pick the right
initialization for circuit parameters, utilize suitable classical optimizer
configurations, and deploy appropriate error mitigation methods. Unfortunately,
these tasks are done in an ad-hoc manner today, as there are no software tools
to configure and tune the VQA hyperparameters.
<br />In this paper, we present OSCAR (cOmpressed Sensing based Cost lAndscape
Reconstruction) to help configure: 1) correct initialization, 2) noise
mitigation techniques, and 3) classical optimizers to maximize the quality of
the solution on NISQ hardware. OSCAR enables efficient debugging and
performance tuning by providing users with the loss function landscape without
running thousands of quantum circuits as required by the grid search. Using
OSCAR, we can accurately reconstruct the complete cost landscape with up to
100X speedup. Furthermore, OSCAR can compute an optimizer function query in an
instant by interpolating a computed landscape, thus enabling the trial run of a
VQA configuration with considerably reduced overhead.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we investigate the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) when training a single-neuron autoencoder with linear or ReLU activation
on orthogonal data. We show that for this non-convex problem, randomly
initialized SGD with a constant step size successfully finds a global minimum
for any batch size choice. However, the particular global minimum found depends
upon the batch size. In the full-batch setting, we show that the solution is
dense (i.e., not sparse) and is highly aligned with its initialized direction,
showing that relatively little feature learning occurs. On the other hand, for
any batch size strictly smaller than the number of samples, SGD finds a global
minimum which is sparse and nearly orthogonal to its initialization, showing
that the randomness of stochastic gradients induces a qualitatively different
type of "feature selection" in this setting. Moreover, if we measure the
sharpness of the minimum by the trace of the Hessian, the minima found with
full batch gradient descent are flatter than those found with strictly smaller
batch sizes, in contrast to previous works which suggest that large batches
lead to sharper minima. To prove convergence of SGD with a constant step size,
we introduce a powerful tool from the theory of non-homogeneous random walks
which may be of independent interest.

<p class="mathjax">Music is a complex socio-cultural construct, which fascinates researchers in
diverse fields, as well as the general public. Understanding the historical
development of music may help us understand perceptual and cognition, while
also yielding insight in the processes of cultural transmission, creativity,
and innovation. Here, we present a study of musical features related to
harmony, and we document how they evolved over 400 years in western classical
music. We developed a variant of the center of effect algorithm to call the
most likely for a given set of notes, to represent a musical piece as a
sequence of local keys computed measure by measure. We develop measures to
quantify key uncertainty, and diversity and novelty in key transitions. We
provide specific examples to demonstrate the features represented by these
concepts, and we argue how they are related to harmonic complexity and can be
used to study the evolution of harmony. We confirm several observations and
trends previously reported by musicologists and scientists, with some
discrepancies during the Classical period. We report a decline in innovation in
harmonic transitions in the early classical period followed by a steep increase
in the late classical; and we give an explanation for this finding that is
consistent with accounts by music theorists. Finally, we discuss the
limitations of this approach for cross-cultural studies and the need for more
expressive but still tractable representations of musical scores, as well as a
large and reliable musical corpus, for future study.

<p class="mathjax">Prior studies in the automatic classification of voice quality have mainly
studied the use of the acoustic speech signal as input. Recently, a few studies
have been carried out by jointly using both speech and neck surface
accelerometer (NSA) signals as inputs, and by extracting MFCCs and glottal
source features. This study examines simultaneously-recorded speech and NSA
signals in the classification of voice quality (breathy, modal, and pressed)
using features derived from three self-supervised pre-trained models
(wav2vec2-BASE, wav2vec2-LARGE, and HuBERT) and using a SVM as well as CNNs as
classifiers. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the pre-trained models is
compared in feature extraction between glottal source waveforms and raw signal
waveforms for both speech and NSA inputs. Using two signal processing methods
(quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering and zero frequency
filtering (ZFF)), glottal source waveforms are estimated from both speech and
NSA signals. The study has three main goals: (1) to study whether features
derived from pre-trained models improve classification accuracy compared to
conventional features (spectrogram, mel-spectrogram, MFCCs, i-vector, and
x-vector), (2) to investigate which of the two modalities (speech vs. NSA) is
more effective in the classification task with pre-trained model-based
features, and (3) to evaluate whether the deep learning-based CNN classifier
can enhance the classification accuracy in comparison to the SVM classifier.
The results revealed that the use of the NSA input showed better classification
performance compared to the speech signal. Between the features, the
pre-trained model-based features showed better classification accuracies, both
for speech and NSA inputs compared to the conventional features. It was also
found that the HuBERT features performed better than the wav2vec2-BASE and
wav2vec2-LARGE features.

<p class="mathjax">To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this
paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for
power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and
emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the
C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as
well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon
flow. In particular, this paper establishes the invertibility of the carbon
flow matrix and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the
issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF
model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon
accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated
into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and
effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.

<p class="mathjax">A sequential fronthaul network, referred to as radio stripes, is a promising
fronthaul topology of cell-free MIMO systems. In this setup, a single cable
suffices to connect access points (APs) to a central processor (CP). Thus,
radio stripes are more effective than conventional star fronthaul topology
which requires dedicated cables for each of APs. Most of works on radio stripes
focused on the uplink communication or downlink energy transfer. This work
tackles the design of the downlink data transmission for the first time. The CP
sends compressed information of linearly precoded signals to the APs on
fronthaul. Due to the serial transfer on radio stripes, each AP has an access
to all the compressed blocks which pass through it. Thus, an advanced
compression technique, called Wyner-Ziv (WZ) compression, can be applied in
which each AP decompresses all the received blocks to exploit them for the
reconstruction of its desired precoded signal as side information. The problem
of maximizing the sum-rate is tackled under the standard point-to-point (P2P)
and WZ compression strategies. Numerical results validate the performance gains
of the proposed scheme.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a high-rate scheme for discretely-modulated continuous-variable
quantum key distribution (DM CVQKD) using quantum machine learning
technologies, which divides the whole CVQKD system into three parts, i.e., the
initialization part that is used for training and estimating quantum
classifier, the prediction part that is used for generating highly correlated
raw keys, and the data-postprocessing part that generates the final secret key
string shared by Alice and Bob. To this end, a low-complexity quantum k-nearest
neighbor (QkNN) classifier is designed for predicting the lossy
discretely-modulated coherent states (DMCSs) at Bob's side. The performance of
the proposed QkNN-based CVQKD especially in terms of machine learning metrics
and complexity is analyzed, and its theoretical security is proved by using
semi-definite program (SDP) method. Numerical simulation shows that the secret
key rate of our proposed scheme is explicitly superior to the existing DM CVQKD
protocols, and it can be further enhanced with the increase of modulation
variance.

<p class="mathjax">The ensemble data assimilation of computational fluid dynamics simulations
based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the local ensemble transform
Kalman filter (LETKF) is implemented and optimized on a GPU supercomputer based
on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. To connect the LBM and LETKF parts, data transpose
communication is optimized by overlapping computation, file I/O, and
communication based on data dependency in each LETKF kernel. In two dimensional
forced isotropic turbulence simulations with the ensemble size of $M=64$ and
the number of grid points of $N_x=128^2$, the optimized implementation achieved
$\times3.80$ speedup from the naive implementation, in which the LETKF part is
not parallelized. The main computing kernel of the local problem is the
eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of $M\times M$ real symmetric dense matrices,
which is computed by a newly developed batched EVD in $\verb|EigenG|$. The
batched EVD in $\verb|EigenG|$ outperforms that in $\verb|cuSOLVER|$, and

<p class="mathjax">Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving is a fundamental problem in computer
science. Finding efficient algorithms for SAT solving has broad implications in
many areas of computer science and beyond. Quantum SAT solvers have been
proposed in the literature based on Grover's algorithm. Although existing
quantum SAT solvers can consider all possible inputs at once, they evaluate
each clause in the formula one by one sequentially, making the time complexity
O(m) -- linear to the number of clauses m -- per Grover iteration. In this
work, we develop a parallel quantum SAT solver, which reduces the time
complexity in each iteration from linear time O(m) to constant time O(1) by
utilising extra entangled qubits. To further improve the scalability of our
solution in case of extremely large problems, we develop a distributed version
of the proposed parallel SAT solver based on quantum teleportation such that
the total qubits required are shared and distributed among a set of quantum
computers (nodes), and the quantum SAT solving is accomplished collaboratively
by all the nodes. We have proved the correctness of our approaches and
demonstrated them in simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Cone Beam CT (CBCT) plays a crucial role in Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART)
by accurately providing radiation treatment when organ anatomy changes occur.
However, CBCT images suffer from scatter noise and artifacts, making relying
solely on CBCT for precise dose calculation and accurate tissue localization
challenging. Therefore, there is a need to improve CBCT image quality and
Hounsfield Unit (HU) accuracy while preserving anatomical structures. To
enhance the role and application value of CBCT in ART, we propose an
energy-guided diffusion model (EGDiff) and conduct experiments on a chest tumor
dataset to generate synthetic CT (sCT) from CBCT. The experimental results
demonstrate impressive performance with an average absolute error of
26.87$\pm$6.14 HU, a structural similarity index measurement of 0.850$\pm$0.03,
a peak signal-to-noise ratio of the sCT of 19.83$\pm$1.39 dB, and a normalized
cross-correlation of the sCT of 0.874$\pm$0.04. These results indicate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised synthesis methods in accuracy

<p class="mathjax">Nucleus image segmentation is a crucial step in the analysis, pathological
diagnosis, and classification, which heavily relies on the quality of nucleus
segmentation. However, the complexity of issues such as variations in nucleus
size, blurred nucleus contours, uneven staining, cell clustering, and
overlapping cells poses significant challenges. Current methods for nucleus
segmentation primarily rely on nuclear morphology or contour-based approaches.
Nuclear morphology-based methods exhibit limited generalization ability and
struggle to effectively predict irregular-shaped nuclei, while contour-based
extraction methods face challenges in accurately segmenting overlapping nuclei.
To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dual-branch network using
hybrid attention based residual U-blocks for nucleus instance segmentation. The
network simultaneously predicts target information and target contours.
Additionally, we introduce a post-processing method that combines the target
information and target contours to distinguish overlapping nuclei and generate
an instance segmentation image. Within the network, we propose a context fusion
block (CF-block) that effectively extracts and merges contextual information
from the network. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess
the performance of our method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches on
the BNS, MoNuSeg, CoNSeg, and CPM-17 datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computers are becoming practical for computing numerous applications.
However, simulating quantum computing on classical computers is still demanding
yet useful because current quantum computers are limited because of computer
resources, hardware limits, instability, and noises. Improving quantum
computing simulation performance in classical computers will contribute to the
development of quantum computers and their algorithms. Quantum computing
simulations on classical computers require long performance times, especially
for quantum circuits with a large number of qubits or when simulating a large
number of shots for noise simulations or circuits with intermediate measures.
Graphical processing units (GPU) are suitable to accelerate quantum computer
simulations by exploiting their computational power and high bandwidth memory
and they have a large advantage in simulating relatively larger qubits
circuits. However, GPUs are inefficient at simulating multi-shots runs with
noises because the randomness prevents highly parallelization. In addition,
GPUs have a disadvantage in simulating circuits with a small number of qubits
because of the large overheads in GPU kernel execution. In this paper, we
introduce optimization techniques for multi-shot simulations on GPUs. We gather
multiple shots of simulations into a single GPU kernel execution to reduce
overheads by scheduling randomness caused by noises. In addition, we introduce
shot-branching that reduces calculations and memory usage for multi-shot
simulations. By using these techniques, we speed up x10 from previous
implementations.

<p class="mathjax">A $c$-labeling $\phi: V(G) \rightarrow \{1, 2, \hdots, c \}$ of graph $G$ is
distinguishing if, for every non-trivial automorphism $\pi$ of $G$, there is
some vertex $v$ so that $\phi(v) \neq \phi(\pi(v))$. The distinguishing number
of $G$, $D(G)$, is the smallest $c$ such that $G$ has a distinguishing
$c$-labeling.
<br />We consider a compact version of Tyshkevich's graph decomposition theorem
where trivial components are maximally combined to form a complete graph or a
graph of isolated vertices. Suppose the compact canonical decomposition of $G$
is $G_{k} \circ G_{k-1} \circ \cdots \circ G_1 \circ G_0$. We prove that $\phi$
is a distinguishing labeling of $G$ if and only if $\phi$ is a distinguishing
labeling of $G_i$ when restricted to $V(G_i)$ for $i = 0, \hdots, k$. Thus,
$D(G) = \max \{D(G_i), i = 0, \hdots, k \}$. We then present an algorithm that
computes the distinguishing number of a unigraph in linear time.

the industry for measuring coded video quality. In this study, we propose an
auditory-inspired frontend in existing VMAF for creating videos of reference
and coded spectrograms, and extended VMAF for measuring coded audio quality. We
name our system AudioVMAF. We demonstrate that image replication is capable of
further enhancing prediction accuracy, especially when band-limited anchors are
present. The proposed method significantly outperforms all existing visual
quality features repurposed for audio, and even demonstrates a significant
overall improvement of 7.8% and 2.0% of Pearson and Spearman rank correlation

<p class="mathjax">We study Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandit settings with large
action spaces. The benchmark estimators suffer from severe bias and variance
tradeoffs. Parametric approaches suffer from bias due to difficulty specifying
the correct model, whereas ones with importance weight suffer from variance. To
overcome these limitations, Marginalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (MIPS) was
proposed to mitigate the estimator's variance via embeddings of an action. To
make the estimator more accurate, we propose the doubly robust estimator of
MIPS called the Marginalized Doubly Robust (MDR) estimator. Theoretical
analysis shows that the proposed estimator is unbiased under weaker assumptions
than MIPS while maintaining variance reduction against IPS, which was the main
advantage of MIPS. The empirical experiment verifies the supremacy of MDR
against existing estimators.

<p class="mathjax">Blow-up solutions to a heat equation with spatial periodicity and a quadratic
nonlinearity are studied through asymptotic analyses and a variety of numerical
methods. The focus is on the dynamics of the singularities in the complexified
space domain. Blow up in finite time is caused by these singularities
eventually reaching the real axis. The analysis provides a distinction between
small and large nonlinear effects, as well as insight into the various time
scales on which blow up is approached. It is shown that an ordinary
differential equation with quadratic nonlinearity plays a central role in the
asymptotic analysis. This equation is studied in detail, including its
numerical computation on multiple Riemann sheets, and the far-field solutions
are shown to be given at leading order by a Weierstrass elliptic function.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the traditional feature engineering process for training
machine learning models is being automated by the feature extraction layers
integrated in deep learning architectures. In wireless networks, many studies
were conducted in automatic learning of feature representations for
domain-related challenges. However, most of the existing works assume some
supervision along the learning process by using labels to optimize the model.
In this paper, we investigate an approach to learning feature representations
for wireless transmission clustering in a completely unsupervised manner, i.e.
requiring no labels in the process. We propose a model based on convolutional
neural networks that automatically learns a reduced dimensionality
representation of the input data with 99.3% less components compared to a
baseline principal component analysis (PCA). We show that the automatic
representation learning is able to extract fine-grained clusters containing the
shapes of the wireless transmission bursts, while the baseline enables only
general separability of the data based on the background noise.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a numerical algorithm for computing approximately optimal
solutions of the matching for teams problem. Our algorithm is efficient for
problems involving a large number of agent categories and allows for the
measures describing the agent types to be non-discrete. Specifically, we
parametrize the so-called transfer functions and develop a parametric version
of the dual formulation. Our algorithm tackles this parametric formulation and
produces feasible and approximately optimal solutions for the primal and dual
formulations of the matching for teams problem. These solutions also yield
upper and lower bounds for the optimal value, and the difference between the
upper and lower bounds provides a direct sub-optimality estimate of the
computed solutions. Moreover, we are able to control a theoretical upper bound
on the sub-optimality to be arbitrarily close to 0 under mild conditions. We
subsequently prove that the approximate primal and dual solutions converge when
the sub-optimality goes to 0 and their limits constitute a true matching
equilibrium. Thus, the outputs of our algorithm are regarded as an approximate
matching equilibrium. We also analyze the theoretical computational complexity
of our parametric formulation as well as the sparsity of the resulting
approximate matching equilibrium. Through numerical experiments, we showcase
that the proposed algorithm can produce high-quality approximate matching
equilibria and is applicable to versatile settings, including a
high-dimensional setting involving 100 agent categories.

process of a rodent exploring a novel environment, the relations between

<p class="mathjax">Nonparametric two-sample tests such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) are
often used to detect differences between two distributions in machine learning
applications. However, the majority of existing literature assumes that
error-free samples from the two distributions of interest are available.We
relax this assumption and study the estimation of the MMD under
$\epsilon$-contamination, where a possibly non-random $\epsilon$ proportion of
one distribution is erroneously grouped with the other. We show that under
$\epsilon$-contamination, the typical estimate of the MMD is unreliable.
Instead, we study partial identification of the MMD, and characterize sharp
upper and lower bounds that contain the true, unknown MMD. We propose a method
to estimate these bounds, and show that it gives estimates that converge to the
sharpest possible bounds on the MMD as sample size increases, with a
convergence rate that is faster than alternative approaches. Using three
datasets, we empirically validate that our approach is superior to the
alternatives: it gives tight bounds with a low false coverage rate.

<p class="mathjax">Lengthy evaluation times are common in many optimization problems such as
direct policy search tasks, especially when they involve conducting evaluations
in the physical world, e.g. in robotics applications. Often, when evaluating a
solution over a fixed time period, it becomes clear that the objective value
will not increase with additional computation time (for example, when a
two-wheeled robot continuously spins on the spot). In such cases, it makes
sense to stop the evaluation early to save computation time. However, most
approaches to stop the evaluation are problem-specific and need to be
specifically designed for the task at hand. Therefore, we propose an early
stopping method for direct policy search. The proposed method only looks at the
objective value at each time step and requires no problem-specific knowledge.
<br />We test the introduced stopping criterion in five direct policy search
environments drawn from games, robotics, and classic control domains, and show
that it can save up to 75% of the computation time. We also compare it with
problem-specific stopping criteria and demonstrate that it performs comparably
while being more generally applicable.

diagnosis and treatment. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing
small vessels and handling datasets that are partially or ambiguously
annotated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive semi-supervised approach to
address these challenges. Our approach incorporates innovative techniques
including progressive semi-supervised learning, adaptative training strategy,
and boundary enhancement. Experimental results on 3DRA datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method in terms of mesh-based segmentation metrics. By
leveraging the partially and ambiguously labeled data, which only annotates the
main vessels, our method achieves impressive segmentation performance on
mislabeled fine vessels, showcasing its potential for clinical applications.

<p class="mathjax">With a growing interest in outer space, space robots have become a focus of
exploration. To coordinate them for unmanned space exploration, we propose to
use the "mother-daughter structure". In this setup, the mother spacecraft
orbits the planet, while daughter probes are distributed across the surface.
The mother spacecraft senses the environment, computes control commands and
distributes them to daughter probes to take actions. They synergistically form
sensing-communication-computing-control ($\mathbf{SC^3}$) loops, which are
indivisible. We thereby optimize the spacecraft-probe downlink within
$\mathbf{SC^3}$ loops to minimize the sum linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
cost. The optimization variables are block length and transmit power. On
account of the cycle time constraint, the spacecraft-probe downlink operates in
the finite block length (FBL) regime. To solve the nonlinear mixed-integer
problem, we first identify the optimal block length and then transform the
power allocation problem into a tractable convex one. Additionally, we derive
the approximate closed-form solutions for the proposed scheme and also for the
max-sum rate scheme and max-min rate scheme. On this basis, we reveal their
different power allocation principles. Moreover, we find that for
time-insensitive control tasks, the proposed scheme demonstrates equivalence to
the max-min rate scheme. These findings are verified through simulations.

<p class="mathjax">As researchers strive to narrow the gap between machine intelligence and
human through the development of artificial intelligence technologies, it is
imperative that we recognize the critical importance of trustworthiness in
open-world, which has become ubiquitous in all aspects of daily life for
everyone. However, several challenges may create a crisis of trust in current
artificial intelligence systems that need to be bridged: 1) Insufficient
explanation of predictive results; 2) Inadequate generalization for learning
models; 3) Poor adaptability to uncertain environments. Consequently, we
explore a neural program to bridge trustworthiness and open-world learning,
extending from single-modal to multi-modal scenarios for readers. 1) To enhance
design-level interpretability, we first customize trustworthy networks with
specific physical meanings; 2) We then design environmental well-being
task-interfaces via flexible learning regularizers for improving the
generalization of trustworthy learning; 3) We propose to increase the
robustness of trustworthy learning by integrating open-world recognition losses
with agent mechanisms. Eventually, we enhance various trustworthy properties
through the establishment of design-level explainability, environmental
well-being task-interfaces and open-world recognition programs. These designed
open-world protocols are applicable across a wide range of surroundings, under
open-world multimedia recognition scenarios with significant performance
improvements observed.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we first develop a tractable mathematical model of the handoff
(HO)-aware rate outage experienced by a typical connected and autonomous
vehicle (CAV) in a given THz vehicular network. The derived model captures the
impact of line-of-sight (LOS) Nakagami-m fading channels, interference, and
molecular absorption effects. We first derive the statistics of the
interference-plus-molecular absorption noise ratio and demonstrate that it can
be approximated by Gamma distribution using Welch-Satterthwaite approximation.
Then, we show that the distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-molecular
absorption noise ratio (SINR) follows a generalized Beta prime distribution.
Based on this, a closed-form HO-aware rate outage expression is derived.
Finally, we formulate and solve a CAVs' traffic flow maximization problem to
optimize the base-stations (BSs) density and speed of CAVs with collision
avoidance, rate outage, and CAVs' minimum traffic flow constraint. The CAVs'
traffic flow is modeled using Log-Normal distribution. Our numerical results
validate the accuracy of the derived expressions using Monte-Carlo simulations
and discuss useful insights related to optimal BS density and CAVs' speed as a
function of crash intensity level, THz molecular absorption effects, minimum
road-traffic flow and rate requirements, and maximum speed and rate outage
limits.

<p class="mathjax">Multichannel active noise control (MCANC) is widely utilized to achieve
significant noise cancellation area in the complicated acoustic field.
Meanwhile, the filter-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm gradually becomes
the benchmark solution for the implementation of MCANC due to its low
computational complexity. However, its slow convergence speed more or less
undermines the performance of dealing with quickly varying disturbances, such
as piling noise. Furthermore, the noise power variation also deteriorates the
robustness of the algorithm when it adopts the fixed step size. To solve these
issues, we integrated the normalized multichannel FxLMS with the momentum
method, which hence, effectively avoids the interference of the primary noise
power and accelerates the convergence of the algorithm. To validate its
effectiveness, we deployed this algorithm in a multichannel noise control
window to control the real machine noise.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models are a powerful method for generating approximate samples
from high-dimensional data distributions. Several recent results have provided
polynomial bounds on the convergence rate of such models, assuming
$L^2$-accurate score estimators. However, up until now the best known such
bounds were either superlinear in the data dimension or required strong
smoothness assumptions. We provide the first convergence bounds which are
linear in the data dimension (up to logarithmic factors) assuming only finite
second moments of the data distribution. We show that diffusion models require
at most $\tilde O(\frac{d \log^2(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$ steps to
approximate an arbitrary data distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ corrupted with
Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ to within $\varepsilon^2$ in
Kullback--Leibler divergence. Our proof builds on the Girsanov-based methods of
previous works. We introduce a refined treatment of the error arising from the
discretization of the reverse SDE, which is based on tools from stochastic
localization.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic sequential quadratic optimization (SQP) methods for solving
continuous optimization problems with nonlinear equality constraints have
attracted attention recently, such as for solving large-scale data-fitting
problems subject to nonconvex constraints. However, for a recently proposed
subclass of such methods that is built on the popular stochastic-gradient
methodology from the unconstrained setting, convergence guarantees have been
limited to the asymptotic convergence of the expected value of a stationarity
measure to zero. This is in contrast to the unconstrained setting in which
almost-sure convergence guarantees (of the gradient of the objective to zero)
can be proved for stochastic-gradient-based methods. In this paper, new
almost-sure convergence guarantees for the primal iterates, Lagrange
multipliers, and stationarity measures generated by a stochastic SQP algorithm
in this subclass of methods are proved. It is shown that the error in the
Lagrange multipliers can be bounded by the distance of the primal iterate to a
primal stationary point plus the error in the latest stochastic gradient
estimate. It is further shown that, subject to certain assumptions, this latter
error can be made to vanish by employing a running average of the Lagrange
multipliers that are computed during the run of the algorithm. The results of
numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the proved theoretical
guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">We characterize the equilibrium properties of a model of $y$ coupled binary
perceptrons in the teacher-student scenario, subject to a suitable learning
rule, with an explicit ferromagnetic coupling proportional to the Hamming
distance between the students' weights. In contrast to recent works, we analyze
a more general setting in which a thermal noise is present that affects the
generalization performance of each student. Specifically, in the presence of a
nonzero temperature, which assigns nonzero probability to configurations that
misclassify samples with respect to the teacher's prescription, we find that
the coupling of replicas leads to a shift of the phase diagram to smaller
values of $\alpha$: This suggests that the free energy landscape gets smoother
around the solution with good generalization (i.e., the teacher) at a fixed
fraction of reviewed examples, which allows local update algorithms such as
Simulated Annealing to reach the solution before the dynamics gets frozen.
Finally, from a learning perspective, these results suggest that more students
(in this case, with the same amount of data) are able to learn the same rule
when coupled together with a smaller amount of data.
