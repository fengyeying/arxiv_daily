<p class="mathjax">Text-to-image models suffer from various safety issues that may limit their
suitability for deployment. Previous methods have separately addressed
individual issues of bias, copyright, and offensive content in text-to-image
models. However, in the real world, all of these issues appear simultaneously
in the same model. We present a method that tackles all issues with a single
approach. Our method, Unified Concept Editing (UCE), edits the model without
training using a closed-form solution, and scales seamlessly to concurrent
edits on text-conditional diffusion models. We demonstrate scalable
simultaneous debiasing, style erasure, and content moderation by editing
text-to-image projections, and we present extensive experiments demonstrating
improved efficacy and scalability over prior work. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Aquaculture is a thriving food-producing sector producing over half of the
global fish consumption. However, these aquafarms pose significant challenges
such as biofouling, vegetation, and holes within their net pens and have a
profound effect on the efficiency and sustainability of fish production.
Currently, divers and/or remotely operated vehicles are deployed for inspecting
and maintaining aquafarms; this approach is expensive and requires highly
skilled human operators. This work aims to develop a robotic-based automatic
net defect detection system for aquaculture net pens oriented to on- ROV
processing and real-time detection of different aqua-net defects such as
biofouling, vegetation, net holes, and plastic. The proposed system integrates
both deep learning-based methods for aqua-net defect detection and feedback
control law for the vehicle movement around the aqua-net to obtain a clear
sequence of net images and inspect the status of the net via performing the
inspection tasks. This work contributes to the area of aquaculture inspection,
marine robotics, and deep learning aiming to reduce cost, improve quality, and
ease of operation.

<p class="mathjax">The paper aims to investigate the degree of cognitive skills required for
success in online versions of the popular card game rummy and poker. The study
focuses on analyzing the impact of experience and learnable skills on success
in the online card game. We also propose a framework to analyze online games to
conclude on whether they are games of learnable skill or are they games of
chance. The hypotheses proposed aim to test whether online and offline card
games are comparable in terms of cognitive engagement and skill requirements.
To assess these hypotheses, key elements of gameplay such as shuffling of
cards, card deck randomness, and seating of players are analyzed. We also
adopted statistical approaches to understand the characteristics of card games
in terms of random chance or skill. From the analysis, we could see that the
normality of the derived variables deviates significantly from the normal
distribution showing a non-linear trend. It signifies that the mean of the
involved skill variables is not zero as the user plays a greater number of
games, thereby strengthening the assumption that the long-term success in
online card games is attributed to skill and not chance. There is no difference
in online and offline versions of card games (rummy and poker) from the
perspective of requirement of skills. Moreover, our finding suggests that there
is a preponderance of skills to succeed in online card gaming. Overall, the
findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of cognitive
skills in online gaming environments.

<p class="mathjax">Memory disaggregation has recently been adopted in data centers to improve
resource utilization, motivated by cost and sustainability. Recent studies on
large-scale HPC facilities have also highlighted memory underutilization. A
promising and non-disruptive option for memory disaggregation is rack-scale
memory pooling, where shared memory pools supplement node-local memory. This
work outlines the prospects and requirements for adoption and clarifies several
misconceptions. We propose a quantitative method for dissecting application
requirements on the memory system from the top down in three levels, moving
from general, to multi-tier memory systems, and then to memory pooling. We
provide a multi-level profiling tool and LBench to facilitate the quantitative
approach. We evaluate a set of representative HPC workloads on an emulated
platform. Our results show that prefetching activities can significantly
influence memory traffic profiles. Interference in memory pooling has varied
impacts on applications, depending on their access ratios to memory tiers and
arithmetic intensities. Finally, in two case studies, we show the benefits of
our findings at the application and system levels, achieving 50% reduction in
remote access and 13% speedup in BFS, and reducing performance variation of
co-located workloads in interference-aware job scheduling.

<p class="mathjax">Active automata learning algorithms cannot easily handle \emph{conflict} in
the observation data (different outputs observed for the same inputs). This
inherent inability to recover after a conflict impairs their effective
applicability in scenarios where noise is present or the system under learning
is mutating.
<br />We propose the Conflict-Aware Active Automata Learning (C3AL) framework to
enable handling conflicting information during the learning process. The core
idea is to consider the so-called observation tree as a first-class citizen in
the learning process. Though this idea is explored in recent work, we take it
to its full effect by enabling its use with any existing learner and minimizing
the number of tests performed on the system under learning, specially in the
face of conflicts. We evaluate C3AL in a large set of benchmarks, covering over
30 different realistic targets, and over 18,000 different scenarios. The
results of the evaluation show that C3AL is a suitable alternative framework
for closed-box learning that can better handle noise and mutations.targets, and
over 18,000 different scenarios. The results of the evaluation show that C3AL

<p class="mathjax">WhatsApp has introduced a novel avenue for smartphone users to engage with
and disseminate news stories. The convenience of forming interest-based groups
and seamlessly sharing content has rendered WhatsApp susceptible to the
exploitation of misinformation campaigns. While the process of fact-checking
remains a potent tool in identifying fabricated news, its efficacy falters in
the face of the unprecedented deluge of information generated on the Internet
today. In this work, we explore automatic ranking-based strategies to propose a
"fakeness score" model as a means to help fact-checking agencies identify fake
news stories shared through images on WhatsApp. Based on the results, we design
a tool and integrate it into a real system that has been used extensively for
monitoring content during the 2018 Brazilian general election. Our experimental
evaluation shows that this tool can reduce by up to 40% the amount of effort
required to identify 80% of the fake news in the data when compared to current
mechanisms practiced by the fact-checking agencies for the selection of news
stories to be checked.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating progress across fields and industries,
but relies on accessible and high-quality training data. Some of the most
important datasets are found in biomedical and financial domains in the form of
spreadsheets and relational databases. But this tabular data is often sensitive
in nature. Synthetic data generation offers the potential to unlock sensitive
data, but generative models tend to memorise and regurgitate training data,
which undermines the privacy goal. To remedy this, researchers have
incorporated the mathematical framework of Differential Privacy (DP) into the
training process of deep neural networks. But this creates a trade-off between
the quality and privacy of the resulting data. Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) are the dominant paradigm for synthesising tabular data under DP, but
suffer from unstable adversarial training and mode collapse, which are
exacerbated by the privacy constraints and challenging tabular data modality.
This work optimises the quality-privacy trade-off of generative models,
producing higher quality tabular datasets with the same privacy guarantees. We
implement novel end-to-end models that leverage attention mechanisms to learn
reversible tabular representations. We also introduce TableDiffusion, the first
differentially-private diffusion model for tabular data synthesis. Our
experiments show that TableDiffusion produces higher-fidelity synthetic
datasets, avoids the mode collapse problem, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on privatised tabular data synthesis. By implementing
TableDiffusion to predict the added noise, we enabled it to bypass the
challenges of reconstructing mixed-type tabular data. Overall, the diffusion
paradigm proves vastly more data and privacy efficient than the adversarial
paradigm, due to augmented re-use of each data batch and a smoother iterative
training process.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, one of the critical challenges in forensics is analyzing the
enormous amounts of unstructured digital evidence, such as images. Often,
unstructured digital evidence contains precious information for forensic
investigations. Therefore, a retrieval system that can effectively identify
forensically relevant images is paramount. In this work, we explored the
effectiveness of interactive learning in improving image retrieval performance
in the forensic domain by proposing Excalibur - a zero-shot cross-modal image
retrieval system extended with interactive learning. Excalibur was evaluated
using both simulations and a user study. The simulations reveal that
interactive learning is highly effective in improving retrieval performance in
the forensic domain. Furthermore, user study participants could effectively
leverage the power of interactive learning. Finally, they considered Excalibur
effective and straightforward to use and expressed interest in using it in
their daily practice.

social networks offer vast opportunities for computational social science, but
effective user embedding is crucial for downstream tasks. Traditionally,
researchers have used pre-defined network-based user features, such as degree,

reposts. However, these measures may not capture the complex characteristics of
social media users. In this study, we propose a user embedding method based on

performance of this method in binary classification tasks using benchmark

directly from the retweet network, and those based on language, performed below
expectations. In contrast, our domain-based embeddings outperformed these
methods while reducing computation time. These findings suggest that the
domain-based user embedding can serve as an effective tool to characterize
social media users participating in competing events, such as political
campaigns and public health crises.

<p class="mathjax">A particularly challenging problem in AI safety is providing guarantees on
the behavior of high-dimensional autonomous systems. Verification approaches
centered around reachability analysis fail to scale, and purely statistical
approaches are constrained by the distributional assumptions about the sampling
process. Instead, we pose a distributionally robust version of the statistical
verification problem for black-box systems, where our performance guarantees
hold over a large family of distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach
based on a combination of active learning, uncertainty quantification, and
neural network verification. A central piece of our approach is an ensemble
technique called Imprecise Neural Networks, which provides the uncertainty to
guide active learning. The active learning uses an exhaustive neural-network
verification tool Sherlock to collect samples. An evaluation on multiple
physical simulators in the openAI gym Mujoco environments with
reinforcement-learned controllers demonstrates that our approach can provide
useful and scalable guarantees for high-dimensional systems.

<p class="mathjax">Novel view synthesis aims to render unseen views given a set of calibrated
images. In practical applications, the coverage, appearance or geometry of the
scene may change over time, with new images continuously being captured.
Efficiently incorporating such continuous change is an open challenge. Standard
NeRF benchmarks only involve scene coverage expansion. To study other practical
scene changes, we propose a new dataset, World Across Time (WAT), consisting of
scenes that change in appearance and geometry over time. We also propose a
simple yet effective method, CLNeRF, which introduces continual learning (CL)
to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). CLNeRF combines generative replay and the
Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) architecture to effectively prevent
catastrophic forgetting and efficiently update the model when new data arrives.
We also add trainable appearance and geometry embeddings to NGP, allowing a
single compact model to handle complex scene changes. Without the need to store
historical images, CLNeRF trained sequentially over multiple scans of a
changing scene performs on-par with the upper bound model trained on all scans
at once. Compared to other CL baselines CLNeRF performs much better across
standard benchmarks and WAT. The source code, and the WAT dataset are available
at https://github.com/IntelLabs/CLNeRF. Video presentation is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability of an intelligent system to
sequentially acquire and retain knowledge from a stream of data with as little
computational overhead as possible. To this end; regularization, replay,
architecture, and parameter isolation approaches were introduced to the
literature. Parameter isolation using a sparse network which enables to
allocate distinct parts of the neural network to different tasks and also
allows to share of parameters between tasks if they are similar. Dynamic Sparse
Training (DST) is a prominent way to find these sparse networks and isolate
them for each task. This paper is the first empirical study investigating the
effect of different DST components under the CL paradigm to fill a critical
research gap and shed light on the optimal configuration of DST for CL if it
exists. Therefore, we perform a comprehensive study in which we investigate
various DST components to find the best topology per task on well-known
CIFAR100 and miniImageNet benchmarks in a task-incremental CL setup since our
primary focus is to evaluate the performance of various DST criteria, rather
than the process of mask selection. We found that, at a low sparsity level,
Erdos-Renyi Kernel (ERK) initialization utilizes the backbone more efficiently
and allows to effectively learn increments of tasks. At a high sparsity level,
however, uniform initialization demonstrates more reliable and robust
performance. In terms of growth strategy; performance is dependent on the
defined initialization strategy, and the extent of sparsity. Finally,
adaptivity within DST components is a promising way for better continual
learners.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a novel video dataset recorded from overlapping highway
traffic cameras along an urban interstate, enabling multi-camera 3D object
tracking in a traffic monitoring context. Data is released from 3 scenes
containing video from at least 16 cameras each, totaling 57 minutes in length.
877,000 3D bounding boxes and corresponding object tracklets are fully and
accurately annotated for each camera field of view and are combined into a
spatially and temporally continuous set of vehicle trajectories for each scene.
Lastly, existing algorithms are combined to benchmark a number of 3D
multi-camera tracking pipelines on the dataset, with results indicating that
the dataset is challenging due to the difficulty of matching objects traveling
at high speeds across cameras and heavy object occlusion, potentially for
hundreds of frames, during congested traffic. This work aims to enable the
development of accurate and automatic vehicle trajectory extraction algorithms,
which will play a vital role in understanding impacts of autonomous vehicle
technologies on the safety and efficiency of traffic.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of graph analytics on evolving graphs. In this
scenario, a query typically needs to be applied to different snapshots of the
graph over an extended time window. We propose CommonGraph, an approach for
efficient processing of queries on evolving graphs. We first observe that edge
deletions are significantly more expensive than addition operations.
CommonGraph converts all deletions to additions by finding a common graph that
exists across all snapshots. After computing the query on this graph, to reach
any snapshot, we simply need to add the missing edges and incrementally update
the query results. CommonGraph also allows sharing of common additions among
snapshots that require them, and breaks the sequential dependency inherent in
the traditional streaming approach where snapshots are processed in sequence,
enabling additional opportunities for parallelism. We incorporate the
CommonGraph approach by extending the KickStarter streaming framework.
CommonGraph achieves 1.38x-8.17x improvement in performance over Kickstarter
across multiple benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents an evaluation of six prominent commercial endpoint malware
detectors, a network malware detector, and a file-conviction algorithm from a
cyber technology vendor. The evaluation was administered as the first of the
Artificial Intelligence Applications to Autonomous Cybersecurity (AI ATAC)
prize challenges, funded by / completed in service of the US Navy. The
experiment employed 100K files (50/50% benign/malicious) with a stratified
distribution of file types, including ~1K zero-day program executables
(increasing experiment size two orders of magnitude over previous work). We
present an evaluation process of delivering a file to a fresh virtual machine
donning the detection technology, waiting 90s to allow static detection, then
executing the file and waiting another period for dynamic detection; this
allows greater fidelity in the observational data than previous experiments, in
particular, resource and time-to-detection statistics. To execute all 800K
trials (100K files $\times$ 8 tools), a software framework is designed to
choreographed the experiment into a completely automated, time-synced, and
reproducible workflow with substantial parallelization. A cost-benefit model
was configured to integrate the tools' recall, precision, time to detection,
and resource requirements into a single comparable quantity by simulating costs
of use. This provides a ranking methodology for cyber competitions and a lens
through which to reason about the varied statistical viewpoints of the results.
These statistical and cost-model results provide insights on state of
commercial malware detection.

<p class="mathjax">Oblivious Reconfigurable Networks (ORNs) use rapidly reconfiguring switches
to create a dynamic time-varying topology. Prior theoretical work on ORNs has
focused on the tradeoff between maximum latency and guaranteed throughput. This
work shows that by relaxing the notion of guaranteed throughput to an
achievable rate with high probability, one can achieve a significant
improvement in the latency/throughput tradeoff. For a fixed maximum latency, we
show that almost twice the maximum possible guaranteed throughput rate can be
achieved with high probability. Alternatively for a fixed throughput value,
relaxing to achievement with high probability decreases the maximum latency to
almost the square root of the latency required to guarantee the throughput
rate.
<br />We first give a lower bound on the best maximum latency possible given an
achieved throughput rate with high probability. This is done using an LP
duality style argument. We then give a family of ORN designs which achieves
these tradeoffs. The connection schedule is based on the Vandermonde Basis
Scheme of Amir, Wilson, Shrivastav, Weatherspoon, Kleinberg, and Agarwal,
although the period and routing scheme differ significantly. We prove
achievable throughput with high probability by interpreting the amount of flow
on each edge as a sum of negatively associated variables, and applying a
Chernoff bound. This gives us a design with maximum latency that is tight with
our lower bound (up to a log factor) for almost all constant throughput values.

<p class="mathjax">Imbalanced datasets are commonly observed in various real-world applications,
presenting significant challenges in training classifiers. When working with
large datasets, the imbalanced issue can be further exacerbated, making it
exceptionally difficult to train classifiers effectively. To address the
problem, over-sampling techniques have been developed to linearly interpolating
data instances between minorities and their neighbors. However, in many
real-world scenarios such as anomaly detection, minority instances are often
dispersed diversely in the feature space rather than clustered together.
Inspired by domain-agnostic data mix-up, we propose generating synthetic
samples iteratively by mixing data samples from both minority and majority
classes. It is non-trivial to develop such a framework, the challenges include
source sample selection, mix-up strategy selection, and the coordination
between the underlying model and mix-up strategies. To tackle these challenges,
we formulate the problem of iterative data mix-up as a Markov decision process
(MDP) that maps data attributes onto an augmentation strategy. To solve the
MDP, we employ an actor-critic framework to adapt the discrete-continuous
decision space. This framework is utilized to train a data augmentation policy
and design a reward signal that explores classifier uncertainty and encourages
performance improvement, irrespective of the classifier's convergence. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through extensive
experiments conducted on seven publicly available benchmark datasets using
three different types of classifiers. The results of these experiments showcase
the potential and promise of our framework in addressing imbalanced datasets
with diverse minorities.

<p class="mathjax">Every major technical invention resurfaces the dual-use dilemma -- the new
technology has the potential to be used for good as well as for harm.
Generative AI (GenAI) techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, have shown remarkable capabilities (e.g., in-context
learning, code-completion, and text-to-image generation and editing). However,
GenAI can be used just as well by attackers to generate new attacks and
increase the velocity and efficacy of existing attacks.
<br />This paper reports the findings of a workshop held at Google (co-organized by
Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison) on the dual-use
dilemma posed by GenAI. This paper is not meant to be comprehensive, but is
rather an attempt to synthesize some of the interesting findings from the
workshop. We discuss short-term and long-term goals for the community on this
topic. We hope this paper provides both a launching point for a discussion on
this important topic as well as interesting problems that the research
community can work to address.

<p class="mathjax">Ergonomic efficiency is essential to the mass and prolonged adoption of VR/AR
experiences. While VR/AR head-mounted displays unlock users' natural wide-range
head movements during viewing, their neck muscle comfort is inevitably
compromised by the added hardware weight. Unfortunately, little quantitative
knowledge for understanding and addressing such an issue is available so far.
<br />Leveraging electromyography devices, we measure, model, and predict VR users'
neck muscle contraction levels (MCL) while they move their heads to interact
with the virtual environment. Specifically, by learning from collected
physiological data, we develop a bio-physically inspired computational model to
predict neck MCL under diverse head kinematic states. Beyond quantifying the
cumulative MCL of completed head movements, our model can also predict
potential MCL requirements with target head poses only. A series of objective
evaluations and user studies demonstrate its prediction accuracy and
generality, as well as its ability in reducing users' neck discomfort by
optimizing the layout of visual targets. We hope this research will motivate
new ergonomic-centered designs for VR/AR and interactive graphics applications.

<p class="mathjax">Human activity recognition (HAR) using machine learning has shown tremendous
promise in detecting construction workers' activities. HAR has many
applications in human-robot interaction research to enable robots'
understanding of human counterparts' activities. However, many existing HAR
approaches lack robustness, generalizability, and adaptability. This paper
proposes a transfer learning methodology for activity recognition of
construction workers that requires orders of magnitude less data and compute
time for comparable or better classification accuracy. The developed algorithm
transfers features from a model pre-trained by the original authors and
fine-tunes them for the downstream task of activity recognition in
construction. The model was pre-trained on Kinetics-400, a large-scale
video-based human activity recognition dataset with 400 distinct classes. The
model was fine-tuned and tested using videos captured from manual material
handling (MMH) activities found on YouTube. Results indicate that the
fine-tuned model can recognize distinct MMH tasks in a robust and adaptive
manner which is crucial for the widespread deployment of collaborative robots
in construction.

<p class="mathjax">Many real-world data stream applications not only suffer from concept drift
but also class imbalance. Yet, very few existing studies investigated this
joint challenge. Data difficulty factors, which have been shown to be key
challenges in class imbalanced data streams, are not taken into account by
existing approaches when learning class imbalanced data streams. In this work,
we propose a drift adaptable oversampling strategy to synthesise minority class
examples based on stream clustering. The motivation is that stream clustering
methods continuously update themselves to reflect the characteristics of the
current underlying concept, including data difficulty factors. This nature can
potentially be used to compress past information without caching data in the
memory explicitly. Based on the compressed information, synthetic examples can
be created within the region that recently generated new minority class
examples. Experiments with artificial and real-world data streams show that the
proposed approach can handle concept drift involving different minority class
decomposition better than existing approaches, especially when the data stream
is severely class imbalanced and presenting high proportions of safe and
borderline minority class examples.

<p class="mathjax">Construction technology researchers and forward-thinking companies are
experimenting with collaborative robots (aka cobots), powered by artificial
intelligence (AI), to explore various automation scenarios as part of the
digital transformation of the industry. Intelligent cobots are expected to be
the dominant type of robots in the future of work in construction. However, the
black-box nature of AI-powered cobots and unknown technical and psychological
aspects of introducing them to job sites are precursors to trust challenges. By
analyzing the results of semi-structured interviews with construction
practitioners using grounded theory, this paper investigates the
characteristics of trustworthy AI-powered cobots in construction. The study
found that while the key trust factors identified in a systematic literature
review -- conducted previously by the authors -- resonated with the field
experts and end users, other factors such as financial considerations and the
uncertainty associated with change were also significant barriers against
trusting AI-powered cobots in construction.

<p class="mathjax">Obtaining personalized 3D animatable avatars from a monocular camera has
several real world applications in gaming, virtual try-on, animation, and
VR/XR, etc. However, it is very challenging to model dynamic and fine-grained
clothing deformations from such sparse data. Existing methods for modeling 3D
humans from depth data have limitations in terms of computational efficiency,
mesh coherency, and flexibility in resolution and topology. For instance,
reconstructing shapes using implicit functions and extracting explicit meshes
per frame is computationally expensive and cannot ensure coherent meshes across
frames. Moreover, predicting per-vertex deformations on a pre-designed human
template with a discrete surface lacks flexibility in resolution and topology.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method `\keyfeature: Neural
Surface Fields' for modeling 3D clothed humans from monocular depth. NSF
defines a neural field solely on the base surface which models a continuous and
flexible displacement field. NSF can be adapted to the base surface with
different resolution and topology without retraining at inference time.
Compared to existing approaches, our method eliminates the expensive per-frame
surface extraction while maintaining mesh coherency, and is capable of
reconstructing meshes with arbitrary resolution without retraining. To foster
research in this direction, we release our code in project page at:

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art face recognition networks are often computationally
expensive and cannot be used for mobile applications. Training lightweight face
recognition models also requires large identity-labeled datasets. Meanwhile,
there are privacy and ethical concerns with collecting and using large face
recognition datasets. While generating synthetic datasets for training face
recognition models is an alternative option, it is challenging to generate
synthetic data with sufficient intra-class variations. In addition, there is
still a considerable gap between the performance of models trained on real and
synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a new framework (named SynthDistill)
to train lightweight face recognition models by distilling the knowledge of a
pretrained teacher face recognition model using synthetic data. We use a
pretrained face generator network to generate synthetic face images and use the
synthesized images to learn a lightweight student network. We use synthetic
face images without identity labels, mitigating the problems in the intra-class
variation generation of synthetic datasets. Instead, we propose a novel dynamic
sampling strategy from the intermediate latent space of the face generator
network to include new variations of the challenging images while further
exploring new face images in the training batch. The results on five different
face recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of our lightweight model
compared to models trained on previous synthetic datasets, achieving a
verification accuracy of 99.52% on the LFW dataset with a lightweight network.
The results also show that our proposed framework significantly reduces the gap
between training with real and synthetic data. The source code for replicating
the experiments is publicly released.

<p class="mathjax">Recent applications of machine learning in metal additive manufacturing (MAM)
have demonstrated significant potential in addressing critical barriers to the
widespread adoption of MAM technology. Recent research in this field emphasizes
the importance of utilizing melt pool signatures for real-time defect
prediction. While high-quality melt pool image data holds the promise of
enabling precise predictions, there has been limited exploration into the
utilization of cutting-edge spatiotemporal models that can harness the inherent
transient and sequential characteristics of the additive manufacturing process.
This research introduces and puts into practice some of the leading deep
spatiotemporal learning models that can be adapted for the classification of
melt pool image streams originating from various materials, systems, and
applications. Specifically, it investigates two-stream networks comprising
spatial and temporal streams, a recurrent spatial network, and a factorized 3D
convolutional neural network. The capacity of these models to generalize when
exposed to perturbations in melt pool image data is examined using data
perturbation techniques grounded in real-world process scenarios. The
implemented architectures demonstrate the ability to capture the spatiotemporal
features of melt pool image sequences. However, among these models, only the
Kinetics400 pre-trained SlowFast network, categorized as a two-stream network,
exhibits robust generalization capabilities in the presence of data
perturbations.

<p class="mathjax">Clustering trajectories is a central challenge when confronted with large
amounts of movement data such as full-body motion data or GPS data. We study a
clustering problem that can be stated as a geometric set cover problem: Given a
polygonal curve of complexity $n$, find the smallest number $k$ of
representative trajectories of complexity at most $l$ such that any point on
the input trajectories lies on a subtrajectory of the input that has Fr\'echet
distance at most $\Delta$ to one of the representative trajectories. This
problem was first studied by Akitaya et al. (2021) and Br\"uning et al. (2022).
They present a bicriteria approximation algorithm that returns a set of curves
of size $O(kl\log(kl))$ which covers the input with a radius of $11\Delta$ in
time $\widetilde{O}((kl)^2n + kln^3)$, where $k$ is the smallest number of
curves of complexity $l$ needed to cover the input with a distance of $\Delta$.
The representative trajectories computed by their algorithm are always line
segments. In applications however, one is usually interested in representative
curves of higher complexity which consist of several edges. We present a new
approach that builds upon the works of Br\"uning et al. (2022) computing a set
of curves of size $O(k\log(n))$ in time $\widetilde{O}(l^2n^4 + kln^4)$ with
the same distance guarantee of $11\Delta$, where each curve may consist of
curves of complexity up to the given complexity parameter $l$. To validate our
approach, we conduct experiments on different types of real world data:
high-dimensional full-body motion data and low-dimensional GPS-tracking data.

A key component of our analysis is the use of a weak estimate on bounded
variation, which follows from the semi-discrete entropy stability property of
the method under investigation. For the Euler equations of gas dynamics, we
prove the weak convergence of the flux-corrected finite element scheme to a

<p class="mathjax">Document scaling has been a key component in text-as-data applications for
social scientists and a major field of interest for political researchers, who
aim at uncovering differences between speakers or parties with the help of
different probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches. Yet, most of these
techniques are either built upon the agnostically bag-of-word hypothesis or use
prior information borrowed from external sources that might embed the results
with a significant bias. If the corpus has long been considered as a collection
of documents, it can also be seen as a dense network of connected words whose
structure could be clustered to differentiate independent groups of words,
based on their co-occurrences in documents, known as communities. This paper
introduces CommunityFish as an augmented version of Wordfish based on a
hierarchical clustering, namely the Louvain algorithm, on the word space to
yield communities as semantic and independent n-grams emerging from the corpus
and use them as an input to Wordfish method, instead of considering the word
space. This strategy emphasizes the interpretability of the results, since
communities have a non-overlapping structure, hence a crucial informative power
in discriminating parties or speakers, in addition to allowing a faster
execution of the Poisson scaling model. Aside from yielding communities,
assumed to be subtopic proxies, the application of this technique outperforms
the classic Wordfish model by highlighting historical developments in the U.S.
State of the Union addresses and was found to replicate the prevailing
political stance in Germany when using the corpus of parties' legislative
manifestos.

<p class="mathjax">Recent laws to ensure the security and protection of personal data establish
new software requirements. Consequently, new technologies are needed to
guarantee software quality under the perception of privacy and protection of
personal data. Therefore, we created a checklist-based inspection technique
(LGPDCheck) to support the identification of defects in software artifacts
based on the principles established by the Brazilian General Data Protection
Law (LGPD). Objective/Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
LGPDCheck for verifying privacy and data protection (PDP) in software artifacts
compared to ad-hoc techniques. Method: To assess LGPDCheck and ad-hoc
techniques experimentally through a quasi-experiment (two factors, five
treatments). The data will be collected from IoT-based health software systems
built by software engineering students from the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro. The data analyses will compare results from ad-hoc and LGPDCheck
inspections, the participant's effectiveness and efficiency in each trial,
defects' variance and standard deviation, and time spent with the reviews. The
data will be screened for outliers, and normality and homoscedasticity will be
verified using the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests. Nonparametric or parametric
tests, such as the Wilcoxon or Student's t-tests, will be applied as
appropriate.

<p class="mathjax">Human/User interaction with buildings are mostly restricted to interacting
with building automation systems through user-interfaces that mainly aim to
improve energy efficiency of buildings and ensure comfort of occupants. This
research builds on the existing theories of Human-Building Interaction (HBI)
and proposes a novel conceptual framework for HBI that combines the concepts of
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Ambient Intelligence (AmI). The proposed
framework aims to study the needs of occupants in specific-purpose buildings,
which is currently undermined. Specifically, we explore the application of the
proposed HBI framework to improve the learning experience of students in
academic buildings. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted
among students who are considered primary occupants of Goodwin Hall, a flagship
smart engineering building at Virginia Tech. Qualitative coding and concept
mapping were used to analyze the qualitative data and determine the impact of
occupant-specific needs on the learning experience of students in academic
buildings. The occupant-specific problem that was found to have the highest
direct impact on learning experience was finding study space and highest
indirect impact was Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ). We discuss new ideas for
designing Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI), e.g. Augmented Reality (AR),
increase the perceivable affordances for building occupants and considering a
context-aware ubiquitous analytics-based strategy to provide services that are
tailored to address the identified needs.

<p class="mathjax">The Rowhammer vulnerability continues to get worse, with the Rowhammer
Threshold (TRH) reducing from 139K activations to 4.8K activations over the
last decade. Typical Rowhammer mitigations rely on tracking aggressor rows. The
number of possible aggressors increases with lowering thresholds, making it
difficult to reliably track such rows in a storage-efficient manner. At lower
thresholds, academic trackers such as Graphene require prohibitive SRAM
overheads (hundreds of KBs to MB). Recent in-DRAM trackers from industry, such
as DSAC-TRR, perform approximate tracking, sacrificing guaranteed protection
for reduced storage overheads, leaving DRAM vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks.
Ideally, we seek a scalable tracker that tracks securely and precisely, and
incurs negligible dedicated SRAM and performance overheads, while still being
able to track arbitrarily low thresholds.
<br />To that end, we propose START - a Scalable Tracker for Any Rowhammer
Threshold. Rather than relying on dedicated SRAM structures, START dynamically
repurposes a small fraction the Last-Level Cache (LLC) to store tracking
metadata. START is based on the observation that while the memory contains
millions of rows, typical workloads touch only a small subset of rows within a
refresh period of 64ms, so allocating tracking entries on demand significantly
reduces storage. If the application does not access many rows in memory, START
does not reserve any LLC capacity. Otherwise, START dynamically uses 1-way,
2-way, or 8-way of the cache set based on demand. START consumes, on average,
9.4% of the LLC capacity to store metadata, which is 5X lower compared to
dedicating a counter in LLC for each row in memory. We also propose START-M, a
memory-mapped START for large-memory systems. Our designs require only 4KB SRAM
for newly added structures and perform within 1% of idealized tracking even at
TRH of less than 100.

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art image models predominantly follow a two-stage strategy:
pre-training on large datasets and fine-tuning with cross-entropy loss. Many
studies have shown that using cross-entropy can result in sub-optimal
generalisation and stability. While the supervised contrastive loss addresses
some limitations of cross-entropy loss by focusing on intra-class similarities
and inter-class differences, it neglects the importance of hard negative
mining. We propose that models will benefit from performance improvement by
weighting negative samples based on their dissimilarity to positive
counterparts. In this paper, we introduce a new supervised contrastive learning
objective, SCHaNe, which incorporates hard negative sampling during the
fine-tuning phase. Without requiring specialized architectures, additional
data, or extra computational resources, experimental results indicate that
SCHaNe outperforms the strong baseline BEiT-3 in Top-1 accuracy across various
benchmarks, with significant gains of up to $3.32\%$ in few-shot learning
settings and $3.41\%$ in full dataset fine-tuning. Importantly, our proposed
objective sets a new state-of-the-art for base models on ImageNet-1k, achieving
an 86.14\% accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed objective
yields better embeddings and explains the improved effectiveness observed in
our experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion recognition in conversations is essential for ensuring advanced
human-machine interactions. However, creating robust and accurate emotion
recognition systems in real life is challenging, mainly due to the scarcity of
emotion datasets collected in the wild and the inability to take into account
the dialogue context. The CEMO dataset, composed of conversations between
agents and patients during emergency calls to a French call center, fills this
gap. The nature of these interactions highlights the role of the emotional flow
of the conversation in predicting patient emotions, as context can often make a
difference in understanding actual feelings. This paper presents a multi-scale
conversational context learning approach for speech emotion recognition, which
takes advantage of this hypothesis. We investigated this approach on both
speech transcriptions and acoustic segments. Experimentally, our method uses
the previous or next information of the targeted segment. In the text domain,
we tested the context window using a wide range of tokens (from 10 to 100) and
at the speech turns level, considering inputs from both the same and opposing
speakers. According to our tests, the context derived from previous tokens has
a more significant influence on accurate prediction than the following tokens.
Furthermore, taking the last speech turn of the same speaker in the
conversation seems useful. In the acoustic domain, we conducted an in-depth
analysis of the impact of the surrounding emotions on the prediction. While
multi-scale conversational context learning using Transformers can enhance
performance in the textual modality for emergency call recordings,
incorporating acoustic context is more challenging.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the problem of machine learning-based (ML) predictive
inference on individual treatment effects (ITEs). Previous work has focused
primarily on developing ML-based meta-learners that can provide point estimates
of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE); these are model-agnostic
approaches for combining intermediate nuisance estimates to produce estimates
of CATE. In this paper, we develop conformal meta-learners, a general framework
for issuing predictive intervals for ITEs by applying the standard conformal
prediction (CP) procedure on top of CATE meta-learners. We focus on a broad
class of meta-learners based on two-stage pseudo-outcome regression and develop
a stochastic ordering framework to study their validity. We show that inference
with conformal meta-learners is marginally valid if their (pseudo outcome)
conformity scores stochastically dominate oracle conformity scores evaluated on
the unobserved ITEs. Additionally, we prove that commonly used CATE
meta-learners, such as the doubly-robust learner, satisfy a model- and
distribution-free stochastic (or convex) dominance condition, making their
conformal inferences valid for practically-relevant levels of target coverage.
Whereas existing procedures conduct inference on nuisance parameters (i.e.,
potential outcomes) via weighted CP, conformal meta-learners enable direct
inference on the target parameter (ITE). Numerical experiments show that
conformal meta-learners provide valid intervals with competitive efficiency
while retaining the favorable point estimation properties of CATE
meta-learners.

<p class="mathjax">Offline reinforcement learning aims to utilize datasets of previously
gathered environment-action interaction records to learn a policy without
access to the real environment. Recent work has shown that offline
reinforcement learning can be formulated as a sequence modeling problem and
solved via supervised learning with approaches such as decision transformer.
While these sequence-based methods achieve competitive results over
return-to-go methods, especially on tasks that require longer episodes or with
scarce rewards, importance sampling is not considered to correct the policy
bias when dealing with off-policy data, mainly due to the absence of behavior
policy and the use of deterministic evaluation policies. To this end, we
propose DPE: an RL algorithm that blends offline sequence modeling and offline
reinforcement learning with Double Policy Estimation (DPE) in a unified
framework with statistically proven properties on variance reduction. We
validate our method in multiple tasks of OpenAI Gym with D4RL benchmarks. Our
method brings a performance improvements on selected methods which outperforms
SOTA baselines in several tasks, demonstrating the advantages of enabling
double policy estimation for sequence-modeled reinforcement learning.

<p class="mathjax">Object-centric representation learning offers the potential to overcome
limitations of image-level representations by explicitly parsing image scenes
into their constituent components. While image-level representations typically
lack robustness to natural image corruptions, the robustness of object-centric
methods remains largely untested. To address this gap, we present the
RobustCLEVR benchmark dataset and evaluation framework. Our framework takes a
novel approach to evaluating robustness by enabling the specification of causal
dependencies in the image generation process grounded in expert knowledge and
capable of producing a wide range of image corruptions unattainable in existing
robustness evaluations. Using our framework, we define several causal models of
the image corruption process which explicitly encode assumptions about the
causal relationships and distributions of each corruption type. We generate
dataset variants for each causal model on which we evaluate state-of-the-art
object-centric methods. Overall, we find that object-centric methods are not
inherently robust to image corruptions. Our causal evaluation approach exposes
model sensitivities not observed using conventional evaluation processes,
yielding greater insight into robustness differences across algorithms. Lastly,
while conventional robustness evaluations view corruptions as
out-of-distribution, we use our causal framework to show that even training on
in-distribution image corruptions does not guarantee increased model
robustness. This work provides a step towards more concrete and substantiated
understanding of model performance and deterioration under complex corruption
processes of the real-world.

<p class="mathjax">We address the task of supervised action segmentation which aims to partition
a video into non-overlapping segments, each representing a different action.
Recent works apply transformers to perform temporal modeling at the
frame-level, which suffer from high computational cost and cannot well capture
action dependencies over long temporal horizons. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient BI-level Temporal modeling (BIT) framework that learns
explicit action tokens to represent action segments, in parallel performs
temporal modeling on frame and action levels, while maintaining a low
computational cost. Our model contains (i) a frame branch that uses convolution
to learn frame-level relationships, (ii) an action branch that uses transformer
to learn action-level dependencies with a small set of action tokens and (iii)
cross-attentions to allow communication between the two branches. We apply and
extend a set-prediction objective to allow each action token to represent one
or multiple action segments, thus can avoid learning a large number of tokens
over long videos with many segments. Thanks to the design of our action branch,
we can also seamlessly leverage textual transcripts of videos (when available)
to help action segmentation by using them to initialize the action tokens. We
evaluate our model on four video datasets (two egocentric and two third-person)
for action segmentation with and without transcripts, showing that BIT
significantly improves the state-of-the-art accuracy with much lower
computational cost (30 times faster) compared to existing transformer-based
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation models are vital in delivering personalized user experiences
by leveraging the correlation between multiple input features. However, deep
learning-based recommendation models often face challenges due to evolving user
behaviour and item features, leading to covariate shifts. Effective
cross-feature learning is crucial to handle data distribution drift and
adapting to changing user behaviour. Traditional feature interaction techniques
have limitations in achieving optimal performance in this context.
<br />This work introduces Ad-Rec, an advanced network that leverages feature
interaction techniques to address covariate shifts. This helps eliminate
irrelevant interactions in recommendation tasks. Ad-Rec leverages masked
transformers to enable the learning of higher-order cross-features while
mitigating the impact of data distribution drift. Our approach improves model
quality, accelerates convergence, and reduces training time, as measured by the
Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. We demonstrate the scalability of Ad-Rec and its
ability to achieve superior model quality through comprehensive ablation
studies.

up inference. However, memory also leads to much greater storage requirements
from storing pre-computed representations.
<br />We propose MEMORY-VQ, a new method to reduce storage requirements of
memory-augmented models without sacrificing performance. Our method uses a
vector quantization variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to compress token
representations. We apply MEMORY-VQ to the LUMEN model to obtain LUMEN-VQ, a
memory model that achieves a 16x compression rate with comparable performance
on the KILT benchmark. LUMEN-VQ enables practical retrieval augmentation even
for extremely large retrieval corpora.

<p class="mathjax">Active Learning (AL) for semantic segmentation is challenging due to heavy
class imbalance and different ways of defining "sample" (pixels, areas, etc.),
leaving the interpretation of the data distribution ambiguous. We propose
"Maturity-Aware Distribution Breakdown-based Active Learning'' (MADBAL), an AL
method that benefits from a hierarchical approach to define a multiview data
distribution, which takes into account the different "sample" definitions
jointly, hence able to select the most impactful segmentation pixels with
comprehensive understanding. MADBAL also features a novel uncertainty
formulation, where AL supporting modules are included to sense the features'
maturity whose weighted influence continuously contributes to the uncertainty
detection. In this way, MADBAL makes significant performance leaps even in the
early AL stage, hence reducing the training burden significantly. It
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets as
verified in our extensive experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Comparing spoken segments is a central operation to speech processing.
Traditional approaches in this area have favored frame-level dynamic
programming algorithms, such as dynamic time warping, because they require no
supervision, but they are limited in performance and efficiency. As an
alternative, acoustic word embeddings -- fixed-dimensional vector
representations of variable-length spoken word segments -- have begun to be
considered for such tasks as well. However, the current space of such
discriminative embedding models, training approaches, and their application to
real-world downstream tasks is limited. We start by considering ``single-view"
training losses where the goal is to learn an acoustic word embedding model
that separates same-word and different-word spoken segment pairs. Then, we
consider ``multi-view" contrastive losses. In this setting, acoustic word
embeddings are learned jointly with embeddings of character sequences to
generate acoustically grounded embeddings of written words, or acoustically
grounded word embeddings.
<br />In this thesis, we contribute new discriminative acoustic word embedding
(AWE) and acoustically grounded word embedding (AGWE) approaches based on
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We improve model training in terms of both
efficiency and performance. We take these developments beyond English to
several low-resource languages and show that multilingual training improves
performance when labeled data is limited. We apply our embedding models, both
monolingual and multilingual, to the downstream tasks of query-by-example
speech search and automatic speech recognition. Finally, we show how our
embedding approaches compare with and complement more recent self-supervised
speech models.

<p class="mathjax">In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data
with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly.
While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a
local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence
into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore
global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume
the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex
irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly,
most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not
suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome
these limitations, we propose \ours: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series
Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series
as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with
different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different
kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency,
we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an
equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable
algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle
imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty
quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate
our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Modern systems mitigate Rowhammer using victim refresh, which refreshes the
two neighbours of an aggressor row when it encounters a specified number of
activations. Unfortunately, complex attack patterns like Half-Double break
victim-refresh, rendering current systems vulnerable. Instead, recently
proposed secure Rowhammer mitigations rely on performing mitigative action on
the aggressor rather than the victims. Such schemes employ mitigative actions
such as row-migration or access-control and include AQUA, SRS, and Blockhammer.
While these schemes incur only modest slowdowns at Rowhammer thresholds of few
thousand, they incur prohibitive slowdowns (15%-600%) for lower thresholds that
are likely in the near future. The goal of our paper is to make secure
Rowhammer mitigations practical at such low thresholds.
<br />Our paper provides the key insights that benign application encounter
thousands of hot rows (receiving more activations than the threshold) due to
the memory mapping, which places spatially proximate lines in the same row to
maximize row-buffer hitrate. Unfortunately, this causes row to receive
activations for many frequently used lines. We propose Rubix, which breaks the
spatial correlation in the line-to-row mapping by using an encrypted address to
access the memory, reducing the likelihood of hot rows by 2 to 3 orders of
magnitude. To aid row-buffer hits, Rubix randomizes a group of 1-4 lines. We
also propose Rubix-D, which dynamically changes the line-to-row mapping.
Rubix-D minimizes hot-rows and makes it much harder for an adversary to learn
the spatial neighbourhood of a row. Rubix reduces the slowdown of AQUA (from
15% to 1%), SRS (from 60% to 2%), and Blockhammer (from 600% to 3%) while
incurring a storage of less than 1 Kilobyte.

<p class="mathjax">For personalized speech generation, a neural text-to-speech (TTS) model must
be successfully implemented with limited data from a target speaker. To this
end, the baseline TTS model needs to be amply generalized to out-of-domain data
(i.e., target speaker's speech). However, approaches to address this
out-of-domain generalization problem in TTS have yet to be thoroughly studied.
In this work, we propose an effective pruning method for a transformer known as
sparse attention, to improve the TTS model's generalization abilities. In
particular, we prune off redundant connections from self-attention layers whose
attention weights are below the threshold. To flexibly determine the pruning
strength for searching optimal degree of generalization, we also propose a new
differentiable pruning method that allows the model to automatically learn the
thresholds. Evaluations on zero-shot multi-speaker TTS verify the effectiveness
of our method in terms of voice quality and speaker similarity.

<p class="mathjax">The global fight against climate change and air pollution prioritizes the
transition to sustainable transportation options. Understanding the impacts of
various sustainable pathways on emissions, travel time, and costs is crucial
for researchers and policymakers. This research conducts a comprehensive
microsimulation of traffic and emissions in downtown Toronto, Canada, to
examine decarbonization scenarios. The resulting 140 scenarios involve
different fuel types, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) penetration rates,
and routing strategies combined with driving style. To achieve this,
transformers-based prediction models accurately forecast Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions and average speed for eco-routing. The
study finds that 100% battery electric vehicles have the lowest GHG emissions,
showing their potential as a sustainable transportation solution. However,
challenges related to cost and availability persist. Hybrid Electric Vehicles
and e-fuels demonstrate considerable emission reductions, emerging as promising
alternatives. Integrating CAVs with anticipatory routing strategies
significantly reduces GHG emissions. Additionally, eco-driving practices and
eco-routing strategies have a notable impact on NOx emissions and travel time.
Comprehensive cost analysis provides valuable insights into the economic
implications of various strategies and technologies. These findings offer
guidance to various stakeholders in formulating effective strategies, behaviour
changes, and policies for emission reduction and sustainable transportation
development.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems play an essential role in the choices people make in
domains such as entertainment, shopping, food, news, employment, and education.
The machine learning models underlying these recommender systems are often
enormously large and black-box in nature for users, content providers, and
system developers alike. It is often crucial for all stakeholders to understand
the model's rationale behind making certain predictions and recommendations.
This is especially true for the content providers whose livelihoods depend on
the recommender system. Drawing motivation from the practitioners' need, in
this work, we propose a recourse framework for recommender systems, targeted
towards the content providers. Algorithmic recourse in the recommendation
setting is a set of actions that, if executed, would modify the recommendations
(or ranking) of an item in the desired manner. A recourse suggests actions of
the form: "if a feature changes X to Y, then the ranking of that item for a set
of users will change to Z." Furthermore, we demonstrate that RecRec is highly
effective in generating valid, sparse, and actionable recourses through an
empirical evaluation of recommender systems trained on three real-world
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to conceptualize
and empirically test a generalized framework for generating recourses for
recommender systems.

<p class="mathjax">A Markov decision process can be parameterized by a transition kernel and a
reward function. Both play essential roles in the study of reinforcement
learning as evidenced by their presence in the Bellman equations. In our
inquiry of various kinds of ``costs'' associated with reinforcement learning
inspired by the demands in robotic applications, rewards are central to
understanding the structure of a Markov decision process and reward-centric
notions can elucidate important concepts in reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we studied the sample complexity of policy evaluation and
developed a novel estimator with an instance-specific error bound of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\tau_s}{n}})$ for estimating a single state value. Under
the online regret minimization setting, we refined the transition-based MDP
constant, diameter, into a reward-based constant, maximum expected hitting
cost, and with it, provided a theoretical explanation for how a well-known
technique, potential-based reward shaping, could accelerate learning with
expert knowledge. In an attempt to study safe reinforcement learning, we
modeled hazardous environments with irrecoverability and proposed a
quantitative notion of safe learning via reset efficiency. In this setting, we
modified a classic algorithm to account for resets achieving promising
preliminary numerical results. Lastly, for MDPs with multiple reward functions,
we developed a planning algorithm that computationally efficiently finds Pareto
optimal stochastic policies.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in the past
several months, shattering state-of-the-art benchmarks in many domains. This
paper investigates LLMs' behavior with respect to gender stereotypes, a known
issue for prior models. We use a simple paradigm to test the presence of gender
bias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias
dataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs.
We test four recently published LLMs and demonstrate that they express biased
assumptions about men and women's occupations. Our contributions in this paper
are as follows: (a) LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to choose an occupation that
stereotypically aligns with a person's gender; (b) these choices align with
people's perceptions better than with the ground truth as reflected in official
job statistics; (c) LLMs in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in
perceptions or the ground truth; (d) LLMs ignore crucial ambiguities in
sentence structure 95% of the time in our study items, but when explicitly
prompted, they recognize the ambiguity; (e) LLMs provide explanations for their
choices that are factually inaccurate and likely obscure the true reason behind
their predictions. That is, they provide rationalizations of their biased
behavior. This highlights a key property of these models: LLMs are trained on
imbalanced datasets; as such, even with the recent successes of reinforcement
learning with human feedback, they tend to reflect those imbalances back at us.
As with other types of societal biases, we suggest that LLMs must be carefully
tested to ensure that they treat minoritized individuals and communities
equitably.

<p class="mathjax">Dispatching strategies for gas turbines (GTs) are changing in modern
electricity grids. A growing incorporation of intermittent renewable energy
requires GTs to operate more but shorter cycles and more frequently on partial
loads. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently emerged as a tool that
can cope with this development and dispatch GTs economically. The key
advantages of DRL are a model-free optimization and the ability to handle
uncertainties, such as those introduced by varying loads or renewable energy
production. In this study, three popular DRL algorithms are implemented for an
economic GT dispatch problem on a case study in Alberta, Canada. We highlight
the benefits of DRL by incorporating an existing thermodynamic software
provided by Siemens Energy into the environment model and by simulating
uncertainty via varying electricity prices, loads, and ambient conditions.
Among the tested algorithms and baseline methods, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
obtained the highest rewards while Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) was the
most sample efficient. We further propose and implement a method to assign GT
operation and maintenance cost dynamically based on operating hours and cycles.
Compared to existing methods, our approach better approximates the true cost of
modern GT dispatch and hence leads to more realistic policies.

<p class="mathjax">Vector addition systems with states (VASS) are a popular model for concurrent
systems. However, many decision problems have prohibitively high complexity.
Therefore, it is sometimes useful to consider overapproximating semantics in
which these problems can be decided more efficiently.
<br />We study an overapproximation, called monus semantics, that slightly relaxes
the semantics of decrements: A key property of a vector addition systems is
that in order to decrement a counter, this counter must have a positive value.
In contrast, our semantics allows decrements of zero-valued counters: If such a
transition is executed, the counter just remains zero.
<br />It turns out that if only a subset of transitions is used with monus
semantics (and the others with classical semantics), then reachability is
undecidable. However, we show that if monus semantics is used throughout,
reachability remains decidable. In particular, we show that reachability for
VASS with monus semantics is as hard as that of classical VASS (i.e.
Ackermann-hard), while the zero-reachability and coverability are easier (i.e.
EXPSPACE-complete and NP-complete, respectively). We provide a comprehensive
account of the complexity of the general reachability problem, reachability of
zero configurations, and coverability under monus semantics. We study these
problems in general VASS, two-dimensional VASS, and one-dimensional VASS, with
unary and binary counter updates.

<p class="mathjax">In the era where personal devices and applications are pervasive, individuals
are continuously generating and interacting with a vast amount of data. Despite
this, access to and control over such data remains challenging due to its
scattering across various app providers and formats. This paper presents
Human-Scale Computing, a vision and an approach where every individual has
straightforward, unified access to their data across all devices, apps, and
services. Key to this solution is the Human Scale Portal, a progressively
designed intermediary that integrates different applications and service
providers. This design adopts a transitional development and deployment
strategy, involving an initial bootstrapping phase to engage application
providers, an acceleration phase to enhance the convenience of access, and an
eventual solution. We believe that this progressive "narrow waist" design can
bridge the gap between the current state of data access and our envisioned
future of human-scale access.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been a large driver and enabler for AI
breakthroughs in recent years. These models have been getting larger in their
attempt to become more accurate and tackle new upcoming use-cases, including
AR/VR and intelligent assistants. However, the training process of such large
models is a costly and time-consuming process, which typically yields a single
model to fit all targets. To mitigate this, various techniques have been
proposed in the literature, including pruning, sparsification or quantization
of the model weights and updates. While able to achieve high compression rates,
they often incur computational overheads or accuracy penalties. Alternatively,
factorization methods have been leveraged to incorporate low-rank compression
in the training process. Similarly, such techniques (e.g.,~SVD) frequently rely
on the computationally expensive decomposition of layers and are potentially
sub-optimal for non-linear models, such as DNNs. In this work, we take a
further step in designing efficient low-rank models and propose Maestro, a
framework for trainable low-rank layers. Instead of regularly applying a priori
decompositions such as SVD, the low-rank structure is built into the training
process through a generalized variant of Ordered Dropout. This method imposes
an importance ordering via sampling on the decomposed DNN structure. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method recovers the SVD
decomposition of linear mapping on uniformly distributed data and PCA for
linear autoencoders. We further apply our technique on DNNs and empirically
illustrate that Maestro enables the extraction of lower footprint models that
preserve model performance while allowing for graceful accuracy-latency
tradeoff for the deployment to devices of different capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past few years, there has been significant interest in Quantum
Machine Learning (QML) among researchers, as it has the potential to transform
the field of machine learning. Several models that exploit the properties of
quantum mechanics have been developed for practical applications. In this
study, we investigated the application of our previously proposed quantum
pre-processing filter (QPF) to binary image classification. We evaluated the
QPF on four datasets: MNIST (handwritten digits), EMNIST (handwritten digits
and alphabets), CIFAR-10 (photographic images) and GTSRB (real-life traffic
sign images). Similar to our previous multi-class classification results, the
application of QPF improved the binary image classification accuracy using
neural network against MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 from 98.9% to 99.2%, 97.8%
to 98.3%, and 71.2% to 76.1%, respectively, but degraded it against GTSRB from
93.5% to 92.0%. We then applied QPF in cases using a smaller number of training
and testing samples, i.e. 80 and 20 samples per class, respectively. In order
to derive statistically stable results, we conducted the experiment with 100
trials choosing randomly different training and testing samples and averaging
the results. The result showed that the application of QPF did not improve the
image classification accuracy against MNIST and EMNIST but improved it against
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB from 65.8% to 67.2% and 90.5% to 91.8%, respectively.
Further research will be conducted as part of future work to investigate the
potential of QPF to assess the scalability of the proposed approach to larger
and complex datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has rapidly been adopted for segmenting a
wide range of natural images. However, recent studies have indicated that SAM
exhibits subpar performance on 3D medical image segmentation tasks. In addition
to the domain gaps between natural and medical images, disparities in the
spatial arrangement between 2D and 3D images, the substantial computational
burden imposed by powerful GPU servers, and the time-consuming manual prompt
generation impede the extension of SAM to a broader spectrum of medical image
segmentation applications. To address these challenges, in this work, we
introduce a novel method, AutoSAM Adapter, designed specifically for 3D
multi-organ CT-based segmentation. We employ parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques in developing an automatic prompt learning paradigm to facilitate
the transformation of the SAM model's capabilities to 3D medical image
segmentation, eliminating the need for manually generated prompts. Furthermore,
we effectively transfer the acquired knowledge of the AutoSAM Adapter to other
lightweight models specifically tailored for 3D medical image analysis,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on medical image segmentation
tasks. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the AutoSAM
Adapter as a critical foundation for effectively leveraging the emerging
ability of foundation models in 2D natural image segmentation for 3D medical
image segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Historical photos are valuable for their cultural and economic significance,
but can be difficult to identify accurately due to various challenges such as
low-quality images, lack of corroborating evidence, and limited research
resources. Misidentified photos can have significant negative consequences,
including lost economic value, incorrect historical records, and the spread of
misinformation that can lead to perpetuating conspiracy theories. To accurately
assess the credibility of a photo identification (ID), it may be necessary to
conduct investigative research, use domain knowledge, and consult experts. In
this paper, we introduce DoubleCheck, a quality assessment framework for
verifying historical photo IDs on Civil War Photo Sleuth (CWPS), a popular
online platform for identifying American Civil War-era photos using facial
recognition and crowdsourcing. DoubleCheck focuses on improving CWPS's user
experience and system architecture to display information useful for assessing
the quality of historical photo IDs on CWPS. In a mixed-methods evaluation of
DoubleCheck, we found that users contributed a wide diversity of sources for
photo IDs, which helped facilitate the community's assessment of these IDs
through DoubleCheck's provenance visualizations. Further, DoubleCheck's quality
assessment badges and visualizations supported users in making accurate
assessments of photo IDs, even in cases involving ID conflicts.

<p class="mathjax">With ongoing development of autonomous driving systems and increasing desire
for deployment, researchers continue to seek reliable approaches for ADS
systems. The virtual simulation test (VST) has become a prominent approach for
testing autonomous driving systems (ADS) and advanced driver assistance systems
(ADAS) due to its advantages of fast execution, low cost, and high
repeatability. However, the success of these simulation-based experiments
heavily relies on the realism of the testing scenarios. It is needed to create
more flexible and high-fidelity testing scenarios in VST in order to increase
the safety and reliabilityof ADS and ADAS.To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the "Transfusor" model, which leverages the transformer and diffusor
models (two cutting-edge deep learning generative technologies). The primary
objective of the Transfusor model is to generate highly realistic and
controllable human-like lane-changing trajectories in highway scenarios.
Extensive experiments were carried out, and the results demonstrate that the
proposed model effectively learns the spatiotemporal characteristics of humans'
lane-changing behaviors and successfully generates trajectories that closely
mimic real-world human driving. As such, the proposed model can play a critical
role of creating more flexible and high-fidelity testing scenarios in the VST,
ultimately leading to safer and more reliable ADS and ADAS.

<p class="mathjax">Accelerated magnetic resonance imaging resorts to either Fourier-domain
subsampling or better reconstruction algorithms to deal with fewer measurements
while still generating medical images of high quality. Determining the optimal
sampling strategy given a fixed reconstruction protocol often has combinatorial
complexity. In this work, we apply double deep Q-learning and REINFORCE
algorithms to learn the sampling strategy for dynamic image reconstruction. We
consider the data in the format of time series, and the reconstruction method
is a pre-trained autoencoder-typed neural network. We present a proof of
concept that reinforcement learning algorithms are effective to discover the
optimal sampling pattern which underlies the pre-trained reconstructor network
(i.e., the dynamics in the environment). The code for replicating experiments
can be found at https://github.com/zhishenhuang/RLsamp.

<p class="mathjax">In order for autonomous mobile robots to navigate in human spaces, they must
abide by our social norms. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an
effective method to train robot navigation policies that are able to respect
these norms. However, a large portion of existing work in the field conducts
both RL training and testing in simplistic environments. This limits the
generalization potential of these models to unseen environments, and the
meaningfulness of their reported results. We propose a method to improve the
generalization performance of RL social navigation methods using curriculum
learning. By employing multiple environment types and by modeling pedestrians
using multiple dynamics models, we are able to progressively diversify and
escalate difficulty in training. Our results show that the use of curriculum
learning in training can be used to achieve better generalization performance
than previous training methods. We also show that results presented in many
existing state-of-the art RL social navigation works do not evaluate their
methods outside of their training environments, and thus do not reflect their
policies' failure to adequately generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. In
response, we validate our training approach on larger and more crowded testing
environments than those used in training, allowing for more meaningful
measurements of model performance.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference involve significant
challenges of scalability with respect to both model sizes and number of
layers, resulting in degradation of efficiency and accuracy for large and deep
GNNs. We present an end-to-end solution that aims to address these challenges
for efficient GNNs in resource constrained environments while avoiding the
oversmoothing problem in deep GNNs. We introduce a quantization based approach
for all stages of GNNs, from message passing in training to node
classification, compressing the model and enabling efficient processing. The
proposed GNN quantizer learns quantization ranges and reduces the model size
with comparable accuracy even under low-bit quantization. To scale with the
number of layers, we devise a message propagation mechanism in training that
controls layer-wise changes of similarities between neighboring nodes. This
objective is incorporated into a Lagrangian function with constraints and a
differential multiplier method is utilized to iteratively find optimal
embeddings. This mitigates oversmoothing and suppresses the quantization error
to a bound. Significant improvements are demonstrated over state-of-the-art
quantization methods and deep GNN approaches in both full-precision and
quantized models. The proposed quantizer demonstrates superior performance in
INT2 configurations across all stages of GNN, achieving a notable level of
accuracy. In contrast, existing quantization approaches fail to generate
satisfactory accuracy levels. Finally, the inference with INT2 and INT4
representations exhibits a speedup of 5.11 $\times$ and 4.70 $\times$ compared
to full precision counterparts, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Most state-of-the-art spoken language identification models are closed-set;
in other words, they can only output a language label from the set of classes
they were trained on. Open-set spoken language identification systems, however,
gain the ability to detect when an input exhibits none of the original
languages. In this paper, we implement a novel approach to open-set spoken
language identification that uses MFCC and pitch features, a TDNN model to
extract meaningful feature embeddings, confidence thresholding on softmax
outputs, and LDA and pLDA for learning to classify new unknown languages. We
present a spoken language identification system that achieves 91.76% accuracy
on trained languages and has the capability to adapt to unknown languages on
the fly. To that end, we also built the CU MultiLang Dataset, a large and
diverse multilingual speech corpus which was used to train and evaluate our
system.

<p class="mathjax">The uncertainties in material and other properties of structures are usually
spatially correlated. We introduce an efficient technique for representing and
processing spatially correlated random fields in robust topology optimisation
of lattice structures. Robust optimisation considers the statistics of the
structural response to obtain a design whose performance is less sensitive to
the specific realisation of the random field. We represent Gaussian random
fields on lattices by leveraging the established link between random fields and
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). It is known that the
precision matrix, i.e. the inverse of the covariance matrix, of a random field
with Mat\'ern covariance is equal to the finite element stiffness matrix of a
possibly fractional PDE with a second-order elliptic operator. We consider the
discretisation of the PDE on the lattice to obtain a random field which, by
design, considers its geometry and connectivity. The so-obtained random field
can be interpreted as a physics-informed prior by the hypothesis that the
elliptic SPDE models the physical processes occurring during manufacturing,
like heat and mass diffusion. Although the proposed approach is general, we
demonstrate its application to lattices modelled as pin-jointed trusses with
uncertainties in member Young's moduli. We consider as a cost function the
weighted sum of the expectation and standard deviation of the structural
compliance. To compute the expectation and standard deviation and their
gradients with respect to member cross-sections we use a first-order Taylor
series approximation. The cost function and its gradient are computed using
only sparse matrix operations. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
approach using several lattice examples with isotropic, anisotropic and
non-stationary random fields and up to eighty thousand random and optimisation
variables.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, prompt tuning has proven effective in adapting pre-trained
vision-language models to downstream tasks. These methods aim to adapt the
pre-trained models by introducing learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained
weights frozen. However, learnable prompts can affect the internal
representation within the self-attention module, which may negatively impact
performance variance and generalization, especially in data-deficient settings.
To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Read-only Prompt
Optimization (RPO). RPO leverages masked attention to prevent the internal
representation shift in the pre-trained model. Further, to facilitate the
optimization of RPO, the read-only prompts are initialized based on special
tokens of the pre-trained model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RPO
outperforms CLIP and CoCoOp in base-to-new generalization and domain
generalization while displaying better robustness. Also, the proposed method
achieves better generalization on extremely data-deficient settings, while
improving parameter efficiency and computational overhead. Code is available at
https://github.com/mlvlab/RPO.

property that every symbol of any codeword can be recovered from a small set of
other symbols. This property is particularly desirable in cloud storage
applications. A locally recoverable code is said to have availability $t$ if
each position has $t$ disjoint recovery sets. Hermitian-lifted codes are
locally recoverable codes with high availability first described by Lopez,

<p class="mathjax">In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for
compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data,
either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing an stage of exponential
growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing
and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical ``offline"
compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data
set, streaming compression algorithms compress data ``online" while the data
generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system.
This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well-suited for scientific
data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible.
This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy,
which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during
compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and
target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a
memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used
in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to
recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing
high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the
streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD
expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to
accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model
from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the
full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown
in the numerical tests.

<p class="mathjax">Human-robot interaction (HRI) is a rapidly growing field that encompasses
social and industrial applications. Machine learning plays a vital role in
industrial HRI by enhancing the adaptability and autonomy of robots in complex
environments. However, data privacy is a crucial concern in the interaction
between humans and robots, as companies need to protect sensitive data while
machine learning algorithms require access to large datasets. Federated
Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling the distributed training of models
without sharing raw data. Despite extensive research on Federated learning (FL)
for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP) and image classification,
the question of how to use FL for HRI remains an open research problem. The
traditional FL approach involves transmitting large neural network parameter
matrices between the server and clients, which can lead to high communication
costs and often becomes a bottleneck in FL. This paper proposes a
communication-efficient FL framework for human-robot interaction (CEFHRI) to
address the challenges of data heterogeneity and communication costs. The
framework leverages pre-trained models and introduces a trainable
spatiotemporal adapter for video understanding tasks in HRI. Experimental
results on three human-robot interaction benchmark datasets: HRI30, InHARD, and
COIN demonstrate the superiority of CEFHRI over full fine-tuning in terms of
communication costs. The proposed methodology provides a secure and efficient
approach to HRI federated learning, particularly in industrial environments
with data privacy concerns and limited communication bandwidth. Our code is

<p class="mathjax">Generative retrieval (GR) directly predicts the identifiers of relevant
documents (i.e., docids) based on a parametric model. It has achieved solid
performance on many ad-hoc retrieval tasks. So far, these tasks have assumed a
static document collection. In many practical scenarios, however, document
collections are dynamic, where new documents are continuously added to the
corpus. The ability to incrementally index new documents while preserving the
ability to answer queries with both previously and newly indexed relevant
documents is vital to applying GR models. In this paper, we address this
practical continual learning problem for GR. We put forward a novel
Continual-LEarner for generatiVE Retrieval (CLEVER) model and make two major
contributions to continual learning for GR: (i) To encode new documents into
docids with low computational cost, we present Incremental Product
Quantization, which updates a partial quantization codebook according to two
adaptive thresholds; and (ii) To memorize new documents for querying without
forgetting previous knowledge, we propose a memory-augmented learning
mechanism, to form meaningful connections between old and new documents.
Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
model.

<p class="mathjax">In the era of foundation models with huge pre-training budgets, the
downstream tasks have been shifted to the narrative of efficient and fast
adaptation. For classification-based tasks in the domain of computer vision,
the two most efficient approaches have been linear probing (LP) and visual
prompting/reprogramming (VP); the former aims to learn a classifier in the form
of a linear head on the features extracted by the pre-trained model, while the
latter maps the input data to the domain of the source data on which the model
was originally pre-trained on. Although extensive studies have demonstrated the
differences between LP and VP in terms of downstream performance, we explore
the capabilities of the two aforementioned methods via the sparsity axis: (a)
Data sparsity: the impact of few-shot adaptation and (b) Model sparsity: the
impact of lottery tickets (LT). We demonstrate that LT are not universal
reprogrammers, i.e., for certain target datasets, reprogramming an LT yields
significantly lower performance than the reprogrammed dense model although
their corresponding upstream performance is similar. Further, we demonstrate
that the calibration of dense models is always superior to that of their
lottery ticket counterparts under both LP and VP regimes. Our empirical study
opens a new avenue of research into VP for sparse models and encourages further
understanding of the performance beyond the accuracy achieved by VP under
constraints of sparsity. Code and logs can be accessed at

<p class="mathjax">Audio deepfake detection is an emerging active topic. A growing number of
literatures have aimed to study deepfake detection algorithms and achieved
effective performance, the problem of which is far from being solved. Although
there are some review literatures, there has been no comprehensive survey that
provides researchers with a systematic overview of these developments with a
unified evaluation. Accordingly, in this survey paper, we first highlight the
key differences across various types of deepfake audio, then outline and
analyse competitions, datasets, features, classifications, and evaluation of
state-of-the-art approaches. For each aspect, the basic techniques, advanced
developments and major challenges are discussed. In addition, we perform a
unified comparison of representative features and classifiers on ASVspoof 2021,
ADD 2023 and In-the-Wild datasets for audio deepfake detection, respectively.
The survey shows that future research should address the lack of large scale
datasets in the wild, poor generalization of existing detection methods to
unknown fake attacks, as well as interpretability of detection results.

<p class="mathjax">Deploying multiple robots for target search and tracking has many practical
applications, yet the challenge of planning over unknown or partially known
targets remains difficult to address. With recent advances in deep learning,
intelligent control techniques such as reinforcement learning have enabled
agents to learn autonomously from environment interactions with little to no
prior knowledge. Such methods can address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff
of planning over unknown targets in a data-driven manner, eliminating the
reliance on heuristics typical of traditional approaches and streamlining the
decision-making pipeline with end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose a
multi-agent reinforcement learning technique with target map building based on
distributed Gaussian process. We leverage the distributed Gaussian process to
encode belief over the target locations and efficiently plan over unknown
targets. We evaluate the performance and transferability of the trained policy
in simulation and demonstrate the method on a swarm of micro unmanned aerial
vehicles with hardware experiments.

<p class="mathjax">AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is an open industry standard
for the automotive sector. It defines the three-layered automotive software
architecture. One of these layers is the application layer, where functional
behaviors are encapsulated in Software Components (SW-Cs). Inside SW-Cs, a set
of runnable entities represents the internal behavior and is realized as a set
of tasks. To address AUTOSAR's lack of support for modeling behaviors of
runnables, languages such as Simulink are employed. Simulink simulations assume
Simulink block behaviors are completed in zero execution time, while real
execution requires a finite execution time. This timing mismatch can result in
failures to detect unexpected runtime behaviors during the simulation phase.
This paper extends the Simulink environment to model the timing properties of
tasks. We present a Simulink block that can schedule tasks with non-zero
simulation times. It enables a more realistic analysis during model
development.

<p class="mathjax">Document pre-trained models and grid-based models have proven to be very
effective on various tasks in Document AI. However, for the document layout
analysis (DLA) task, existing document pre-trained models, even those
pre-trained in a multi-modal fashion, usually rely on either textual features
or visual features. Grid-based models for DLA are multi-modality but largely
neglect the effect of pre-training. To fully leverage multi-modal information
and exploit pre-training techniques to learn better representation for DLA, in
this paper, we present VGT, a two-stream Vision Grid Transformer, in which Grid
Transformer (GiT) is proposed and pre-trained for 2D token-level and
segment-level semantic understanding. Furthermore, a new dataset named D$^4$LA,
which is so far the most diverse and detailed manually-annotated benchmark for
document layout analysis, is curated and released. Experiment results have
illustrated that the proposed VGT model achieves new state-of-the-art results
on DLA tasks, e.g. PubLayNet ($95.7\%$$\rightarrow$$96.2\%$), DocBank
($79.6\%$$\rightarrow$$84.1\%$), and D$^4$LA ($67.7\%$$\rightarrow$$68.8\%$).

<p class="mathjax">Given the prevalence of rolling bearing fault diagnosis as a practical issue
across various working conditions, the limited availability of samples
compounds the challenge. Additionally, the complexity of the external
environment and the structure of rolling bearings often manifests faults
characterized by randomness and fuzziness, hindering the effective extraction
of fault characteristics and restricting the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To
overcome these problems, this paper presents a novel approach termed
constructive Incremental learning-based ensemble domain adaptation (CIL-EDA)
approach. Specifically, it is implemented on stochastic configuration networks
(SCN) to constructively improve its adaptive performance in multi-domains.
Concretely, a cloud feature extraction method is employed in conjunction with
wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to capture the uncertainty of fault
information from multiple resolution aspects. Subsequently, constructive
Incremental learning-based domain adaptation (CIL-DA) is firstly developed to
enhance the cross-domain learning capability of each hidden node through domain
matching and construct a robust fault classifier by leveraging limited labeled
data from both target and source domains. Finally, fault diagnosis results are
obtained by a majority voting of CIL-EDA which integrates CIL-DA and parallel
ensemble learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our CIL-DA outperforms
several domain adaptation methods and CIL-EDA consistently outperforms
state-of-art fault diagnosis methods in few-shot scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a differential geometric control approach that leverages
SE(3) group invariance and equivariance to increase transferability in learning
robot manipulation tasks that involve interaction with the environment.
Specifically, we employ a control law and a learning representation framework
that remain invariant under arbitrary SE(3) transformations of the manipulation
task definition. Furthermore, the control law and learning representation
framework are shown to be SE(3) equivariant when represented relative to the
spatial frame. The proposed approach is based on utilizing a recently presented
geometric impedance control (GIC) combined with a learning variable impedance
control framework, where the gain scheduling policy is trained in a supervised
learning fashion from expert demonstrations. A geometrically consistent error
vector (GCEV) is fed to a neural network to achieve a gain scheduling policy
that remains invariant to arbitrary translation and rotations. A comparison of
our proposed control and learning framework with a well-known Cartesian space
learning impedance control, equipped with a Cartesian error vector-based gain
scheduling policy, confirms the significantly superior learning transferability
of our proposed approach. A hardware implementation on a peg-in-hole task is
conducted to validate the learning transferability and feasibility of the
proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the motion planning problem under uncertainty and address it
using probabilistic inference. A collision-free motion plan with linear
stochastic dynamics is modeled by a posterior distribution. Gaussian
variational inference is an optimization over the path distributions to infer
this posterior within the scope of Gaussian distributions. We propose Gaussian
Variational Inference Motion Planner (GVI-MP) algorithm to solve this Gaussian
inference, where a natural gradient paradigm is used to iteratively update the
Gaussian distribution, and the factorized structure of the joint distribution
is leveraged. We show that the direct optimization over the state distributions
in GVI-MP is equivalent to solving a stochastic control that has a closed-form
solution. Starting from this observation, we propose our second algorithm,
Proximal Gradient Covariance Steering Motion Planner (PGCS-MP), to solve the
same inference problem in its stochastic control form with terminal
constraints. We use a proximal gradient paradigm to solve the linear stochastic
control with nonlinear collision cost, where the nonlinear cost is iteratively
approximated using quadratic functions and a closed-form solution can be
obtained by solving a linear covariance steering at each iteration. We evaluate
the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed approaches through
extensive experiments on various robot models. The code for this paper can be
found in https://github.com/hzyu17/VIMP.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning aims to empower artificial intelligence (AI) with strong
adaptability to the real world. For this purpose, a desirable solution should
properly balance memory stability with learning plasticity, and acquire
sufficient compatibility to capture the observed distributions. Existing
advances mainly focus on preserving memory stability to overcome catastrophic
forgetting, but remain difficult to flexibly accommodate incremental changes as
biological intelligence (BI) does. By modeling a robust Drosophila learning
system that actively regulates forgetting with multiple learning modules, here
we propose a generic approach that appropriately attenuates old memories in
parameter distributions to improve learning plasticity, and accordingly
coordinates a multi-learner architecture to ensure solution compatibility.
Through extensive theoretical and empirical validation, our approach not only
clearly enhances the performance of continual learning, especially over
synaptic regularization methods in task-incremental settings, but also
potentially advances the understanding of neurological adaptive mechanisms,
serving as a novel paradigm to progress AI and BI together.

<p class="mathjax">The sixth-generation (6G) network is envisioned to shift its focus from the
service requirements of human beings' to those of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
devices'. Satellite communications are indispensable in 6G to support IoT
devices operating in rural or disastrous areas. However, satellite networks
face the inherent challenges of low data rate and large latency, which may not
support computation-intensive and delay-sensitive IoT applications. Mobile Edge
Computing (MEC) is a burgeoning paradigm by extending cloud computing
capabilities to the network edge. By utilizing MEC technologies, the
resource-limited IoT devices can access abundant computation resources with low
latency, which enables the highly demanding applications while meeting strict
delay requirements. Therefore, an integration of satellite communications and
MEC technologies is necessary to better enable 6G IoT. In this survey, we
provide a holistic overview of satellite-MEC integration. We first discuss the
main challenges of the integrated satellite-MEC network and propose three
minimal integrating structures. For each minimal structure, we summarize the
current advances in terms of their research topics, after which we discuss the
lessons learned and future directions of the minimal structure. Finally, we
outline potential research issues to envision a more intelligent, more secure,
and greener integrated satellite-MEC network.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of the trace reconstruction problem is to recover a string
$x\in\{0,1\}^n$ given many independent {\em traces} of $x$, where a trace is a
subsequence obtained from deleting bits of $x$ independently with some given
probability $p\in [0,1).$ A recent result of Chase (STOC 2021) shows how $x$
can be determined (in exponential time) from $\exp(\widetilde{O}(n^{1/5}))$
traces. This is the state-of-the-art result on the sample complexity of trace
reconstruction.
<br />In this paper we consider two kinds of algorithms for the trace
reconstruction problem.
<br />Our first, and technically more involved, result shows that any $k$-mer-based
algorithm for trace reconstruction must use $\exp(\Omega(n^{1/5}))$ traces,
under the assumption that the estimator requires $poly(2^k, 1/\varepsilon)$
traces, thus establishing the optimality of this number of traces. The analysis
of this result also shows that the analysis technique used by Chase (STOC 2021)
is essentially tight, and hence new techniques are needed in order to improve
the worst-case upper bound.
<br />Our second, simple, result considers the performance of the Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which specifically picks the source string that has
the maximum likelihood to generate the samples (traces). We show that the MLE
algorithm uses a nearly optimal number of traces, \ie, up to a factor of $n$ in
the number of samples needed for an optimal algorithm, and show that this
factor of $n$ loss may be necessary under general ``model estimation''
settings.

<p class="mathjax">The purpose of this paper is to develop an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
using a quadcopter with the capability of video surveillance, map coordinates,
a deployable parachute with a medicine kit or a food pack as a payload, a
collision warning system, remotely controlled, integrated with an android
application to assist in search and rescue operations.
<br />Applied research for the development of the functional prototype,
quantitative and descriptive statistics to summarize data by describing the
relationship between variables in a sample or population. The quadcopter
underwent an evaluation using a survey instrument to test its acceptability
using predefined variables to select respondents within Caloocan City and
Quezon City, Philippines.
<br />Demographic profiles and known issues and concerns were answered by 30
respondents. The results were summarized and distributed in Tables 1 and 2.
<br />In terms of demographic profiles, the number of SAR operators within the
specified areas is distributed equally, most are male, single, and within the
age bracket of 31 and above. In issues and concerns, the most common type of
search and rescue was ground search and rescue. Human error is the primary
cause of most injuries in operating units. The prototype was useful and
everyone agreed, in terms of acceptability, drone technology will improve
search and rescue operations.
<br />The innovative way of utilizing Android and drone technology is a new step
towards the improvement of SAR operations in the Philippines.
<br />The LiPo battery must be replaced with a higher capacity and the drone
operator should undergo a training course and secure a permit from the Civil
Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).

<p class="mathjax">Currently, style augmentation is capturing attention due to convolutional
neural networks (CNN) being strongly biased toward recognizing textures rather
than shapes. Most existing styling methods either perform a low-fidelity style
transfer or a weak style representation in the embedding vector. This paper
outlines a style augmentation algorithm using stochastic-based sampling with
noise addition to improving randomization on a general linear transformation
for style transfer. With our augmentation strategy, all models not only present
incredible robustness against image stylizing but also outperform all previous
methods and surpass the state-of-the-art performance for the STL-10 dataset. In
addition, we present an analysis of the model interpretations under different
style variations. At the same time, we compare comprehensive experiments
demonstrating the performance when applied to deep neural architectures in
training settings.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal knowledge graphs, representing the dynamic relationships and
interactions between entities over time, have been identified as a promising
approach for event forecasting. However, a limitation of most temporal
knowledge graph reasoning methods is their heavy reliance on the recurrence or
periodicity of events, which brings challenges to inferring future events
related to entities that lack historical interaction. In fact, the current
state of affairs is often the result of a combination of historical information
and underlying factors that are not directly observable. To this end, we
investigate the limits of historical information for temporal knowledge graph
extrapolation and propose a new event forecasting model called Contrastive
Event Network (CENET) based on a novel training framework of historical
contrastive learning. CENET learns both the historical and non-historical
dependency to distinguish the most potential entities that best match the given
query. Simultaneously, by launching contrastive learning, it trains
representations of queries to probe whether the current moment is more
dependent on historical or non-historical events. These representations further
help train a binary classifier, whose output is a boolean mask, indicating the
related entities in the search space. During the inference process, CENET
employs a mask-based strategy to generate the final results. We evaluate our
proposed model on five benchmark graphs. The results demonstrate that CENET
significantly outperforms all existing methods in most metrics, achieving at
least 8.3% relative improvement of Hits@1 over previous state-of-the-art
baselines on event-based datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Unlike cloud-based deep learning models that are often large and uniform,
edge-deployed models usually demand customization for domain-specific tasks and
resource-limited environments. Such customization processes can be costly and
time-consuming due to the diversity of edge scenarios and the training load for
each scenario. Although various approaches have been proposed for rapid
resource-oriented customization and task-oriented customization respectively,
achieving both of them at the same time is challenging. Drawing inspiration
from the generative AI and the modular composability of neural networks, we
introduce NN-Factory, an one-for-all framework to generate customized
lightweight models for diverse edge scenarios. The key idea is to use a
generative model to directly produce the customized models, instead of training
them. The main components of NN-Factory include a modular supernet with
pretrained modules that can be conditionally activated to accomplish different
tasks and a generative module assembler that manipulate the modules according
to task and sparsity requirements. Given an edge scenario, NN-Factory can
efficiently customize a compact model specialized in the edge task while
satisfying the edge resource constraints by searching for the optimal strategy
to assemble the modules. Based on experiments on image classification and
object detection tasks with different edge devices, NN-Factory is able to
generate high-quality task- and resource-specific models within few seconds,
faster than conventional model customization approaches by orders of magnitude.

<p class="mathjax">We present PBFormer, an efficient yet powerful scene text detector that
unifies the transformer with a novel text shape representation Polynomial Band
(PB). The representation has four polynomial curves to fit a text's top,
bottom, left, and right sides, which can capture a text with a complex shape by
varying polynomial coefficients. PB has appealing features compared with
conventional representations: 1) It can model different curvatures with a fixed
number of parameters, while polygon-points-based methods need to utilize a
different number of points. 2) It can distinguish adjacent or overlapping texts
as they have apparent different curve coefficients, while segmentation-based or
points-based methods suffer from adhesive spatial positions. PBFormer combines
the PB with the transformer, which can directly generate smooth text contours
sampled from predicted curves without interpolation. A parameter-free
cross-scale pixel attention (CPA) module is employed to highlight the feature
map of a suitable scale while suppressing the other feature maps. The simple
operation can help detect small-scale texts and is compatible with the
one-stage DETR framework, where no postprocessing exists for NMS. Furthermore,
PBFormer is trained with a shape-contained loss, which not only enforces the
piecewise alignment between the ground truth and the predicted curves but also
makes curves' positions and shapes consistent with each other. Without bells
and whistles about text pre-training, our method is superior to the previous
state-of-the-art text detectors on the arbitrary-shaped text datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot object detection aims to simultaneously localize and classify the
objects in an image with limited training samples. However, most existing
few-shot object detection methods focus on extracting the features of a few
samples of novel classes that lack diversity. Hence, they may not be sufficient
to capture the data distribution. To address that limitation, in this paper, we
propose a novel approach in which we train a generator to generate synthetic
data for novel classes. Still, directly training a generator on the novel class
is not effective due to the lack of novel data. To overcome that issue, we
leverage the large-scale dataset of base classes. Our overarching goal is to
train a generator that captures the data variations of the base dataset. We
then transform the captured variations into novel classes by generating
synthetic data with the trained generator. To encourage the generator to
capture data variations on base classes, we propose to train the generator with
an optimal transport loss that minimizes the optimal transport distance between
the distributions of real and synthetic data. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state
of the art. Source code will be available.

<p class="mathjax">The safe linear bandit problem is a version of the classic linear bandit
problem where the learner's actions must satisfy an uncertain linear constraint
at all rounds. Due its applicability to many real-world settings, this problem
has received considerable attention in recent years. We find that by exploiting
the geometry of the specific problem setting, we can achieve improved regret
guarantees for both well-separated problem instances and action sets that are
finite star convex sets. Additionally, we propose a novel algorithm for this
setting that chooses problem parameters adaptively and enjoys at least as good
regret guarantees as existing algorithms. Lastly, we introduce a generalization
of the safe linear bandit setting where the constraints are convex and adapt
our algorithms and analyses to this setting by leveraging a novel
convex-analysis based approach. Simulation results show improved performance

develop robot behavior while keeping the human user's preferences in mind.
Highly skilled human users doing delicate tasks require their robot partners to
behave according to their work habits and task constraints. To achieve this, we
present the use of the Optometrist's Algorithm (OA) to interactively and
intuitively personalize robot-human handovers. Using this algorithm, we tune
controller parameters for speed, location, and effort. We study the differences
in the fluency of the handovers before and after tuning and the subjective
perception of this process in a study of $N=30$ non-expert users of mixed
background -- evaluating the OA. The users evaluate the interaction on trust,
safety, and workload scales, amongst other measures. They assess our tuning
process to be engaging and easy to use. Personalization leads to an increase in
the fluency of the interaction. Our participants utilize the wide range of
parameters ending up with their unique personalized handover.

overcome some of the issues prevalent in the more established ECDSA standard.
Due to the EdDSA standard specifying that the EdDSA signature be deterministic,
if the signing function were to be used as a public key signing oracle for the
attacker, the unforgeability notion of security of the scheme can be broken.
This paper describes an attack against some of the most popular EdDSA
implementations, which results in an adversary recovering the private key used
during signing. With this recovered secret key, an adversary can sign arbitrary
messages that would be seen as valid by the EdDSA verification function. A list

Furthermore, this paper provides two suggestions for securing EdDSA signing

<p class="mathjax">Text classification is one of the most imperative tasks in natural language
processing (NLP). Recent advances with pre-trained language models (PLMs) have
shown remarkable success on this task. However, the satisfying results obtained
by PLMs heavily depend on the large amounts of task-specific labeled data,
which may not be feasible in many application scenarios due to data access and
privacy constraints. The recently-proposed prompt-based fine-tuning paradigm
improves the performance of PLMs for few-shot text classification with
task-specific templates. Yet, it is unclear how the prompting knowledge can be
transferred across tasks, for the purpose of mutual reinforcement. We propose
TransPrompt v2, a novel transferable prompting framework for few-shot learning
across similar or distant text classification tasks. For learning across
similar tasks, we employ a multi-task meta-knowledge acquisition (MMA)
procedure to train a meta-learner that captures the cross-task transferable
knowledge. For learning across distant tasks, we further inject the task type
descriptions into the prompt, and capture the intra-type and inter-type prompt
embeddings among multiple distant tasks. Additionally, two de-biasing
techniques are further designed to make the trained meta-learner more
task-agnostic and unbiased towards any tasks. After that, the meta-learner can
be adapted to each specific task with better parameters initialization.
Extensive experiments show that TransPrompt v2 outperforms single-task and
cross-task strong baselines over multiple NLP tasks and datasets. We further
show that the meta-learner can effectively improve the performance of PLMs on
previously unseen tasks. In addition, TransPrompt v2 also outperforms strong
fine-tuning baselines when learning with full training sets.

<p class="mathjax">The growth in data storage capacity and the increasing demands for high
performance have created several challenges for concurrent indexing structures.
One promising solution is learned indexes, which use a learning-based approach
to fit the distribution of stored data and predictively locate target keys,
significantly improving lookup performance. Despite their advantages,
prevailing learned indexes exhibit constraints and encounter issues of
scalability on multi-core data storage.
<br />This paper introduces SALI, the Scalable Adaptive Learned Index framework,
which incorporates two strategies aimed at achieving high scalability,
improving efficiency, and enhancing the robustness of the learned index.
Firstly, a set of node-evolving strategies is defined to enable the learned
index to adapt to various workload skews and enhance its concurrency
performance in such scenarios. Secondly, a lightweight strategy is proposed to
maintain statistical information within the learned index, with the goal of
further improving the scalability of the index. Furthermore, to validate their
effectiveness, SALI applied the two strategies mentioned above to the learned
index structure that utilizes fine-grained write locks, known as LIPP. The
experimental results have demonstrated that SALI significantly enhances the
insertion throughput with 64 threads by an average of 2.04x compared to the
second-best learned index. Furthermore, SALI accomplishes a lookup throughput
similar to that of LIPP+.

<p class="mathjax">With the surging popularity of approximate near-neighbor search (ANNS),
driven by advances in neural representation learning, the ability to serve
queries accompanied by a set of constraints has become an area of intense
interest. While the community has recently proposed several algorithms for
constrained ANNS, almost all of these methods focus on integration with
graph-based indexes, the predominant class of algorithms achieving
state-of-the-art performance in latency-recall tradeoffs. In this work, we take
a different approach and focus on developing a constrained ANNS algorithm via
space partitioning as opposed to graphs. To that end, we introduce Constrained
Approximate Partitioned Search (CAPS), an index for ANNS with filters via space
partitions that not only retains the benefits of a partition-based algorithm
but also outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based constrained search techniques
in recall-latency tradeoffs, with only 10% of the index size.

<p class="mathjax">Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for automatic digital avatar
animation. However, existing methods suffer from issues such as unstable
training and temporal inconsistency, particularly in generating high-fidelity
and comprehensive gestures. Additionally, these methods lack effective control
over speaker identity and temporal editing of the generated gestures. Focusing
on capturing temporal latent information and applying practical controlling, we
propose a Controllable Co-speech Gesture Generation framework, named C2G2.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage temporal dependency enhancement strategy
motivated by latent diffusion models. We further introduce two key features to
C2G2, namely a speaker-specific decoder to generate speaker-related real-length
skeletons and a repainting strategy for flexible gesture generation/editing.
Extensive experiments on benchmark gesture datasets verify the effectiveness of
our proposed C2G2 compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The link of

<p class="mathjax">Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) SAT solvers based on conflict-driven clause
learning (CDCL) have achieved remarkable engineering success, their sequential
nature limits the parallelism that may be extracted for acceleration on
platforms such as the graphics processing unit (GPU). In this work, we propose
FastFourierSAT, a highly parallel hybrid SAT solver based on gradient-driven
continuous local search (CLS). This is realized by a novel parallel algorithm
inspired by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based convolution for computing
the elementary symmetric polynomials (ESPs), which is the major computational
task in previous CLS methods. The complexity of our algorithm matches the best
previous result. Furthermore, the substantial parallelism inherent in our
algorithm can leverage the GPU for acceleration, demonstrating significant
improvement over the previous CLS approaches. We also propose to incorporate
the restart heuristics in CLS to improve search efficiency. We compare our
approach with the SOTA parallel SAT solvers on several benchmarks. Our results
show that FastFourierSAT computes the gradient 100+ times faster than previous
prototypes implemented on CPU. Moreover, FastFourierSAT solves most instances
and demonstrates promising performance on larger-size instances.

<p class="mathjax">Most open-domain dialogue systems suffer from forgetting important
information, especially in a long-term conversation. Existing works usually
train the specific retriever or summarizer to obtain key information from the
past, which is time-consuming and highly depends on the quality of labeled
data. To alleviate this problem, we propose to recursively generate summaries/
memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability.
Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue
contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and
following contexts. Finally, the LLM can easily generate a highly consistent
response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method using
ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, and the experiments on the widely-used public
dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a
long-context conversation. Notably, our method is a potential solution to
enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. Code and scripts will be
released later.

<p class="mathjax">Neural ranking methods based on large transformer models have recently gained
significant attention in the information retrieval community, and have been
adopted by major commercial solutions. Nevertheless, they are computationally
expensive to create, and require a great deal of labeled data for specialized
corpora. In this paper, we explore a low resource alternative which is a
bag-of-embedding model for document retrieval and find that it is competitive
with large transformer models fine tuned on information retrieval tasks. Our
results show that a simple combination of TF-IDF, a traditional keyword
matching method, with a shallow embedding model provides a low cost path to
compete well with the performance of complex neural ranking models on 3
datasets. Furthermore, adding TF-IDF measures improves the performance of
large-scale fine tuned models on these tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Mixture of experts (MoE) is a popular technique in deep learning that
improves model capacity with conditionally-activated parallel neural network
modules (experts). However, serving MoE models in resource-constrained
latency-critical edge scenarios is challenging due to the significantly
increased model size and complexity. In this paper, we first analyze the
behavior pattern of MoE models in continuous inference scenarios, which leads
to three key observations about the expert activations, including temporal
locality, exchangeability, and skippable computation. Based on these
observations, we introduce PC-MoE, an inference framework for
resource-constrained continuous MoE model serving. The core of PC-MoE is a new
data structure, Parameter Committee, that intelligently maintains a subset of
important experts in use to reduce resource consumption. The optimal
configuration of Parameter Committee is found offline by a profiling-guided
committee planner, and expert swapping and request handling at runtime are
managed by an adaptive committee scheduler. To evaluate the effectiveness of
PC-MoE, we conduct experiments using state-of-the-art MoE models on common
computer vision and natural language processing tasks. The results demonstrate
optimal trade-offs between resource consumption and model accuracy achieved by
PC-MoE. For instance, on object detection tasks with the Swin-MoE model, our
approach can reduce memory usage and latency by 42.34% and 18.63% with only
0.10% accuracy degradation.

<p class="mathjax">Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction holds a pivotal place in online
advertising and recommender systems since CTR prediction performance directly
influences the overall satisfaction of the users and the revenue generated by
companies. Even so, CTR prediction is still an active area of research since it
involves accurately modelling the preferences of users based on sparse and
high-dimensional features where the higher-order interactions of multiple
features can lead to different outcomes. Most CTR prediction models have relied
on a single fusion and interaction learning strategy. The few CTR prediction
models that have utilized multiple interaction modelling strategies have
treated each interaction to be self-contained. In this paper, we propose a
novel model named STEC that reaps the benefits of multiple interaction learning
approaches in a single unified architecture. Additionally, our model introduces
residual connections from different orders of interactions which boosts the
performance by allowing lower level interactions to directly affect the
predictions. Through extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that STEC outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for CTR
prediction thanks to its greater expressive capabilities.

enables efficient higher-order computations for tensor product splines. We aim
to transfer these concepts to immersed boundary methods, which perform
simulations on a regular background mesh cut by a boundary representation that
defines the domain of interest. Therefore, we present a novel concept to divide
the support of cut basis functions to obtain regular parts suited for sum
factorization. These regions require special discontinuous weighted quadrature
rules, while Gauss-like quadrature rules integrate the remaining support. Two
linear elasticity benchmark problems confirm the derived estimate for the
computational costs of the different integration routines and their
combination. Although the presence of cut elements reduces the speed-up, its
contribution to the overall computation time declines with h-refinement.

<p class="mathjax">Recognizing text lines from images is a challenging problem, especially for
handwritten documents due to large variations in writing styles. While text
line recognition models are generally trained on large corpora of real and
synthetic data, such models can still make frequent mistakes if the handwriting
is inscrutable or the image acquisition process adds corruptions, such as
noise, blur, compression, etc. Writing style is generally quite consistent for
an individual, which can be leveraged to correct mistakes made by such models.
Motivated by this, we introduce the problem of adapting text line recognition
models during test time. We focus on a challenging and realistic setting where,
given only a single test image consisting of multiple text lines, the task is
to adapt the model such that it performs better on the image, without any
labels. We propose an iterative self-training approach that uses feedback from
the language model to update the optical model, with confident self-labels in
each iteration. The confidence measure is based on an augmentation mechanism
that evaluates the divergence of the prediction of the model in a local region.
We perform rigorous evaluation of our method on several benchmark datasets as
well as their corrupted versions. Experimental results on multiple datasets
spanning multiple scripts show that the proposed adaptation method offers an
absolute improvement of up to 8% in character error rate with just a few
iterations of self-training at test time.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous robotic systems, like autonomous vehicles and robotic search and
rescue, require efficient on-device training for continuous adaptation of Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models in dynamic environments. This research is
fundamentally motivated by the need to understand and address the challenges of
on-device real-time DRL, which involves balancing timing and algorithm
performance under memory constraints, as exposed through our extensive
empirical studies. This intricate balance requires co-optimizing two pivotal
parameters of DRL training -- batch size and replay buffer size. Configuring
these parameters significantly affects timing and algorithm performance, while
both (unfortunately) require substantial memory allocation to achieve
near-optimal performance.
<br />This paper presents R^3, a holistic solution for managing timing, memory, and
algorithm performance in on-device real-time DRL training. R^3 employs (i) a
deadline-driven feedback loop with dynamic batch sizing for optimizing timing,
(ii) efficient memory management to reduce memory footprint and allow larger
replay buffer sizes, and (iii) a runtime coordinator guided by heuristic
analysis and a runtime profiler for dynamically adjusting memory resource
reservations. These components collaboratively tackle the trade-offs in
on-device DRL training, improving timing and algorithm performance while
minimizing the risk of out-of-memory (OOM) errors.
<br />We implemented and evaluated R^3 extensively across various DRL frameworks
and benchmarks on three hardware platforms commonly adopted by autonomous
robotic systems. Additionally, we integrate R^3 with a popular realistic
autonomous car simulator to demonstrate its real-world applicability.
Evaluation results show that R^3 achieves efficacy across diverse platforms,
ensuring consistent latency performance and timing predictability with minimal
overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Computing-in-Memory (CIM) has shown great potential for enhancing efficiency
and performance for deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the lack of
flexibility in CIM leads to an unnecessary expenditure of computational
resources on less critical operations, and a diminished Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) when handling more complex tasks, significantly hindering the overall
performance. Hence, we focus on the integration of CIM with Saliency-Aware
Computing -- a paradigm that dynamically tailors computing precision based on
the importance of each input. We propose On-the-fly Saliency-Aware Hybrid CIM
(OSA-HCIM) offering three primary contributions: (1) On-the-fly Saliency-Aware
(OSA) precision configuration scheme, which dynamically sets the precision of
each MAC operation based on its saliency, (2) Hybrid CIM Array (HCIMA), which
enables simultaneous operation of digital-domain CIM (DCIM) and analog-domain
CIM (ACIM) via split-port 6T SRAM, and (3) an integrated framework combining
OSA and HCIMA to fulfill diverse accuracy and power demands.
<br />Implemented on a 65nm CMOS process, OSA-HCIM demonstrates an exceptional
balance between accuracy and resource utilization. Notably, it is the first CIM
design to incorporate a dynamic digital-to-analog boundary, providing
unprecedented flexibility for saliency-aware computing. OSA-HCIM achieves a
1.95x enhancement in energy efficiency, while maintaining minimal accuracy loss
compared to DCIM when tested on CIFAR100 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">In this work we propose a method to perform optimization on manifolds. We
assume to have an objective function $f$ defined on a manifold and think of it
as the potential energy of a mechanical system. By adding a momentum-dependent
kinetic energy we define its Hamiltonian function, which allows us to write the
corresponding Hamiltonian system. We make it conformal by introducing a
dissipation term: the result is the continuous model of our scheme. We solve it
via splitting methods (Lie-Trotter and leapfrog): we combine the RATTLE scheme,
approximating the conserved flow, with the exact dissipated flow. The result is
a conformal symplectic method for constant stepsizes. We also propose an
adaptive stepsize version of it. We test it on an example, the minimization of
a function defined on a sphere, and compare it with the usual gradient descent
method.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we present an optimization framework for efficient motion
priority design between automated and teleoperated robots in an industrial
recovery scenario. Although robots have recently become increasingly common in
industrial sites, there are still challenges in achieving human-robot
collaboration/cooperation (HRC), where human workers and robots are engaged in
collaborative and cooperative tasks in a shared workspace. For example, the
corresponding factory cell must be suspended for safety when an industrial
robot drops an assembling part in the workspace. After that, a human worker is
allowed to enter the robot workspace to address the robot recovery. This
process causes non-continuous manufacturing, which leads to a productivity
reduction. Recently, robotic teleoperation technology has emerged as a
promising solution to enable people to perform tasks remotely and safely. This
technology can be used in the recovery process in manufacturing failure
scenarios. Our proposition involves the design of an appropriate priority
function that aids in collision avoidance between the manufacturing and
recovery robots and facilitates continuous processes with minimal production
loss within an acceptable risk level. This paper presents a framework,
including an HRC simulator and an optimization formulation, for finding optimal
parameters of the priority function. Through quantitative and qualitative
experiments, we address the proof of our novel concept and demonstrate its
feasibility.

<p class="mathjax">Rust is an emerging programming language designed for the development of
systems software. To facilitate the reuse of Rust code, crates.io, as a central
package registry of the Rust ecosystem, hosts thousands of third-party Rust
packages. The openness of crates.io enables the growth of the Rust ecosystem
but comes with security risks by severe security advisories. Although Rust
guarantees a software program to be safe via programming language features and
strict compile-time checking, the unsafe keyword in Rust allows developers to
bypass compiler safety checks for certain regions of code. Prior studies
empirically investigate the memory safety and concurrency bugs in the Rust
ecosystem, as well as the usage of unsafe keywords in practice. Nonetheless,
the literature lacks a systematic investigation of the security risks in the
Rust ecosystem.
<br />In this paper, we perform a comprehensive investigation into the security
risks present in the Rust ecosystem, asking ``what are the characteristics of
the vulnerabilities, what are the characteristics of the vulnerable packages,
and how are the vulnerabilities fixed in practice?''. To facilitate the study,
we first compile a dataset of 433 vulnerabilities, 300 vulnerable code
repositories, and 218 vulnerability fix commits in the Rust ecosystem, spanning
over 7 years. With the dataset, we characterize the types, life spans, and
evolution of the disclosed vulnerabilities. We then characterize the
popularity, categorization, and vulnerability density of the vulnerable Rust
packages, as well as their versions and code regions affected by the disclosed
vulnerabilities. Finally, we characterize the complexity of vulnerability fixes
and localities of corresponding code changes, and inspect how practitioners fix
vulnerabilities in Rust packages with various localities.

<p class="mathjax">Pose-free neural radiance fields (NeRF) aim to train NeRF with unposed
multi-view images and it has achieved very impressive success in recent years.
Most existing works share the pipeline of training a coarse pose estimator with
rendered images at first, followed by a joint optimization of estimated poses
and neural radiance field. However, as the pose estimator is trained with only
rendered images, the pose estimation is usually biased or inaccurate for real
images due to the domain gap between real images and rendered images, leading
to poor robustness for the pose estimation of real images and further local
minima in joint optimization. We design IR-NeRF, an innovative pose-free NeRF
that introduces implicit pose regularization to refine pose estimator with
unposed real images and improve the robustness of the pose estimation for real
images. With a collection of 2D images of a specific scene, IR-NeRF constructs
a scene codebook that stores scene features and captures the scene-specific
pose distribution implicitly as priors. Thus, the robustness of pose estimation
can be promoted with the scene priors according to the rationale that a 2D real
image can be well reconstructed from the scene codebook only when its estimated
pose lies within the pose distribution. Extensive experiments show that IR-NeRF
achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art
consistently across multiple synthetic and real datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Room layout estimation predicts layouts from a single panorama. It requires
datasets with large-scale and diverse room shapes to train the models. However,
there are significant imbalances in real-world datasets including the
dimensions of layout complexity, camera locations, and variation in scene
appearance. These issues considerably influence the model training performance.
In this work, we propose the imBalance-Aware Room Layout Estimation (iBARLE)
framework to address these issues. iBARLE consists of (1) Appearance Variation
Generation (AVG) module, which promotes visual appearance domain
generalization, (2) Complex Structure Mix-up (CSMix) module, which enhances
generalizability w.r.t. room structure, and (3) a gradient-based layout
objective function, which allows more effective accounting for occlusions in
complex layouts. All modules are jointly trained and help each other to achieve
the best performance. Experiments and ablation studies based on
ZInD~\cite{cruz2021zillow} dataset illustrate that iBARLE has state-of-the-art
performance compared with other layout estimation baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Although there have been remarkable advances in dialogue systems through the
dialogue systems technology competition (DSTC), it remains one of the key
challenges to building a robust task-oriented dialogue system with a speech
interface. Most of the progress has been made for text-based dialogue systems
since there are abundant datasets with written corpora while those with spoken
dialogues are very scarce. However, as can be seen from voice assistant systems
such as Siri and Alexa, it is of practical importance to transfer the success
to spoken dialogues. In this paper, we describe our engineering effort in
building a highly successful model that participated in the speech-aware
dialogue systems technology challenge track in DSTC11. Our model consists of
three major modules: (1) automatic speech recognition error correction to
bridge the gap between the spoken and the text utterances, (2) text-based
dialogue system (D3ST) for estimating the slots and values using slot
descriptions, and (3) post-processing for recovering the error of the estimated
slot value. Our experiments show that it is important to use an explicit
automatic speech recognition error correction module, post-processing, and data
augmentation to adapt a text-based dialogue state tracker for spoken dialogue
corpora.

<p class="mathjax">Morpheme glossing is a critical task in automated language documentation and
can benefit other downstream applications greatly. While state-of-the-art
glossing systems perform very well for languages with large amounts of existing
data, it is more difficult to create useful models for low-resource languages.
In this paper, we propose the use of a taxonomic loss function that exploits
morphological information to make morphological glossing more performant when
data is scarce. We find that while the use of this loss function does not
outperform a standard loss function with regards to single-label prediction
accuracy, it produces better predictions when considering the top-n predicted
labels. We suggest this property makes the taxonomic loss function useful in a
human-in-the-loop annotation setting.

<p class="mathjax">Objective.Visual-Brain Machine Interface(V-BMI) has provide a novel
interaction technique for Augmented Reality (AR) industries. Several
state-of-arts work has demonstates its high accuracy and real-time interaction
capbilities. However, most of the studies employ EEGs devices that are rigid
and difficult to apply in real-life AR glasseses application sceniraros. Here
we develop a consumer-tier Visual-Brain Machine Inteface(V-BMI) system
specialized for Augmented Reality(AR) glasses interactions. Approach. The
developed system consists of a wearable hardware which takes advantages of fast
set-up, reliable recording and comfortable wearable experience that
specificized for AR glasses applications. Complementing this hardware, we have
devised a software framework that facilitates real-time interactions within the
system while accommodating a modular configuration to enhance scalability. Main
results. The developed hardware is only 110g and 120x85x23 mm, which with 1
Tohm and peak to peak voltage is less than 1.5 uV, and a V-BMI based angry bird
game and an Internet of Thing (IoT) AR applications are deisgned, we
demonstrated such technology merits of intuitive experience and efficiency
interaction. The real-time interaction accuracy is between 85 and 96
percentages in a commercial AR glasses (DTI is 2.24s and ITR 65 bits-min ).
Significance. Our study indicates the developed system can provide an essential
hardware-software framework for consumer based V-BMI AR glasses. Also, we
derive several pivotal design factors for a consumer-grade V-BMI-based AR
system: 1) Dynamic adaptation of stimulation patterns-classification methods
via computer vision algorithms is necessary for AR glasses applications; and 2)
Algorithmic localization to foster system stability and latency reduction.

<p class="mathjax">[Context] The quality of requirements engineering artifacts, e.g.
requirements specifications, is acknowledged to be an important success factor
for projects. Therefore, many companies spend significant amounts of money to
control the quality of their RE artifacts. To reduce spending and improve the
RE artifact quality, methods were proposed that combine manual quality control,
i.e. reviews, with automated approaches. [Problem] So far, we have seen various
approaches to automatically detect certain aspects in RE artifacts. However, we
still lack an overview what can and cannot be automatically detected.
[Approach] Starting from an industry guideline for RE artifacts, we classify
166 existing rules for RE artifacts along various categories to discuss the
share and the characteristics of those rules that can be automated. For those
rules, that cannot be automated, we discuss the main reasons. [Contribution] We
estimate that 53% of the 166 rules can be checked automatically either
perfectly or with a good heuristic. Most rules need only simple techniques for
checking. The main reason why some rules resist automation is due to imprecise

<p class="mathjax">Relational datasets are widespread in real-world scenarios and are usually
delivered in a streaming fashion. This type of data stream can present unique
challenges, such as distribution drifts, outliers, emerging classes, and
changing features, which have recently been described as open environment
challenges for machine learning. While some work has been done on incremental
learning for data streams, their evaluations are mostly conducted with manually
partitioned datasets. Moreover, while several real-world streaming datasets are
available, it is uncertain whether these open environment challenges are
prevalent and how existing incremental learning algorithms perform on real
datasets. To fill this gap, we develop an Open Environment Benchmark named
OEBench to evaluate open environment challenges in relational data streams.
Specifically, we investigate 55 real-world streaming datasets and establish
that open environment scenarios are indeed widespread in real-world datasets,
which presents significant challenges for stream learning algorithms. Through
benchmarks, we find that increased data quantity may not consistently enhance
the model accuracy when applied in open environment scenarios, where machine
learning models can be significantly compromised by distribution shifts,
anomalies, or untrustworthy data within real-world data streams. The current
techniques are insufficient in effectively mitigating these challenges posed by
open environments. Thus, it is promising to conduct more researches to address
real-world new challenges of open environment scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is an important and
challenging task in intelligent video surveillance. Existing methods mainly
focus on learning a shared feature space to reduce the modality discrepancy
between visible and infrared modalities, which still leave two problems
underexplored: information redundancy and modality complementarity. To this
end, properly eliminating the identity-irrelevant information as well as making
up for the modality-specific information are critical and remains a challenging
endeavor. To tackle the above problems, we present a novel mutual information
and modality consensus network, namely CMInfoNet, to extract modality-invariant
identity features with the most representative information and reduce the
redundancies. The key insight of our method is to find an optimal
representation to capture more identity-relevant information and compress the
irrelevant parts by optimizing a mutual information bottleneck trade-off.
Besides, we propose an automatically search strategy to find the most prominent
parts that identify the pedestrians. To eliminate the cross- and intra-modality
variations, we also devise a modality consensus module to align the visible and
infrared modalities for task-specific guidance. Moreover, the global-local
feature representations can also be acquired for key parts discrimination.
Experimental results on four benchmarks, i.e., SYSU-MM01, RegDB,
Occluded-DukeMTMC, Occluded-REID, Partial-REID and Partial\_iLIDS dataset, have
demonstrated the effectiveness of CMInfoNet.

<p class="mathjax">Data augmentation methods are commonly integrated into the training of
anomaly detection models. Previous approaches have primarily focused on
replicating real-world anomalies or enhancing diversity, without considering
that the standard of anomaly varies across different classes, potentially
leading to a biased training distribution.This paper analyzes crucial traits of
simulated anomalies that contribute to the training of reconstructive networks
and condenses them into several methods, thus creating a comprehensive
framework by selectively utilizing appropriate combinations.Furthermore, we
integrate this framework with a reconstruction-based approach and concurrently
propose a split training strategy that alleviates the issue of overfitting
while avoiding introducing interference to the reconstruction process. The
evaluations conducted on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that
our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach, particularly in
terms of object classes.To evaluate generalizability, we generate a simulated
dataset comprising anomalies with diverse characteristics since the original
test samples only include specific types of anomalies and may lead to biased
evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits
promising potential for generalizing effectively to various unforeseen
anomalies encountered in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">The time-series anomaly detection is one of the most fundamental tasks for
time-series. Unlike the time-series forecasting and classification, the
time-series anomaly detection typically requires unsupervised (or
self-supervised) training since collecting and labeling anomalous observations
are difficult. In addition, most existing methods resort to limited forms of
anomaly measurements and therefore, it is not clear whether they are optimal in
all circumstances. To this end, we present a multivariate time-series anomaly
detector based on score-based generative models, called MadSGM, which considers
the broadest ever set of anomaly measurement factors: i) reconstruction-based,
ii) density-based, and iii) gradient-based anomaly measurements. We also design
a conditional score network and its denoising score matching loss for the
time-series anomaly detection. Experiments on five real-world benchmark
datasets illustrate that MadSGM achieves the most robust and accurate
predictions.

<p class="mathjax">We present DiffBIR, which leverages pretrained text-to-image diffusion models
for blind image restoration problem. Our framework adopts a two-stage pipeline.
In the first stage, we pretrain a restoration module across diversified
degradations to improve generalization capability in real-world scenarios. The
second stage leverages the generative ability of latent diffusion models, to
achieve realistic image restoration. Specifically, we introduce an injective
modulation sub-network -- LAControlNet for finetuning, while the pre-trained
Stable Diffusion is to maintain its generative ability. Finally, we introduce a
controllable module that allows users to balance quality and fidelity by
introducing the latent image guidance in the denoising process during
inference. Extensive experiments have demonstrated its superiority over
state-of-the-art approaches for both blind image super-resolution and blind
face restoration tasks on synthetic and real-world datasets. The code is

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks are susceptible to adversarial perturbations.
Adversarial training and adversarial purification are among the most widely
recognized defense strategies. Although these methods have different underlying
logic, both rely on absolute logit values to generate label predictions. In
this study, we theoretically analyze the logit difference around successful
adversarial attacks from a theoretical point of view and propose a new
principle, namely Adversarial Logit Update (ALU), to infer adversarial sample's
labels. Based on ALU, we introduce a new classification paradigm that utilizes
pre- and post-purification logit differences for model's adversarial robustness
boost. Without requiring adversarial or additional data for model training, our
clean data synthesis model can be easily applied to various pre-trained models
for both adversarial sample detection and ALU-based data classification.
Extensive experiments on both CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tiny-ImageNet datasets
show that even with simple components, the proposed solution achieves superior
robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art methods against a wide
range of adversarial attacks. Our python implementation is submitted in our
Supplementary document and will be published upon the paper's acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Transfer learning has become crucial in computer vision tasks due to the vast
availability of pre-trained deep learning models. However, selecting the
optimal pre-trained model from a diverse pool for a specific downstream task
remains a challenge. Existing methods for measuring the transferability of
pre-trained models rely on statistical correlations between encoded static
features and task labels, but they overlook the impact of underlying
representation dynamics during fine-tuning, leading to unreliable results,
especially for self-supervised models. In this paper, we present an insightful
physics-inspired approach named PED to address these challenges. We reframe the
challenge of model selection through the lens of potential energy and directly
model the interaction forces that influence fine-tuning dynamics. By capturing
the motion of dynamic representations to decline the potential energy within a
force-driven physical model, we can acquire an enhanced and more stable
observation for estimating transferability. The experimental results on 10
downstream tasks and 12 self-supervised models demonstrate that our approach
can seamlessly integrate into existing ranking techniques and enhance their
performances, revealing its effectiveness for the model selection task and its
potential for understanding the mechanism in transfer learning. Code will be
available at https://github.com/lixiaotong97/PED.

connectivity, they bring new possibilities for Connected, Cooperative and
Automated Mobility (CCAM) services that exploit local and global data for a

<p class="mathjax">Next-generation edge intelligence is anticipated to bring huge benefits to
various applications, e.g., offloading systems. However, traditional deep
offloading architectures face several issues, including heterogeneous
constraints, partial perception, uncertain generalization, and lack of
tractability. In this context, the integration of offloading with large
language models (LLMs) presents numerous advantages. Therefore, we propose an
LLM-Based Offloading (LAMBO) framework for mobile edge computing (MEC), which
comprises four components: (i) Input embedding (IE), which is used to represent
the information of the offloading system with constraints and prompts through
learnable vectors with high quality; (ii) Asymmetric encoderdecoder (AED)
model, which is a decision-making module with a deep encoder and a shallow
decoder. It can achieve high performance based on multi-head self-attention
schemes; (iii) Actor-critic reinforcement learning (ACRL) module, which is
employed to pre-train the whole AED for different optimization tasks under
corresponding prompts; and (iv) Active learning from expert feedback (ALEF),
which can be used to finetune the decoder part of the AED while adapting to
dynamic environmental changes. Our simulation results corroborate the
advantages of the proposed LAMBO framework.

<p class="mathjax">Modular reduction is a crucial operation in many post-quantum cryptographic
schemes, including the Kyber key exchange method or Dilithium signature scheme.
However, it can be computationally expensive and pose a performance bottleneck
in hardware implementations. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach
for computing modular reduction efficiently in hardware for arbitrary static
moduli. Unlike other commonly used methods such as Barrett or Montgomery
reduction, the method does not require any multiplications. It is not dependent
on properties of any particular choice of modulus for good performance and low
area consumption. Its major strength lies in its low area consumption, which
was reduced by 60% for optimized and up to 90% for generic Barrett
implementations for Kyber and Dilithium. Additionally, it is well suited for
parallelization and pipelining and scales linearly in hardware resource
consumption with increasing operation width. All operations can be performed in
the bit-width of the modulus, rather than the size of the number being reduced.
This shortens carry chains and allows for faster clocking. Moreover, our method
can be executed in constant time, which is essential for cryptography
applications where timing attacks can be used to obtain information about the
secret key.

<p class="mathjax">Positive-unlabeled learning (PU learning) in hyperspectral remote sensing
imagery (HSI) is aimed at learning a binary classifier from positive and
unlabeled data, which has broad prospects in various earth vision applications.
However, when PU learning meets limited labeled HSI, the unlabeled data may
dominate the optimization process, which makes the neural networks overfit the
unlabeled data. In this paper, a Taylor variational loss is proposed for HSI PU
learning, which reduces the weight of the gradient of the unlabeled data by
Taylor series expansion to enable the network to find a balance between
overfitting and underfitting. In addition, the self-calibrated optimization
strategy is designed to stabilize the training process. Experiments on 7
benchmark datasets (21 tasks in total) validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Code is at: https://github.com/Hengwei-Zhao96/T-HOneCls.

<p class="mathjax">Software architecture optimization aims to enhance non-functional attributes
like performance and reliability while meeting functional requirements.
Multi-objective optimization employs metaheuristic search techniques, such as
genetic algorithms, to explore feasible architectural changes and propose
alternatives to designers. However, the resource-intensive process may not
always align with practical constraints. This study investigates the impact of
designer interactions on multi-objective software architecture optimization.
Designers can intervene at intermediate points in the fully automated
optimization process, making choices that guide exploration towards more
desirable solutions. We compare this interactive approach with the fully
automated optimization process, which serves as the baseline. The findings
demonstrate that designer interactions lead to a more focused solution space,
resulting in improved architectural quality. By directing the search towards
regions of interest, the interaction uncovers architectures that remain
unexplored in the fully automated process.

<p class="mathjax">We present DySample, an ultra-lightweight and effective dynamic upsampler.
While impressive performance gains have been witnessed from recent kernel-based
dynamic upsamplers such as CARAFE, FADE, and SAPA, they introduce much
workload, mostly due to the time-consuming dynamic convolution and the
additional sub-network used to generate dynamic kernels. Further, the need for
high-res feature guidance of FADE and SAPA somehow limits their application
scenarios. To address these concerns, we bypass dynamic convolution and
formulate upsampling from the perspective of point sampling, which is more
resource-efficient and can be easily implemented with the standard built-in
function in PyTorch. We first showcase a naive design, and then demonstrate how
to strengthen its upsampling behavior step by step towards our new upsampler,
DySample. Compared with former kernel-based dynamic upsamplers, DySample
requires no customized CUDA package and has much fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU
memory, and latency. Besides the light-weight characteristics, DySample
outperforms other upsamplers across five dense prediction tasks, including
semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic
segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Code is available at
https://github.com/tiny-smart/dysample.

<p class="mathjax">We establish optimal error bounds on time-splitting methods for the nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation with low regularity potential and typical power-type
nonlinearity $ f(\rho) = \rho^\sigma $, where $ \rho:=|\psi|^2 $ is the density
with $ \psi $ the wave function and $ \sigma &gt; 0 $ the exponent of the
nonlinearity. For the first-order Lie-Trotter time-splitting method, optimal $
L^2 $-norm error bound is proved for $L^\infty$-potential and $ \sigma &gt; 0 $,
and optimal $H^1$-norm error bound is obtained for $ W^{1, 4} $-potential and $
\sigma \geq 1/2 $. For the second-order Strang time-splitting method, optimal $
L^2 $-norm error bound is established for $H^2$-potential and $ \sigma \geq 1
$, and optimal $H^1$-norm error bound is proved for $H^3$-potential and $
\sigma \geq 3/2 $. Compared to those error estimates of time-splitting methods
in the literature, our optimal error bounds either improve the convergence
rates under the same regularity assumptions or significantly relax the
regularity requirements on potential and nonlinearity for optimal convergence
orders. A key ingredient in our proof is to adopt a new technique called
\textit{regularity compensation oscillation} (RCO), where low frequency modes
are analyzed by phase cancellation, and high frequency modes are estimated by
regularity of the solution. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm
our error estimates and to demonstrate that they are sharp.

<p class="mathjax">Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) aims to develop systems capable of
describing an audio recording using a textual sentence. In contrast, Audio-Text
Retrieval (ATR) systems seek to find the best matching audio recording(s) for a
given textual query (Text-to-Audio) or vice versa (Audio-to-Text). These tasks
require different types of systems: AAC employs a sequence-to-sequence model,
while ATR utilizes a ranking model that compares audio and text representations
within a shared projection subspace. However, this work investigates the
relationship between AAC and ATR by exploring the ATR capabilities of an
unmodified AAC system, without fine-tuning for the new task. Our AAC system
consists of an audio encoder (ConvNeXt-Tiny) trained on AudioSet for audio
tagging, and a transformer decoder responsible for generating sentences. For
AAC, it achieves a high SPIDEr-FL score of 0.298 on Clotho and 0.472 on
AudioCaps on average. For ATR, we propose using the standard Cross-Entropy loss
values obtained for any audio/caption pair. Experimental results on the Clotho
and AudioCaps datasets demonstrate decent recall values using this simple
approach. For instance, we obtained a Text-to-Audio R@1 value of 0.382 for
Au-dioCaps, which is above the current state-of-the-art method without external
data. Interestingly, we observe that normalizing the loss values was necessary
for Audio-to-Text retrieval.

<p class="mathjax">As deep learning predictive models become an integral part of a large
spectrum of precision agricultural systems, a barrier to the adoption of such
automated solutions is the lack of user trust in these highly complex, opaque
and uncertain models. Indeed, deep neural networks are not equipped with any
explicit guarantees that can be used to certify the system's performance,
especially in highly varying uncontrolled environments such as the ones
typically faced in computer vision for agriculture.Fortunately, certain methods
developed in other communities can prove to be important for agricultural
applications. This article presents the conformal prediction framework that
provides valid statistical guarantees on the predictive performance of any
black box prediction machine, with almost no assumptions, applied to the
problem of deep visual classification of weeds and crops in real-world
conditions. The framework is exposed with a focus on its practical aspects and
special attention accorded to the Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) approach that
delivers marginal guarantees on the model's coverage. Marginal results are then
shown to be insufficient to guarantee performance on all groups of individuals
in the population as characterized by their environmental and pedo-climatic
auxiliary data gathered during image acquisition.To tackle this shortcoming,
group-conditional conformal approaches are presented: the ''classical'' method
that consists of iteratively applying the APS procedure on all groups, and a
proposed elegant reformulation and implementation of the procedure using
quantile regression on group membership indicators. Empirical results showing
the validity of the proposed approach are presented and compared to the
marginal APS then discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchain has become a popular decentralized paradigm for various
applications in the zero-trust environment. The core of the blockchain is the
consensus protocol, which establishes consensus among all the participants. PoW
(Proof-of-Work) is one of the most popular consensus protocols. However, the
PoW consensus protocol which incentives the participants to use their computing
power to solve a meaningless hash puzzle is continuously questioned as
energy-wasting. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and secure
consensus protocol based on proof of useful federated learning for blockchain
(called FedChain). We first propose a secure and robust blockchain architecture
that takes federated learning tasks as proof of work. Then a pool aggregation
mechanism is integrated to improve the efficiency of the FedChain architecture.
To protect model parameter privacy for each participant within a mining pool, a
secret sharing-based ring-all reduce architecture is designed. We also
introduce a data distribution-based federated learning model optimization
algorithm to improve the model performance of FedChain. At last, a
zero-knowledge proof-based federated learning model verification is introduced
to preserve the privacy of federated learning participants while proving the
model performance of federated learning participants. Our approach has been
tested and validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Consider an arbitrary network of communicating modules on a chip, each
requiring a local signal telling it when to execute a computational step. There
are three common solutions to generating such a local clock signal: (i) by
deriving it from a single, central clock source, (ii) by local, free-running
oscillators, or (iii) by handshaking between neighboring modules. Conceptually,
each of these solutions is the result of a perceived dichotomy in which
(sub)systems are either clocked or asynchronous. We present a solution and its
implementation that lies between these extremes. Based on a distributed
gradient clock synchronization algorithm, we show a novel design providing
modules with local clocks, the frequency bounds of which are almost as good as
those of free-running oscillators, yet neighboring modules are guaranteed to
have a phase offset substantially smaller than one clock cycle. Concretely,
parameters obtained from a 15nm ASIC simulation running at 2GHz yield
mathematical worst-case bounds of 20ps on the phase offset for a $32 \times 32$
node grid network.

<p class="mathjax">Interpretability is often pointed out as a key requirement for trustworthy
machine learning. However, learning and releasing models that are inherently
interpretable leaks information regarding the underlying training data. As such
disclosure may directly conflict with privacy, a precise quantification of the
privacy impact of such breach is a fundamental problem. For instance, previous
work have shown that the structure of a decision tree can be leveraged to build
a probabilistic reconstruction of its training dataset, with the uncertainty of
the reconstruction being a relevant metric for the information leak. In this
paper, we propose of a novel framework generalizing these probabilistic
reconstructions in the sense that it can handle other forms of interpretable
models and more generic types of knowledge. In addition, we demonstrate that
under realistic assumptions regarding the interpretable models' structure, the
uncertainty of the reconstruction can be computed efficiently. Finally, we
illustrate the applicability of our approach on both decision trees and rule
lists, by comparing the theoretical information leak associated to either exact
or heuristic learning algorithms. Our results suggest that optimal
interpretable models are often more compact and leak less information regarding
their training data than greedily-built ones, for a given accuracy level.

<p class="mathjax">The Automatic Dependant Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) message scheme was
designed without any authentication or encryption of messages in place. It is
therefore easily possible to attack it, e.g., by injecting spoofed messages or
modifying the transmitted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
coordinates. In order to verify the integrity of the received information,
various methods have been suggested, such as multilateration, the use of Kalman
filters, group certification, and many others. However, solutions based on
modifications of the standard may be difficult and too slow to be implemented
due to legal and regulatory issues. A vantage far less explored is the location
verification using public sensor data. In this paper, we propose LoVe, a
lightweight message verification approach that uses a geospatial indexing
scheme to evaluate the trustworthiness of publicly deployed sensors and the
ADS-B messages they receive. With LoVe, new messages can be evaluated with
respect to the plausibility of their reported coordinates in a location
privacy-preserving manner, while using a data-driven and lightweight approach.
By testing our approach on two open datasets, we show that LoVe achieves very
low false positive rates (between 0 and 0.00106) and very low false negative
rates (between 0.00065 and 0.00334) while providing a real-time compatible
approach that scales well even with a large sensor set. Compared to currently
existing approaches, LoVe neither requires a large number of sensors, nor for
messages to be recorded by as many sensors as possible simultaneously in order
to verify location claims. Furthermore, it can be directly applied to currently
deployed systems thus being backward compatible.

function space and graph feedback. We propose an algorithm that addresses this
problem by adapting to both the underlying graph structures and reward gaps. To
the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first to provide a
gap-dependent upper bound in this stochastic setting, bridging the research gap
left by the work in [35]. In comparison to [31,33,35], our method offers
improved regret upper bounds and does not require knowledge of graphical
quantities. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the computational
efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in terms of regret upper bounds.
These findings highlight the significance of our algorithm in advancing the
field of stochastic contextual bandits with graph feedback, opening up avenues
for practical applications in various domains.

<p class="mathjax">Video moment retrieval is a fundamental visual-language task that aims to
retrieve target moments from an untrimmed video based on a language query.
Existing methods typically generate numerous proposals manually or via
generative networks in advance as the support set for retrieval, which is not
only inflexible but also time-consuming. Inspired by the success of diffusion
models on object detection, this work aims at reformulating video moment
retrieval as a denoising generation process to get rid of the inflexible and
time-consuming proposal generation. To this end, we propose a novel
proposal-free framework, namely DiffusionVMR, which directly samples random
spans from noise as candidates and introduces denoising learning to ground
target moments. During training, Gaussian noise is added to the real moments,
and the model is trained to learn how to reverse this process. In inference, a
set of time spans is progressively refined from the initial noise to the final
output. Notably, the training and inference of DiffusionVMR are decoupled, and
an arbitrary number of random spans can be used in inference without being
consistent with the training phase. Extensive experiments conducted on three
widely-used benchmarks (i.e., QVHighlight, Charades-STA, and TACoS) demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DiffusionVMR by comparing it with
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">The design of effective memory architecture is of utmost importance in modern
computing systems. However, the design of memory subsystems is even more
difficult today because process variation and modern design techniques like
dynamic voltage scaling make performance metrics for memory assessment be
treated as random variables instead of scalars at design time. Most of the
previous works have studied the design of memory design from the yield analysis
perspective leaving the question of the best memory organization on average
open. Because examining all possible combinations of design parameter values of
a memory chip would require prohibitively much time, in this work, we propose
Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms to accelerate the exploration for the
best memory architecture on average under parameter variations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that we can arrive at the best memory
organization 99% of the time in x5 faster than an exhaustive search of all
possible conditions.

studying biomolecules. At the same time, it is desirable to perform simulations
of a collection of particles under various conditions in which the molecules
can fluctuate. In this paper, we explore and adapt the soft prompt-based
learning method to molecular dynamics tasks. Our model can remarkably
generalize to unseen and out-of-distribution scenarios with limited training
data. While our work focuses on temperature as a test case, the versatility of
our approach allows for efficient simulation through any continuous dynamic
conditions, such as pressure and volumes. Our framework has two stages: 1)
Pre-trains with data mixing technique, augments molecular structure data and
temperature prompts, then applies a curriculum learning method by increasing
the ratio of them smoothly. 2) Meta-learning-based fine-tuning framework
improves sample-efficiency of fine-tuning process and gives the soft
prompt-tuning better initialization points. Comprehensive experiments reveal
that our framework excels in accuracy for in-domain data and demonstrates
strong generalization capabilities for unseen and out-of-distribution samples.

It proposes a three-part classification of these teachers, by orientation,

<p class="mathjax">Dynamically scheduled high-level synthesis (HLS) achieves higher throughput
than static HLS for codes with unpredictable memory accesses and control flow.
However, excessive dataflow scheduling results in circuits that use more
resources and have a slower critical path, even when only a part of the circuit
exhibits dynamic behavior. Recent work has shown that marking parts of a
dataflow circuit for static scheduling can save resources and improve
performance (hybrid scheduling), but the dynamic part of the circuit still
bottlenecks the critical path. We propose instead to selectively introduce
dynamic scheduling into static HLS. This paper presents an algorithm for
identifying code regions amenable to dynamic scheduling and shows a methodology
for introducing dynamically scheduled basic blocks, loops, and memory
operations into static HLS. Our algorithm is informed by modulo-scheduling and
can be integrated into any modulo-scheduled HLS tool. On a set of ten
benchmarks, we show that our approach achieves on average an up to 3.7$\times$
and 3$\times$ speedup against dynamic and hybrid scheduling, respectively, with
an area overhead of 1.3$\times$ and frequency degradation of 0.74$\times$ when
compared to static HLS.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising avenue to implement deep
neural networks in a more energy-efficient way. However, the network
architectures of existing SNNs for language tasks are too simplistic, and deep
architectures have not been fully explored, resulting in a significant
performance gap compared to mainstream transformer-based networks such as BERT.
To this end, we improve a recently-proposed spiking transformer (i.e.,
Spikformer) to make it possible to process language tasks and propose a
two-stage knowledge distillation method for training it, which combines
pre-training by distilling knowledge from BERT with a large collection of
unlabelled texts and fine-tuning with task-specific instances via knowledge
distillation again from the BERT fine-tuned on the same training examples.
Through extensive experimentation, we show that the models trained with our
method, named SpikeBERT, outperform state-of-the-art SNNs and even achieve
comparable results to BERTs on text classification tasks for both English and
Chinese with much less energy consumption.

<p class="mathjax">Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
success. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the hallucination problem, which
limits the practicality in many scenarios. Hallucination refers to the
information of LVLMs' responses that does not exist in the visual input, which
poses potential risks of substantial consequences. There has been limited work
studying hallucination evaluation in LVLMs. In this paper, we propose
Hallucination Evaluation based on Large Language Models (HaELM), an LLM-based
hallucination evaluation framework. HaELM achieves an approximate 95%
performance comparable to ChatGPT and has additional advantages including low
cost, reproducibility, privacy preservation and local deployment. Leveraging
the HaELM, we evaluate the hallucination in current LVLMs. Furthermore, we
analyze the factors contributing to hallucination in LVLMs and offer helpful
suggestions to mitigate the hallucination problem. Our training data and human
annotation hallucination data will be made public soon.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a robust transceiver design for a covert integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) system with imperfect channel state information (CSI).
Considering both bounded and probabilistic CSI error models, we formulate
worst-case and outage-constrained robust optimization problems of joint
trasceiver beamforming and radar waveform design to balance the radar
performance of multiple targets while ensuring communications performance and
covertness of the system. The optimization problems are challenging due to the
non-convexity arising from the semi-infinite constraints (SICs) and the coupled
transceiver variables. In an effort to tackle the former difficulty,
S-procedure and Bernstein-type inequality are introduced for converting the
SICs into finite convex linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and second-order cone
constraints. A robust alternating optimization framework referred to
alternating double-checking is developed for decoupling the transceiver design
problem into feasibility-checking transmitter- and receiver-side subproblems,
transforming the rank-one constraints into a set of LMIs, and verifying the
feasibility of beamforming by invoking the matrix-lifting scheme. Numerical
results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed algorithm in improving the performance of covert ISAC systems.

<p class="mathjax">Training machine learning models from data with weak supervision and dataset
shifts is still challenging. Designing algorithms when these two situations
arise has not been explored much, and existing algorithms cannot always handle
the most complex distributional shifts. We think the biquality data setup is a
suitable framework for designing such algorithms. Biquality Learning assumes
that two datasets are available at training time: a trusted dataset sampled
from the distribution of interest and the untrusted dataset with dataset shifts
and weaknesses of supervision (aka distribution shifts). The trusted and
untrusted datasets available at training time make designing algorithms dealing
with any distribution shifts possible. We propose two methods, one inspired by
the label noise literature and another by the covariate shift literature for
biquality learning. We experiment with two novel methods to synthetically
introduce concept drift and class-conditional shifts in real-world datasets
across many of them. We opened some discussions and assessed that developing
biquality learning algorithms robust to distributional changes remains an
interesting problem for future research.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel GPS-aided visual-wheel odometry (GPS-VWO) for
ground robots. The state estimation algorithm tightly fuses visual, wheeled
encoder and GPS measurements in the way of Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter
(MSCKF). To avoid accumulating calibration errors over time, the proposed
algorithm calculates the extrinsic rotation parameter between the GPS global
coordinate frame and the VWO reference frame online as part of the estimation
process. The convergence of this extrinsic parameter is guaranteed by the
observability analysis and verified by using real-world visual and wheel
encoder measurements as well as simulated GPS measurements. Moreover, a novel
theoretical finding is presented that the variance of unobservable state could
converge to zero for specific Kalman filter system. We evaluate the proposed
system extensively in large-scale urban driving scenarios. The results
demonstrate that better accuracy than GPS is achieved through the fusion of GPS
and VWO. The comparison between extrinsic parameter calibration and
non-calibration shows significant improvement in localization accuracy thanks
to the online calibration.

<p class="mathjax">Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in various
disciplines spanning data mining and artificial intelligence, from information
retrieval and computer vision to natural language processing and recommender
systems. Data volumes have soared in recent years and the computational cost of
an exhaustive exact nearest neighbor search is often prohibitive, necessitating
the adoption of approximate techniques. The balanced performance and recall of
graph-based approaches have more recently garnered significant attention in
ANNS algorithms, however, only a few studies have explored harnessing the power
of GPUs and multi-core processors despite the widespread use of massively
parallel and general-purpose computing. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
novel parallel computing hardware-based proximity graph and search algorithm.
By leveraging the high-performance capabilities of modern hardware, our
approach achieves remarkable efficiency gains. In particular, our method
surpasses existing CPU and GPU-based methods in constructing the proximity
graph, demonstrating higher throughput in both large- and small-batch searches
while maintaining compatible accuracy. In graph construction time, our method,
CAGRA, is 2.2~27x faster than HNSW, which is one of the CPU SOTA
implementations. In large-batch query throughput in the 90% to 95% recall
range, our method is 33~77x faster than HNSW, and is 3.8~8.8x faster than the
SOTA implementations for GPU. For a single query, our method is 3.4~53x faster
than HNSW at 95% recall.

<p class="mathjax">As recent advances in AI are causing the decline of conventional diagnostic
methods, the realization of end-to-end diagnosis is fast approaching.
Ultrasound image segmentation is an important step in the diagnostic process.
An accurate and robust segmentation model accelerates the process and reduces
the burden of sonographers. In contrast to previous research, we take two
inherent features of ultrasound images into consideration: (1) different organs
and tissues vary in spatial sizes, (2) the anatomical structures inside human
body form a relatively constant spatial relationship. Based on those two ideas,
we propose a new image segmentation model combining Feature Pyramid Network
(FPN) and Spatial Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN). We discuss why we use FPN to
extract anatomical structures of different scales and how SRNN is implemented
to extract the spatial context features in abdominal ultrasound images.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchains are decentralized and immutable databases that are shared among
the nodes of the network. Although blockchains have attracted a great scale of
attention in the recent years by disrupting the traditional financial systems,
the transaction privacy is still a challenging issue that needs to be addressed
and analysed. We propose a Private Token Transfer System (PTTS) for the
Ethereum public blockchain in the first part of this paper. For the proposed
framework, zero-knowledge based protocol has been designed using Zokrates and
integrated into our private token smart contract. With the help of web user
interface designed, the end users can interact with the smart contract without
any third-party setup. In the second part of the paper, we provide security and
privacy analysis including the replay attack and the balance range privacy
attack which has been modelled as a network flow problem. It is shown that in
case some balance ranges are deliberately leaked out to particular
organizations or adversial entities, it is possible to extract meaningful
information about the user balances by employing minimum cost flow network
algorithms that have polynomial complexity. The experimental study reports the
Ethereum gas consumption and proof generation times for the proposed framework.
It also reports network solution times and goodness rates for a subset of
addresses under the balance range privacy attack with respect to number of
addresses, number of transactions and ratio of leaked transfer transaction
amounts.

<p class="mathjax">Biological research has revealed that the verbal semantic information in the
brain cortex, as an additional source, participates in nonverbal semantic
tasks, such as visual encoding. However, previous visual encoding models did
not incorporate verbal semantic information, contradicting this biological
finding. This paper proposes a multimodal visual information encoding network
model based on stimulus images and associated textual information in response
to this issue. Our visual information encoding network model takes stimulus
images as input and leverages textual information generated by a text-image
generation model as verbal semantic information. This approach injects new
information into the visual encoding model. Subsequently, a Transformer network
aligns image and text feature information, creating a multimodal feature space.
A convolutional network then maps from this multimodal feature space to voxel
space, constructing the multimodal visual information encoding network model.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal visual
information encoding network model outperforms previous models under the exact
training cost. In voxel prediction of the left hemisphere of subject 1's brain,
the performance improves by approximately 15.87%, while in the right
hemisphere, the performance improves by about 4.6%. The multimodal visual
encoding network model exhibits superior encoding performance. Additionally,
ablation experiments indicate that our proposed model better simulates the
brain's visual information processing.

<p class="mathjax">Summarizing knowledge from animals and human beings inspires robotic
innovations. In this work, we propose a framework for driving legged robots act
like real animals with lifelike agility and strategy in complex environments.
Inspired by large pre-trained models witnessed with impressive performance in
language and image understanding, we introduce the power of advanced deep
generative models to produce motor control signals stimulating legged robots to
act like real animals. Unlike conventional controllers and end-to-end RL
methods that are task-specific, we propose to pre-train generative models over
animal motion datasets to preserve expressive knowledge of animal behavior. The
pre-trained model holds sufficient primitive-level knowledge yet is
environment-agnostic. It is then reused for a successive stage of learning to
align with the environments by traversing a number of challenging obstacles
that are rarely considered in previous approaches, including creeping through
narrow spaces, jumping over hurdles, freerunning over scattered blocks, etc.
Finally, a task-specific controller is trained to solve complex downstream
tasks by reusing the knowledge from previous stages. Enriching the knowledge
regarding each stage does not affect the usage of other levels of knowledge.
This flexible framework offers the possibility of continual knowledge
accumulation at different levels. We successfully apply the trained multi-level
controllers to the MAX robot, a quadrupedal robot developed in-house, to mimic
animals, traverse complex obstacles, and play in a designed challenging
multi-agent Chase Tag Game, where lifelike agility and strategy emerge on the
robots. The present research pushes the frontier of robot control with new
insights on reusing multi-level pre-trained knowledge and solving highly
complex downstream tasks in the real world.

<p class="mathjax">The human brain exhibits remarkable abilities in integrating temporally
distant sensory inputs for decision-making. However, existing brain-inspired
spiking neural networks (SNNs) have struggled to match their biological
counterpart in modeling long-term temporal relationships. To address this
problem, this paper presents a novel Contextual Embedding Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (CE-LIF) spiking neuron model. Specifically, the CE-LIF
model incorporates a meticulously designed contextual embedding component into
the adaptive neuronal firing threshold, thereby enhancing the memory storage of
spiking neurons and facilitating effective sequential modeling. Additionally,
theoretical analysis is provided to elucidate how the CE-LIF model enables
long-term temporal credit assignment. Remarkably, when compared to
state-of-the-art recurrent SNNs, feedforward SNNs comprising the proposed
CE-LIF neurons demonstrate superior performance across extensive sequential

memory. However, the Bytes-per-Flops (B/F) ratio of the shared memory and
Tensor Cores is small since the performance of Tensor Cores is high. Thus, it
is important to reduce the shared memory footprint for efficient Tensor Cores
usage. In this paper, we analyze the simple matrix-matrix multiplication on
Tensor Cores by the roofline model and figure out that the bandwidth of shared
memory might be a limitation of the performance when using WMMA API. To
alleviate this issue, we provide a WMMA API extension library to boost the
throughput of the computation, which has two components. The first one allows
for manipulating the array of registers input to Tensor Cores flexibly. We
evaluate the performance improvement of this library. The outcome of our
evaluation shows that our library reduces the shared memory footprint and
speeds up the computation using Tensor Cores. The second one is an API for the
SGEMM emulation on Tensor Cores without additional shared memory usage. We have
demonstrated that the single-precision emulating batch SGEMM implementation on
Tensor Cores using this library achieves 54.2 TFlop/s on A100 GPU, which
outperforms the theoretical peak performance of FP32 SIMT Cores while achieving
the same level of accuracy as cuBLAS. The achieved throughput can not be
achieved without reducing the shared memory footprint done by our library with
the same amount of register usage.

<p class="mathjax">Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a peculiar and useful human skill. This
ability requires the coordination of many senses and hand motion to adhere to
many constraints. These constraints vary and can be influenced by the object
characteristics or the specific application. One of the key elements for a
robotic platform to implement reliable inhand manipulation skills is to be able
to integrate those constraints in their motion generations. These constraints
can be implicitly modelled, learned through experience or human demonstrations.
We propose a method based on motion primitives dictionaries to learn and
reproduce in-hand manipulation skills. In particular, we focused on fingertip
motions during the manipulation, and we defined an optimization process to
combine motion primitives to reach specific fingertip configurations. The
results of this work show that the proposed approach can generate manipulation
motion coherent with the human one and that manipulation constraints are
inherited even without an explicit formalization.

<p class="mathjax">The discourse around conspiracy theories is currently thriving amidst the
rampant misinformation prevalent in online environments. Research in this field
has been focused on detecting conspiracy theories on social media, often
relying on limited datasets. In this study, we present a novel methodology for
constructing a Twitter dataset that encompasses accounts engaged in
conspiracy-related activities throughout the year 2022. Our approach centers on
data collection that is independent of specific conspiracy theories and
information operations. Additionally, our dataset includes a control group
comprising randomly selected users who can be fairly compared to the
individuals involved in conspiracy activities. This comprehensive collection
effort yielded a total of 15K accounts and 37M tweets extracted from their
timelines. We conduct a comparative analysis of the two groups across three
dimensions: topics, profiles, and behavioral characteristics. The results
indicate that conspiracy and control users exhibit similarity in terms of their
profile metadata characteristics. However, they diverge significantly in terms
of behavior and activity, particularly regarding the discussed topics, the
terminology used, and their stance on trending subjects. Interestingly, there
is no significant disparity in the presence of bot users between the two
groups, suggesting that conspiracy and automation are orthogonal concepts.
Finally, we develop a classifier to identify conspiracy users using 93
features, some of which are commonly employed in literature for troll
identification. The results demonstrate a high accuracy level (with an average
F1 score of 0.98%), enabling us to uncover the most discriminative features
associated with conspiracy-related accounts.

<p class="mathjax">Risk-based authentication (RBA) aims to protect end-users against attacks
involving stolen or otherwise guessed passwords without requiring a second
authentication method all the time. Online services typically set limits on
what is still seen as normal and what is not, as well as the actions taken
afterward. Consequently, RBA monitors different features, such as geolocation
and device during login. If the features' values differ from the expected
values, then a second authentication method might be requested. However, only a
few online services publish information about how their systems work. This
hinders not only RBA research but also its development and adoption in
organizations. In order to understand how the RBA systems online services
operate, black box testing is applied. To verify the results, we re-evaluate
the three large providers: Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Based on our test
setup and the test cases, we notice differences in RBA based on account
creation at Google. Additionally, several test cases rarely trigger the RBA
system. Our results provide new insights into RBA systems and raise several
questions for future work.

<p class="mathjax">This article investigates synthetic model-predictive control (MPC) problems
to demonstrate that an increased precision of the internal prediction model
(PM) automatially entails an improvement of the controller as a whole. In
contrast to reinforcement learning (RL), MPC uses the PM to predict subsequent
states of the controlled system (CS), instead of directly recommending suitable
actions. To assess how the precision of the PM translates into the quality of
the model-predictive controller, we compare a DNN-based PM to the optimal
baseline PM for three well-known control problems of varying complexity. The
baseline PM achieves perfect accuracy by accessing the simulation of the CS
itself. Based on the obtained results, we argue that an improvement of the PM
will always improve the controller as a whole, without considering the impact
of other components such as action selection (which, in this article, relies on

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose Advanced Tree-algorithm with Interference
Cancellation (ATIC), a variant of binary tree-algorithm with successive
interference cancellation (SICTA) introduced by Yu and Giannakis. ATIC assumes
that Interference Cancellation (IC) can be performed both by the access point
(AP), as in SICTA, but also by the users. Specifically, after every collision
slot, the AP broadcasts the observed collision as feedback. Users who
participated in the collision then attempt to perform IC by subtracting their
transmissions from the collision signal. This way, the users can resolve
collisions of degree 2 and, using a simple distributed arbitration algorithm
based on user IDs, ensure that the next slot will contain just a single
transmission. We show that ATIC reaches the asymptotic throughput of 0.924 as
the number of initially collided users tends to infinity and reduces the number
of collisions and packet delay. We also compare ATIC with other tree algorithms
and indicate the extra feedback resources it requires.

<p class="mathjax">Data breaches resulting from targeted attacks against organizations, e.g., by
advanced persistent threat groups, often involve social engineering (SE) as the
initial attack vector before malicious software is used, e.g., for persistence,
lateral movement, and data exfiltration. While technical security controls,
such as the automated detection of phishing emails, can contribute to
mitigating SE risks, raising awareness for SE attacks through education and
motivation of personnel is an important building block to increasing an
organization's resilience. To facilitate hands-on SE awareness training as one
component of broader SE awareness campaigns, we created a SE tabletop game
called Tabletop As Social Engineering Prevention (TASEP) in two editions for
(a) small and medium enterprises and (b) large corporations, respectively. Its
game design is inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing games and
facilitates LEGO models of the in-game target organizations. Participants
switch roles by playing a group of SE penetration testers and conducting a
security audit guided by the game master. We evaluated the created game with
different student groups, achieving highly immersive and flexible training,
resulting in an entertaining way of learning about SE and raising awareness.

<p class="mathjax">As the size of models and datasets grows, it has become increasingly common
to train models in parallel. However, existing distributed stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) algorithms suffer from insufficient utilization of computational
resources and poor convergence in heterogeneous clusters. In this paper, we
propose a delayed synchronous SGD algorithm with adaptive batch size (ABS-SGD)
for heterogeneous GPU clusters. In ABS-SGD, workers perform global
synchronization to accumulate delayed gradients and use the accumulated delayed
gradients to update parameters. While workers are performing global
synchronization for delayed gradients, they perform the computation of the next
batch without specifying batch size in advance, which lasts until the next
global synchronization starts, realizing the full utilization of computational
resources. Since the gradient delay is only one iteration, the stale gradient
problem can be alleviated. We theoretically prove the convergence of ABS-SGD in
heterogeneous clusters. Extensive experiments in three types of heterogeneous
clusters demonstrate that ABS-SGD can make full use of computational resources
and accelerate model convergence: When training ResNet18 network with 4
workers, ABS-SGD increases the convergence speed by 1.30x on average compared
with the best baseline algorithm.

cyber-physical systems. They have progressively gained popularity over the past
years because of intense research activity and industrial advancements.
Cognitive Twins is a novel concept, recently coined to refer to the involvement
of Semantic Web technology in DTs. Recent studies address the relevance of
ontologies and knowledge graphs in the context of DTs, in terms of knowledge
representation, interoperability and automatic reasoning. However, there is no
comprehensive analysis of how semantic technologies, and specifically
ontologies, are utilized within DTs. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is
based on the analysis of 82 research articles, that either propose or benefit
from ontologies with respect to DT. The paper uses different analysis
perspectives, including a structural analysis based on a reference DT
architecture, and an application-specific analysis to specifically address the
different domains, such as Manufacturing and Infrastructure. The review also
identifies open issues and possible research directions on the usage of
ontologies and knowledge graphs in DTs.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a new and challenging Hidden Intention Discovery (HID)
task. Unlike existing intention recognition tasks, which are based on obvious
visual representations to identify common intentions for normal behavior, HID
focuses on discovering hidden intentions when humans try to hide their
intentions for abnormal behavior. HID presents a unique challenge in that
hidden intentions lack the obvious visual representations to distinguish them
from normal intentions. Fortunately, from a sociological and psychological
perspective, we find that the difference between hidden and normal intentions
can be reasoned from multiple micro-behaviors, such as gaze, attention, and
facial expressions. Therefore, we first discover the relationship between
micro-behavior and hidden intentions and use graph structure to reason about
hidden intentions. To facilitate research in the field of HID, we also
constructed a seminal dataset containing a hidden intention annotation of a
typical theft scenario for HID. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
network improves performance on the HID task by 9.9\% over the state-of-the-art
method SBP.

face images. Either one has to rely on expensive 3D scanners or depth sensors
which are prone to noise. An alternative option is the reconstruction of 3D
faces from uncalibrated 2D images in an unsupervised way without any ground
truth 3D data. However, such approaches are computationally expensive and the
learned model size is not suitable for mobile or other edge device
applications. Predicting dense 3D landmarks over the whole face can overcome
this issue. As there is no public dataset available containing dense landmarks,
we propose a pipeline to create a dense keypoint training dataset containing
520 key points across the whole face from an existing facial position map data.
We train a lightweight MobileNet-based regressor model with the generated data.
As we do not have access to any evaluation dataset with dense landmarks in it
we evaluate our model against the 68 keypoint detection task. Experimental
results show that our trained model outperforms many of the existing methods in
spite of its lower model size and minimal computational cost. Also, the
qualitative evaluation shows the efficiency of our trained models in extreme
head pose angles as well as other facial variations and occlusions.

<p class="mathjax">Phishing is a major cyber threat to organizations that can cause financial
and reputational damage, threatening their existence. The technical measures
against phishing should be complemented by awareness training for employees.
However, there is little validation of awareness measures. Consequently,
organizations have an additional burden when integrating awareness training, as
there is no consensus on which method brings the best success. This paper
examines how awareness concepts can be successfully implemented and validated.
For this purpose, various factors, such as requirements and possible
combinations of methods, are taken into account in our case study at a small-
and medium-sized enterprise (SME). To measure success, phishing exercises are
conducted. The study suggests that pleasant campaigns result in better
performance in the simulated phishing exercise. In addition, significant
improvements and differences in the target groups could be observed. The
implementation of awareness training with integrated key performance indicators
can be used as a basis for other organizations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper extends our previous study on an explicit saturated control for a
quadcopter, which ensures both constraint satisfaction and stability thanks to
the linear representation of the system in the flat output space. The novelty
here resides in the adaptivity of the controller's gain to enhance the system's
performance without exciting its parasitic dynamics and avoid lavishing the
input actuation with excessively high gain parameters. Moreover, we provide a
thorough robustness analysis of the proposed controller when additive
disturbances are affecting the system behavior. Finally, simulation and
experimental tests validate the proposed controller.

<p class="mathjax">We consider an agent acting to fulfil tasks in a nondeterministic
environment. When a strategy that fulfills the task regardless of how the
environment acts does not exist, the agent should at least avoid adopting
strategies that prevent from fulfilling its task. Best-effort synthesis
captures this intuition. In this paper, we devise and compare various symbolic
approaches for best-effort synthesis in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces
(LTLf). These approaches are based on the same basic components, however they
change in how these components are combined, and this has a significant impact
on the performance of the approaches as confirmed by our empirical evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">Context: Software model optimization is a process that automatically
generates design alternatives, typically to enhance quantifiable non-functional
properties of software systems, such as performance and reliability.
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have shown to be effective in this
context for assisting the designer in identifying trade-offs between the
desired non-functional properties. Objective: In this work, we investigate the
effects of imposing a time budget to limit the search for design alternatives,
which inevitably affects the quality of the resulting alternatives. Method: The
effects of time budgets are analyzed by investigating both the quality of the
generated design alternatives and their structural features when varying the
budget and the genetic algorithm (NSGA-II, PESA2, SPEA2). This is achieved by
employing multi-objective quality indicators and a tree-based representation of
the search space. Results: The study reveals that the time budget significantly
affects the quality of Pareto fronts, especially for performance and
reliability. NSGA-II is the fastest algorithm, while PESA2 generates the
highest-quality solutions. The imposition of a time budget results in
structurally distinct models compared to those obtained without a budget,
indicating that the search process is influenced by both the budget and
algorithm selection. Conclusions: In software model optimization, imposing a
time budget can be effective in saving optimization time, but designers should
carefully consider the trade-off between time and solution quality in the
Pareto front, along with the structural characteristics of the generated
models. By making informed choices about the specific genetic algorithm,
designers can achieve different trade-offs.

<p class="mathjax">We study best-effort strategies (aka plans) in fully observable
nondeterministic domains (FOND) for goals expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on
Finite Traces (LTLf). The notion of best-effort strategy has been introduced to
also deal with the scenario when no agent strategy exists that fulfills the
goal against every possible nondeterministic environment reaction. Such
strategies fulfill the goal if possible, and do their best to do so otherwise.
We present a game-theoretic technique for synthesizing best-effort strategies
that exploit the specificity of nondeterministic planning domains. We formally
show its correctness and demonstrate its effectiveness experimentally,
exhibiting a much greater scalability with respect to a direct best-effort
synthesis approach based on re-expressing the planning domain as generic
environment specifications.

<p class="mathjax">Touchscreens equipped with friction modulation can provide rich tactile
feedback to their users. To date, there are no standard metrics to properly
quantify the benefit brought by haptic feedback.The definition of such metrics
is not straightforward since friction modulation technologies can be achieved
by either ultrasonic waves or with electroadhesion. In addition, the output
depends strongly on the user, both because of the mechanical behavior of the
fingertip and personal tactile somatosensory capabilities. This paper proposes
a method to evaluate and compare the performance of haptic tablets on an
objective scale. The method first defines multiple metrics using physical
measurements of friction and latency. The comparison is completed with metrics
derived from information theory and based on pointing tasks performed by users.
We evaluated the comparison method with two haptic devices, one based on
ultrasonic friction modulation and the other based on electroadhesion. This
work paves the way toward the definitions of standard specifications for haptic
tablets, to establish benchmarks and guidelines for improving surface haptic
devices.

<p class="mathjax">This report describes the state of the art in verifiable computation. The
problem being solved is the following:
<br />The Verifiable Computation Problem (Verifiable Computing Problem) Suppose we
have two computing agents. The first agent is the verifier, and the second
agent is the prover. The verifier wants the prover to perform a computation.
The verifier sends a description of the computation to the prover. Once the
prover has completed the task, the prover returns the output to the verifier.
The output will contain proof. The verifier can use this proof to check if the
prover computed the output correctly. The check is not required to verify the
algorithm used in the computation. Instead, it is a check that the prover
computed the output using the computation specified by the verifier. The effort
required for the check should be much less than that required to perform the
computation.
<br />This state-of-the-art report surveys 128 papers from the literature
comprising more than 4,000 pages. Other papers and books were surveyed but were
omitted. The papers surveyed were overwhelmingly mathematical. We have
summarised the major concepts that form the foundations for verifiable
computation. The report contains two main sections. The first, larger section
covers the theoretical foundations for probabilistically checkable and
zero-knowledge proofs. The second section contains a description of the current
practice in verifiable computation. Two further reports will cover (i) military
applications of verifiable computation and (ii) a collection of technical
demonstrators. The first of these is intended to be read by those who want to
know what applications are enabled by the current state of the art in
verifiable computation. The second is for those who want to see practical tools
and conduct experiments themselves.

<p class="mathjax">In the contemporary landscape of social media, an alarming number of users
express negative emotions, some of which manifest as strong suicidal
intentions. This situation underscores a profound need for trained
psychological counselors who can enact effective mental interventions. However,
the development of these professionals is often an imperative but
time-consuming task. Consequently, the mobilization of non-professionals or
volunteers in this capacity emerges as a pressing concern. Leveraging the
capabilities of artificial intelligence, and in particular, the recent advances
in large language models, offers a viable solution to this challenge. This
paper introduces a novel model constructed on the foundation of large language
models to fully assist non-professionals in providing psychological
interventions on online user discourses. This framework makes it plausible to
harness the power of non-professional counselors in a meaningful way. A
comprehensive study was conducted involving ten professional psychological
counselors of varying expertise, evaluating the system across five critical
dimensions. The findings affirm that our system is capable of analyzing
patients' issues with relative accuracy and proffering professional-level
strategies recommendations, thereby enhancing support for non-professionals.
This research serves as a compelling validation of the application of large
language models in the field of psychology and lays the groundwork for a new
paradigm of community-based mental health support.

<p class="mathjax">Due to quasicrystals having long-range orientational order but without
translational symmetry, traditional numerical methods usually suffer when
applied as is. In the past decade, the projection method has emerged as a

dimensional but periodic ones, the projection method facilitates the
application of the fast Fourier transform. However, the computational
complexity inevitably becomes high which significantly impedes e.g. the
generation of the phase diagram since a high-fidelity simulation of a problem
whose dimension is doubled must be performed for numerous times.
<br />To address the computational challenge of quasiperiodic problems based on the
projection method, this paper proposes a multi-component multi-state reduced
basis method (MCMS-RBM). Featuring multiple components with each providing
reduction functionality for one branch of the problem induced by one part of
the parameter domain, the MCMS-RBM does not resort to the parameter domain
configurations (e.g. phase diagrams) a priori. It enriches each component in a
greedy fashion via a phase-transition guided exploration of the multiple states
inherent to the problem. Adopting the empirical interpolation method, the
resulting online-efficient method vastly accelerates the generation of a
delicate phase diagram to a matter of minutes for a parametrized two-turn-four
dimensional Lifshitz-Petrich model with two length scales. Moreover, it
furnishes surrogate and equally accurate field variables anywhere in the
parameter domain.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate human mobility prediction underpins many important applications
across a variety of domains, including epidemic modelling, transport planning,
and emergency responses. Due to the sparsity of mobility data and the
stochastic nature of people's daily activities, achieving precise predictions
of people's locations remains a challenge. While recently developed large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance across numerous
language-related tasks, their applicability to human mobility studies remains
unexplored. Addressing this gap, this article delves into the potential of LLMs
for human mobility prediction tasks. We introduce a novel method, LLM-Mob,
which leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs
for analysing human mobility data. We present concepts of historical stays and
context stays to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in human
movement and enable time-aware prediction by using time information of the
prediction target. Additionally, we design context-inclusive prompts that
enable LLMs to generate more accurate predictions. Comprehensive evaluations of
our method reveal that LLM-Mob excels in providing accurate and interpretable
predictions, highlighting the untapped potential of LLMs in advancing human
mobility prediction techniques. We posit that our research marks a significant
paradigm shift in human mobility modelling, transitioning from building complex
domain-specific models to harnessing general-purpose LLMs that yield accurate
predictions through language instructions. The code for this work is available
at https://github.com/xlwang233/LLM-Mob.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the allocation of indivisible objects among agents with different
valuations, which can be positive or negative. An egalitarian allocation is an
allocation that maximizes the smallest value given to an agent; finding such an
allocation is NP-hard. We present a simple polynomial-time algorithm that finds
an allocation that is Pareto-efficient and almost-egalitarian: each agent's
value is at least his value in an egalitarian allocation, minus the absolute
value of a single object. The main tool is an algorithm for rounding a
fractional allocation to a discrete allocation, by which each agent loses at
most one good or gains at most one chore. Our algorithm generalizes and
simplifies three previous algorithms. We discuss several aspects and
observations about the algorithm and the problem at hand that open doors for
efficient and robust implementations.

<p class="mathjax">Fighting misinformation is a challenging, yet crucial, task. Despite the
growing number of experts being involved in manual fact-checking, this activity
is time-consuming and cannot keep up with the ever-increasing amount of Fake
News produced daily. Hence, automating this process is necessary to help curb
misinformation. Thus far, researchers have mainly focused on claim veracity
classification. In this paper, instead, we address the generation of
justifications (textual explanation of why a claim is classified as either true
or false) and benchmark it with novel datasets and advanced baselines. In
particular, we focus on summarization approaches over unstructured knowledge
(i.e. news articles) and we experiment with several extractive and abstractive
strategies. We employed two datasets with different styles and structures, in
order to assess the generalizability of our findings. Results show that in
justification production summarization benefits from the claim information,
and, in particular, that a claim-driven extractive step improves abstractive
summarization performances. Finally, we show that although cross-dataset
experiments suffer from performance degradation, a unique model trained on a
combination of the two datasets is able to retain style information in an
efficient manner.

<p class="mathjax">Why do bilingual speakers code-switch (mix their two languages)? Among the
several theories that attempt to explain this natural and ubiquitous
phenomenon, the Triggering Hypothesis relates code-switching to the presence of
lexical triggers, specifically cognates and proper names, adjacent to the
switch point. We provide a fuller, more nuanced and refined exploration of the
triggering hypothesis, based on five large datasets in three language pairs,
reflecting both spoken and written bilingual interactions. Our results show
that words that are assumed to reside in a mental lexicon shared by both
languages indeed trigger code-switching; that the tendency to switch depends on
the distance of the trigger from the switch point; and on whether the trigger
precedes or succeeds the switch; but not on the etymology of the trigger words.
We thus provide strong, robust, evidence-based confirmation to several
hypotheses on the relationships between lexical triggers and code-switching.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the behaviour of a system's API can be hard. Giving users
access to relevant examples of how an API behaves has been shown to make this
easier for them. In addition, such examples can be used to verify expected
behaviour or identify unwanted behaviours.
<br />Methods for automatically generating examples have existed for a long time.
However, state-of-the-art methods rely on either white-box information, such as
source code, or on formal specifications of the system behaviour. But what if
you do not have access to either? e.g., when interacting with a third-party
API.
<br />In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate relevant
examples of behaviours of an API, without requiring either source code or a
formal specification of behaviour.
<br />Evaluation on an industry-grade REST API shows that our method can produce
small and relevant examples that can help engineers to understand the system
under exploration.

First,different from previous 2D-PEH, the proposed 2D-DPEH is established by
selecting two distinct predictors with low correlation to calculate double
prediction errors for each pixel. In addition, we adopt DP to optimize the
selection of expansion bins, speeding up the running time and improving the
quality of the embedded image. Finally,we combined the proposed method with
C-PEE and original MHM, then designed comparative experiments with state

<p class="mathjax">Previously, in the field of medical image registration, there are primarily
two paradigms, the traditional optimization-based methods, and the
deep-learning-based methods. Each of these paradigms has its advantages, and in
this work, we aim to take the best of both worlds. Instead of developing a new
deep learning model, we designed a robust training architecture that is simple
and generalizable. We present Optron, a general training architecture
incorporating the idea of training-in-the-loop. By iteratively optimizing the
prediction result of a deep learning model through a plug-and-play optimizer
module in the training loop, Optron introduces pseudo ground truth to an
unsupervised training process. And by bringing the training process closer to
that of supervised training, Optron can consistently improve the models'
performance and convergence speed. We evaluated our method on various
combinations of models and datasets, and we have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the IXI dataset, improving the previous state-of-the-art method
TransMorph by a significant margin of +1.6% DSC. Moreover, Optron also
consistently achieved positive results with other models and datasets. It
increases the validation DSC for VoxelMorph and ViT-V-Net by +2.3% and +2.2%
respectively on IXI, demonstrating our method's generalizability. Our
implementation is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Introduction: Characteristics of hemodynamics strongly affect the patency of
arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in hemodialysis patients. Because of pressure
balance changes among arteries after AVF construction, regurgitating flow
occurs in some patients.
<br />Methods: Based on phase-contrast MRI measurements, flow types around the
anastomotic site are classified to the three different types of splitting,
merging, and one-way, where merging type incorporates regurgitating flow. We
have performed computational simulations to analyze characteristic differences
among these types.
<br />Results: In the merging type, a characteristic spiral flow is observed in AVF
causing strong wall shear stress and large pressure drop, whereas the splitting
type shows a smooth flow and gives a smaller pressure drop. The one-way case is
intermediate between splitting and merging types.
<br />Conclusion: Regurgitation brings about high wall shear stress near the
anastomotic site because of instabilities induced by merging phenomena, for
which type careful follow-up examinations are regarded as necessary.

<p class="mathjax">Communities, ranging from homes to cities, are a ubiquitous part of our
lives. However, there is a lack of adequate support for applications built
around these communities. As a result, current applications each need to
implement their own notion of communities, making it difficult for both the app
developers and the app users (\ie the community admins and members) to create
and use these community apps. In this paper, we argue that communities should
be supported at the infrastructure-level rather than at the app-level. We refer
to this approach as the Platform-Managed Community (PMC). We propose Comverse,
a platform designed to this end. Comverse is predicated on the principle of
federation, allowing autonomous nodes representing community members to
voluntarily associate and share data while maintaining control over their data
and participation. Through Comverse, we explore the vision of community
computing by showcasing its applicability with real-world community apps.

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate time series classification is an important computational task
arising in applications where data is recorded over time and over multiple
channels. For example, a smartwatch can record the acceleration and orientation
of a person's motion, and these signals are recorded as multivariate time
series. We can classify this data to understand and predict human movement and
various properties such as fitness levels. In many applications classification
alone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what the
model learns (e.g., why was a prediction given, based on what information in
the data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluating
explanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC).
We focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the most
relevant channels and time series points for the classification decision. We
analyse two popular and accurate multivariate time series classifiers, ROCKET
and dResNet, as well as two popular explanation methods, SHAP and dCAM. We
study these methods on 3 synthetic datasets and 2 real-world datasets and
provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the explanations provided.
We find that flattening the multivariate datasets by concatenating the channels
works as well as using multivariate classifiers directly and adaptations of
SHAP for MTSC work quite well. Additionally, we also find that the popular
synthetic datasets we used are not suitable for time series analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Research consumption has been traditionally limited to the reading of
academic papers-a static, dense, and formally written format. Alternatively,
pre-recorded conference presentation videos, which are more dynamic, concise,
and colloquial, have recently become more widely available but potentially
under-utilized. In this work, we explore the design space and benefits for
combining academic papers and talk videos to leverage their complementary
nature to provide a rich and fluid research consumption experience. Based on
formative and co-design studies, we present Papeos, a novel reading and
authoring interface that allow authors to augment their papers by segmenting
and localizing talk videos alongside relevant paper passages with automatically
generated suggestions. With Papeos, readers can visually skim a paper through
clip thumbnails, and fluidly switch between consuming dense text in the paper
or visual summaries in the video. In a comparative lab study (n=16), Papeos
reduced mental load, scaffolded navigation, and facilitated more comprehensive
reading of papers.

<p class="mathjax">There has been a growing interest in developing multimodal machine
translation (MMT) systems that enhance neural machine translation (NMT) with
visual knowledge. This problem setup involves using images as auxiliary
information during training, and more recently, eliminating their use during
inference. Towards this end, previous works face a challenge in training
powerful MMT models from scratch due to the scarcity of annotated multilingual
vision-language data, especially for low-resource languages. Simultaneously,
there has been an influx of multilingual pre-trained models for NMT and
multimodal pre-trained models for vision-language tasks, primarily in English,
which have shown exceptional generalisation ability. However, these are not
directly applicable to MMT since they do not provide aligned multimodal
multilingual features for generative tasks. To alleviate this issue, instead of
designing complex modules for MMT, we propose CLIPTrans, which simply adapts
the independently pre-trained multimodal M-CLIP and the multilingual mBART. In
order to align their embedding spaces, mBART is conditioned on the M-CLIP
features by a prefix sequence generated through a lightweight mapping network.
We train this in a two-stage pipeline which warms up the model with image
captioning before the actual translation task. Through experiments, we
demonstrate the merits of this framework and consequently push forward the
state-of-the-art across standard benchmarks by an average of +2.67 BLEU. The
code can be found at www.github.com/devaansh100/CLIPTrans.

<p class="mathjax">An emerging definition of fairness in machine learning requires that models
are oblivious to demographic user information, e.g., a user's gender or age
should not influence the model. Personalized recommender systems are
particularly prone to violating this definition through their explicit user
focus and user modelling. Explicit user modelling is also an aspect that makes
many recommender systems incapable of providing hitherto unseen users with
recommendations. We propose novel approaches for mitigating discrimination in
Variational Autoencoder-based recommender systems by limiting the encoding of
demographic information. The approaches are capable of, and evaluated on,
providing users that are not represented in the training data with fair
recommendations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper evaluates the extent to which current Large Language Models (LLMs)
can capture task-oriented multi-party conversations (MPCs). We have recorded
and transcribed 29 MPCs between patients, their companions, and a social robot
in a hospital. We then annotated this corpus for multi-party goal-tracking and
intent-slot recognition. People share goals, answer each other's goals, and
provide other people's goals in MPCs - none of which occur in dyadic
interactions. To understand user goals in MPCs, we compared three methods in
zero-shot and few-shot settings: we fine-tuned T5, created pre-training tasks
to train DialogLM using LED, and employed prompt engineering techniques with
GPT-3.5-turbo, to determine which approach can complete this novel task with
limited data. GPT-3.5-turbo significantly outperformed the others in a few-shot
setting. The `reasoning' style prompt, when given 7% of the corpus as example
annotated conversations, was the best performing method. It correctly annotated
62.32% of the goal tracking MPCs, and 69.57% of the intent-slot recognition
MPCs. A `story' style prompt increased model hallucination, which could be
detrimental if deployed in safety-critical settings. We conclude that
multi-party conversations still challenge state-of-the-art LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">The growth of open-source software has increased the risk of hidden
vulnerabilities that can affect downstream software applications. This concern
is further exacerbated by software vendors' practice of silently releasing
security patches without explicit warnings or common vulnerability and exposure
(CVE) notifications. This lack of transparency leaves users unaware of
potential security threats, giving attackers an opportunity to take advantage
of these vulnerabilities. In the complex landscape of software patches,
grasping the nuanced semantics of a patch is vital for ensuring secure software
maintenance. To address this challenge, we introduce a multilevel Semantic
Embedder for security patch detection, termed MultiSEM. This model harnesses
word-centric vectors at a fine-grained level, emphasizing the significance of
individual words, while the coarse-grained layer adopts entire code lines for
vector representation, capturing the essence and interrelation of added or
removed lines. We further enrich this representation by assimilating patch
descriptions to obtain a holistic semantic portrait. This combination of
multi-layered embeddings offers a robust representation, balancing word
complexity, understanding code-line insights, and patch descriptions.
Evaluating MultiSEM for detecting patch security, our results demonstrate its
superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art models with promising margins: a
22.46\% improvement on PatchDB and a 9.21\% on SPI-DB in terms of the F1
metric.

<p class="mathjax">Within the realm of advanced code retrieval, existing methods have primarily
relied on intricate matching and attention-based mechanisms. However, these
methods often lead to computational and memory inefficiencies, posing a
significant challenge to their real-world applicability. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, the Hyperbolic Code QA Matching
(HyCoQA). This approach leverages the unique properties of Hyperbolic space to
express connections between code fragments and their corresponding queries,
thereby obviating the necessity for intricate interaction layers. The process
commences with a reimagining of the code retrieval challenge, framed within a
question-answering (QA) matching framework, constructing a dataset with triple
matches characterized as \texttt{&lt;}negative code, description, positive
code\texttt{&gt;}. These matches are subsequently processed via a static BERT
embedding layer, yielding initial embeddings. Thereafter, a hyperbolic embedder
transforms these representations into hyperbolic space, calculating distances
between the codes and descriptions. The process concludes by implementing a
scoring layer on these distances and leveraging hinge loss for model training.
Especially, the design of HyCoQA inherently facilitates self-organization,
allowing for the automatic detection of embedded hierarchical patterns during
the learning phase. Experimentally, HyCoQA showcases remarkable effectiveness
in our evaluations: an average performance improvement of 3.5\% to 4\% compared
to state-of-the-art code retrieval techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Flip through any book or listen to any song lyrics, and you will come across
pronouns that, in certain cases, can hinder meaning comprehension, especially
for machines. As the role of having cognitive machines becomes pervasive in our
lives, numerous systems have been developed to resolve pronouns under various
challenges. Commensurate with this, it is believed that having systems able to
disambiguate pronouns in sentences will help towards the endowment of machines
with commonsense and reasoning abilities like those found in humans. However,
one problem these systems face with modern English is the lack of gender
pronouns, where people try to alternate by using masculine, feminine, or plural
to avoid the whole issue. Since humanity aims to the building of systems in the
full-bodied sense we usually reserve for people, what happens when pronouns in
written text, like plural or epicene ones, refer to unspecified entities whose
gender is not necessarily known? Wouldn't that put extra barriers to existing
coreference resolution systems? Towards answering those questions, through the
implementation of a neural-symbolic system that utilizes the best of both
worlds, we are employing PronounFlow, a system that reads any English sentence
with pronouns and entities, identifies which of them are not tied to each
other, and makes suggestions on which to use to avoid biases. Undertaken
experiments show that PronounFlow not only alternates pronouns in sentences
based on the collective human knowledge around us but also considerably helps
coreference resolution systems with the pronoun disambiguation process.

<p class="mathjax">Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to recognize both the old and new
classes along the increment tasks. Deep neural networks in CIL suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and some approaches rely on saving exemplars from
previous tasks, known as the exemplar-based setting, to alleviate this problem.
On the contrary, this paper focuses on the Exemplar-Free setting with no old
class sample preserved. Balancing the plasticity and stability in deep feature
learning with only supervision from new classes is more challenging. Most
existing Exemplar-Free CIL methods report the overall performance only and lack
further analysis. In this work, different methods are examined with
complementary metrics in greater detail. Moreover, we propose a simple CIL
method, Rotation Augmented Distillation (RAD), which achieves one of the
top-tier performances under the Exemplar-Free setting. Detailed analysis shows
our RAD benefits from the superior balance between plasticity and stability.
Finally, more challenging exemplar-free settings with fewer initial classes are
undertaken for further demonstrations and comparisons among the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Cyclostationarity involves periodic statistical variations in signals and
processes, commonly used in signal analysis and network security. In the
context of attacks, cyclostationarity helps detect malicious behaviors within
network traffic, such as traffic patterns in Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks or hidden communication channels in malware. This approach
enhances security by identifying abnormal patterns and informing Network
Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) to recognize potential attacks, enhancing
protection against both known and novel threats. This research focuses on
identifying cyclostationary malware behavior and its detection. The main goal
is to pinpoint essential cyclostationary features used in NIDSs. These features
are extracted using algorithms such as Boruta and Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), and then categorized to find the most significant cyclostationary
patterns. The aim of this article is to reveal periodically changing malware
behaviors through cyclostationarity. The study highlights the importance of
spotting cyclostationary malware in NIDSs by using established datasets like
KDD99, NSL-KDD, and the UGRansome dataset. The UGRansome dataset is designed
for anomaly detection research and includes both normal and abnormal network
threat categories of zero-day attacks. A comparison is made using the Random
Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, while also evaluating
the effectiveness of Boruta and PCA. The findings show that PCA is more
promising than using Boruta alone for extracting cyclostationary network
feature patterns. Additionally, the analysis identifies the internet protocol
as the most noticeable cyclostationary feature pattern used by malware.
Notably, the UGRansome dataset outperforms the KDD99 and NSL-KDD, achieving 99%
accuracy in signature malware detection using the RF algorithm and 98% with the
SVM.

<p class="mathjax">One of the developers' biggest challenges in low-code platforms is retrieving
data from a database using SQL queries. Here, we propose a pipeline allowing
developers to write natural language (NL) to retrieve data. In this study, we
collect, label, and validate data covering the SQL queries most often performed
by OutSystems users. We use that data to train a NL model that generates SQL.
Alongside this, we describe the entire pipeline, which comprises a feedback
loop that allows us to quickly collect production data and use it to retrain
our SQL generation model. Using crowd-sourcing, we collect 26k NL and SQL pairs
and obtain an additional 1k pairs from production data. Finally, we develop a
UI that allows developers to input a NL query in a prompt and receive a
user-friendly representation of the resulting SQL query. We use A/B testing to
compare four different models in production and observe a 240% improvement in
terms of adoption of the feature, 220% in terms of engagement rate, and a 90%
decrease in failure rate when compared against the first model that we put into
production, showcasing the effectiveness of our pipeline in continuously
improving our feature.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the inter-rater reliability of risk assessment
instruments (RAIs). The main question is whether different, socially salient
groups are affected differently by a lack of inter-rater reliability of RAIs,
that is, whether mistakes with respect to different groups affects them
differently. The question is investigated with a simulation study of the COMPAS
dataset. A controlled degree of noise is injected into the input data of a
predictive model; the noise can be interpreted as a synthetic rater that makes
mistakes. The main finding is that there are systematic differences in output
reliability between groups in the COMPAS dataset. The sign of the difference
depends on the kind of inter-rater statistic that is used (Cohen's Kappa,
Byrt's PABAK, ICC), and in particular whether or not a correction of
predictions prevalences of the groups is used.

<p class="mathjax">Since Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain rich semantic information, recently
there has been an influx of KG-enhanced recommendation methods. Most of
existing methods are entirely designed based on euclidean space without
considering curvature. However, recent studies have revealed that a tremendous
graph-structured data exhibits highly non-euclidean properties. Motivated by
these observations, in this work, we propose a knowledge-based multiple
adaptive spaces fusion method for recommendation, namely MCKG. Unlike existing
methods that solely adopt a specific manifold, we introduce the unified space
that is compatible with hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical spaces.
Furthermore, we fuse the multiple unified spaces in an attention manner to
obtain the high-quality embeddings for better knowledge propagation. In
addition, we propose a geometry-aware optimization strategy which enables the
pull and push processes benefited from both hyperbolic and spherical spaces.
Specifically, in hyperbolic space, we set smaller margins in the area near to
the origin, which is conducive to distinguishing between highly similar
positive items and negative ones. At the same time, we set larger margins in
the area far from the origin to ensure the model has sufficient error
tolerance. The similar manner also applies to spherical spaces. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the MCKG has a
significant improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further
ablation experiments verify the importance of multi-space fusion and
geometry-aware optimization strategy, justifying the rationality and
effectiveness of MCKG.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have been shown to be vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, wherein carefully crafted perturbations of the input can
mislead the target model. In this paper, we introduce ACT, a novel adversarial
attack framework against NMT systems guided by a classifier. In our attack, the
adversary aims to craft meaning-preserving adversarial examples whose
translations by the NMT model belong to a different class than the original
translations in the target language. Unlike previous attacks, our new approach
has a more substantial effect on the translation by altering the overall
meaning, which leads to a different class determined by a classifier. To
evaluate the robustness of NMT models to this attack, we propose enhancements
to existing black-box word-replacement-based attacks by incorporating output
translations of the target NMT model and the output logits of a classifier
within the attack process. Extensive experiments in various settings, including
a comparison with existing untargeted attacks, demonstrate that the proposed
attack is considerably more successful in altering the class of the output
translation and has more effect on the translation. This new paradigm can show
the vulnerabilities of NMT systems by focusing on the class of translation
rather than the mere translation quality as studied traditionally.

<p class="mathjax">The Gaussian Mechanism (GM), which consists in adding Gaussian noise to a
vector-valued query before releasing it, is a standard privacy protection
mechanism. In particular, given that the query respects some L2 sensitivity
property (the L2 distance between outputs on any two neighboring inputs is
bounded), GM guarantees R\'enyi Differential Privacy (RDP). Unfortunately,
precisely bounding the L2 sensitivity can be hard, thus leading to loose
privacy bounds. In this work, we consider a Relative L2 sensitivity assumption,
in which the bound on the distance between two query outputs may also depend on
their norm. Leveraging this assumption, we introduce the Relative Gaussian
Mechanism (RGM), in which the variance of the noise depends on the norm of the
output. We prove tight bounds on the RDP parameters under relative L2
sensitivity, and characterize the privacy loss incurred by using
output-dependent noise. In particular, we show that RGM naturally adapts to a
latent variable that would control the norm of the output. Finally, we
instantiate our framework to show tight guarantees for Private Gradient
Descent, a problem that naturally fits our relative L2 sensitivity assumption.

<p class="mathjax">The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a popular method for
evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities in vulnerability management. In the
evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being
the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable
scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS
might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts,
their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS
evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We
systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS
users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for
widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the ''2022
CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses'' list. In a follow-up survey
with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main
study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals
that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they
still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we
discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide
recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring.

disturbance rejection for a group of agents under the leader-follower
structure. The disturbances are in the form of a trigonometric polynomial with
arbitrary unknown amplitudes, unknown initial phases, and known or unknown
frequencies. For the case of the known frequencies, we employ the canonical
internal model to solve the problem, and, for the case of the unknown
frequencies, we combine the canonical internal model and {some} distributed
adaptive control technique to deal with the problem. It is noted that the
existing results can only handle constant input disturbances by continuous
control laws or disturbances with known {bounds} by discontinuous control laws.
The first case is a special case of our result. The second case cannot cover
our results because the bound of our disturbance is unknown. Moreover, our

<p class="mathjax">Until recently, the Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) community operated
under the common belief that offline methods are generally superior to a frame
by frame online processing. However, the recent success of online methods
questions this belief, in particular, for challenging and long video sequences.
We understand this work as a rebuttal of those recent observations and an
appeal to the community to focus on dedicated near-online VIS approaches. To
support our argument, we present a detailed analysis on different processing
paradigms and the new end-to-end trainable NOVIS (Near-Online Video Instance
Segmentation) method. Our transformer-based model directly predicts
spatio-temporal mask volumes for clips of frames and performs instance tracking
between clips via overlap embeddings. NOVIS represents the first near-online
VIS approach which avoids any handcrafted tracking heuristics. We outperform
all existing VIS methods by large margins and provide new state-of-the-art
results on both YouTube-VIS (2019/2021) and the OVIS benchmarks.

applications where multiple parties need to collaborate with each other
privately to arrive at certain results. Blockchain, as a database shared across
the network, provides an underlying platform on which such aggregations can be
carried out with a decentralized manner. Therefore, in this paper, we have
proposed a scalable privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol for summation
on the Ethereum blockchain by integrating several cryptographic primitives
including commitment scheme, asymmetric encryption and zero-knowledge proof
along with the hypercube network topology. The protocol consists of four stages
as contract deployment, user registration, private submission and proof
verification. The analysis of the protocol is made with respect to two main
perspectives as security and scalability including computational,
communicational and storage overheads. In the paper, the zero-knowledge proof,
smart contract and web user interface models for the protocol are provided. We
have performed an experimental study in order to identify the required gas
costs per individual and per system. The general formulation is provided to
characterize the changes in gas costs for the increasing number of users. The

<p class="mathjax">Robotic manipulators are often designed with more actuated degrees-of-freedom
than required to fully control an end effector's position and orientation.
These "redundant" manipulators can allow infinite joint configurations that
satisfy a particular task-space position and orientation, providing more
possibilities for the manipulator to traverse a smooth collision-free
trajectory. However, finding such a trajectory is non-trivial because the
inverse kinematics for redundant manipulators cannot typically be solved
analytically. Many strategies have been developed to tackle this problem,
including Jacobian pseudo-inverse method, rapidly-expanding-random tree (RRT)
motion planning, and quadratic programming (QP) based methods. Here, we present
a flexible inverse kinematics-based QP strategy (iKinQP). Because it is
independent of robot dynamics, the algorithm is relatively light-weight, and
able to run in real-time in step with torque control. Collisions are defined as
kinematic trees of elementary geometries, making the algorithm agnostic to the
method used to determine what collisions are in the environment. Collisions are
treated as hard constraints which guarantees the generation of collision-free
trajectories. Trajectory smoothness is accomplished through the QP
optimization. Our algorithm was evaluated for computational efficiency,
smoothness, and its ability to provide trackable trajectories. It was shown
that iKinQP is capable of providing smooth, collision-free trajectories at
real-time rates.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile task automation is an attractive technique that aims to enable
voice-based hands-free user interaction with smartphones. However, existing
approaches suffer from poor scalability due to the limited language
understanding ability and the non-trivial manual efforts required from
developers or end-users. The recent advance of large language models (LLMs) in
language understanding and reasoning inspires us to rethink the problem from a
model-centric perspective, where task preparation, comprehension, and execution
are handled by a unified language model. In this work, we introduce AutoDroid,
a mobile task automation system that can handle arbitrary tasks on any Android
application without manual efforts. The key insight is to combine the
commonsense knowledge of LLMs and domain-specific knowledge of apps through
automated dynamic analysis. The main components include a functionality-aware
UI representation method that bridges the UI with the LLM, exploration-based
memory injection techniques that augment the app-specific domain knowledge of
LLM, and a multi-granularity query optimization module that reduces the cost of
model inference. We integrate AutoDroid with off-the-shelf LLMs including
online GPT-4/GPT-3.5 and on-device Vicuna, and evaluate its performance on a
new benchmark for memory-augmented Android task automation with 158 common
tasks. The results demonstrated that AutoDroid is able to precisely generate
actions with an accuracy of 90.9%, and complete tasks with a success rate of
71.3%, outperforming the GPT-4-powered baselines by 36.4% and 39.7%. The demo,
benchmark suites, and source code of AutoDroid will be released at
https://autodroid-sys.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot classification ability, namely image classification using novel text
labels. Existing works have attempted to enhance CLIP by fine-tuning on
downstream tasks, but these have inadvertently led to performance degradation
on unseen classes, thus harming zero-shot generalization. This paper aims to
address this challenge by leveraging readily available image-text pairs from an
external dataset for cross-modal guidance during inference. To this end, we
propose X-MoRe, a novel inference method comprising two key steps: (1)
cross-modal retrieval and (2) modal-confidence-based ensemble. Given a query
image, we harness the power of CLIP's cross-modal representations to retrieve
relevant textual information from an external image-text pair dataset. Then, we
assign higher weights to the more reliable modality between the original query
image and retrieved text, contributing to the final prediction. X-MoRe
demonstrates robust performance across a diverse set of tasks without the need
for additional training, showcasing the effectiveness of utilizing cross-modal
features to maximize CLIP's zero-shot ability.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in multiple software
engineering tasks including code generation, code summarisation, test
generation and code repair. Fault localisation is essential for facilitating
automatic program debugging and repair, and is demonstrated as a highlight at
ChatGPT-4's launch event. Nevertheless, there has been little work
understanding LLMs' capabilities for fault localisation in large-scale
open-source programs. To fill this gap, this paper presents an in-depth
investigation into the capability of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, the two
state-of-the-art LLMs, on fault localisation. Using the widely-adopted
Defects4J dataset, we compare the two LLMs with the existing fault localisation
techniques. We also investigate the stability and explanation of LLMs in fault
localisation, as well as how prompt engineering and the length of code context
affect the fault localisation effectiveness. Our findings demonstrate that
within a limited code context, ChatGPT-4 outperforms all the existing fault
localisation methods. Additional error logs can further improve ChatGPT models'
localisation accuracy and stability, with an average 46.9% higher accuracy over
the state-of-the-art baseline SmartFL in terms of TOP-1 metric. However,
performance declines dramatically when the code context expands to the
class-level, with ChatGPT models' effectiveness becoming inferior to the
existing methods overall. Additionally, we observe that ChatGPT's
explainability is unsatisfactory, with an accuracy rate of only approximately
30%. These observations demonstrate that while ChatGPT can achieve effective
fault localisation performance under certain conditions, evident limitations
exist. Further research is imperative to fully harness the potential of LLMs
like ChatGPT for practical fault localisation applications.

<p class="mathjax">The scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare diseases, limits the
variability of training data and the range of detectable lesions, presenting a
significant challenge for supervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. To
solve this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised method for medical image
anomaly detection: Attention-Augmented Differentiable top-k Feature Adaptation
(ADFA). The method utilizes Wide-ResNet50-2 (WR50) network pre-trained on
ImageNet to extract initial feature representations. To reduce the channel
dimensionality while preserving relevant channel information, we employ an
attention-augmented patch descriptor on the extracted features. We then apply
differentiable top-k feature adaptation to train the patch descriptor, mapping
the extracted feature representations to a new vector space, enabling effective
detection of anomalies. Experiments show that ADFA outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods on multiple challenging medical image datasets, confirming its
effectiveness in medical anomaly detection.

<p class="mathjax">Graph homomorphism counts, first explored by Lov\'asz in 1967, have recently
garnered interest as a powerful tool in graph-based machine learning. Grohe
(PODS 2020) proposed the theoretical foundations for using homomorphism counts
in machine learning on graph level as well as node level tasks. By their very
nature, these capture local structural information, which enables the creation
of robust structural embeddings. While a first approach for graph level tasks
has been made by Nguyen and Maehara (ICML 2020), we experimentally show the
effectiveness of homomorphism count based node embeddings. Enriched with node
labels, node weights, and edge weights, these offer an interpretable
representation of graph data, allowing for enhanced explainability of machine
learning models.
<br />We propose a theoretical framework for isomorphism-invariant homomorphism
count based embeddings which lend themselves to a wide variety of downstream
tasks. Our approach capitalises on the efficient computability of graph
homomorphism counts for bounded treewidth graph classes, rendering it a
practical solution for real-world applications. We demonstrate their
expressivity through experiments on benchmark datasets. Although our results do
not match the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures, they are
comparable to other advanced graph learning models. Remarkably, our approach
demarcates itself by ensuring explainability for each individual feature. By
integrating interpretable machine learning algorithms like SVMs or Random
Forests, we establish a seamless, end-to-end explainable pipeline. Our study
contributes to the advancement of graph-based techniques that offer both
performance and interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic art analysis employs different image processing techniques to
classify and categorize works of art. When working with artistic images, we
need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image
processing. This is because such artistic paintings change drastically
depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can
result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the
whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this
paper, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image
classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present
different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of
artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable
artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the
features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules
show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how
effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that our proposed
context-aware features can achieve up to $6\%$ and $26\%$ more accurate results
than other context- and non-context-aware solutions, respectively, depending on
the specific task. We also show that some of the features used by these models
can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image than
others.

<p class="mathjax">Graph representation learning (GRL) has become a prominent tool for
furthering the understanding of complex networks providing tools for network
embedding, link prediction, and node classification. In this paper, we propose
the Hybrid Membership-Latent Distance Model (HM-LDM) by exploring how a Latent
Distance Model (LDM) can be constrained to a latent simplex. By controlling the
edge lengths of the corners of the simplex, the volume of the latent space can
be systematically controlled. Thereby communities are revealed as the space
becomes more constrained, with hard memberships being recovered as the simplex
volume goes to zero. We further explore a recent likelihood formulation for
signed networks utilizing the Skellam distribution to account for signed
weighted networks and extend the HM-LDM to the signed Hybrid Membership-Latent
Distance Model (sHM-LDM). Importantly, the induced likelihood function
explicitly attracts nodes with positive links and deters nodes from having
negative interactions. We demonstrate the utility of HM-LDM and sHM-LDM on
several real networks. We find that the procedures successfully identify
prominent distinct structures, as well as how nodes relate to the extracted
aspects providing favorable performances in terms of link prediction when
compared to prominent baselines. Furthermore, the learned soft memberships
enable easily interpretable network visualizations highlighting distinct
patterns.

a complex real-world task (such as planning a wedding) into a directed acyclic
graph over individual steps that contribute to achieving the task, with edges
specifying temporal dependencies between them. SCTD is an important component
of assistive planning tools, and a challenge for commonsense reasoning systems.
We probe how accurately SCTD can be done with the knowledge extracted from
Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce a high-quality human-annotated
dataset for this problem and novel metrics to fairly assess performance of LLMs
against several baselines. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are able to

approaches to further improve their performance, with a relative improvement of
7% to 37% over the base model. However, we find that LLMs still struggle to
predict pairwise temporal dependencies, which reveals a gap in their

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) attracts a lot of research interest and
drives widespread applications, where only anomaly-free samples are available
for training. Some UAD applications intend to further locate the anomalous
regions without any anomaly information.
<br />Although the absence of anomalous samples and annotations deteriorates the
UAD performance, an inconspicuous yet powerful statistics model, the
normalizing flows, is appropriate for anomaly detection and localization in an
unsupervised fashion. The flow-based probabilistic models, only trained on
anomaly-free data, can efficiently distinguish unpredictable anomalies by
assigning them much lower likelihoods than normal data.
<br />Nevertheless, the size variation of unpredictable anomalies introduces
another inconvenience to the flow-based methods for high-precision anomaly
detection and localization. To generalize the anomaly size variation, we
propose a novel Multi-Scale Flow-based framework dubbed MSFlow composed of
asymmetrical parallel flows followed by a fusion flow to exchange multi-scale
perceptions. Moreover, different multi-scale aggregation strategies are adopted
for image-wise anomaly detection and pixel-wise anomaly localization according
to the discrepancy between them. The proposed MSFlow is evaluated on three
anomaly detection datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods.
Notably, on the challenging MVTec AD benchmark, our MSFlow achieves a new
state-of-the-art with a detection AUORC score of up to 99.7%, localization
AUCROC score of 98.8%, and PRO score of 97.1%. The reproducible code is
available at https://github.com/cool-xuan/msflow.

Monotone Local Search - to obtain exponential approximation algorithms from
existing parameterized exact algorithms, polynomial-time approximation
algorithms and, more generally, parameterized approximation algorithms. In this
work, we generalize those results to the weighted setting.
<br />More formally, we consider monotone subset minimization problems over a
weighted universe of size $n$ (e.g., Vertex Cover, $d$-Hitting Set and Feedback
Vertex Set). We consider a model where the algorithm is only given access to a
subroutine that finds a solution of weight at most $\alpha \cdot W$ (and of
arbitrary cardinality) in time $c^k \cdot n^{O(1)}$ where $W$ is the minimum
weight of a solution of cardinality at most $k$. In the unweighted setting,
Esmer et al. determine the smallest value $d$ for which a $\beta$-approximation
algorithm running in time $d^n \cdot n^{O(1)}$ can be obtained in this model.
We show that the same dependencies also hold in a weighted setting in this
model: for every fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we obtain a $\beta$-approximation
algorithm running in time $O\left((d+\varepsilon)^{n}\right)$, for the same $d$
as in the unweighted setting.
<br />Similarly, we also extend a $\beta$-approximate brute-force search (in a
model which only provides access to a membership oracle) to the weighted
setting. Using existing approximation algorithms and exact parameterized
algorithms for weighted problems, we obtain the first exponential-time
$\beta$-approximation algorithms that are better than brute force for a variety
of problems including Weighted Vertex Cover, Weighted $d$-Hitting Set, Weighted
Feedback Vertex Set and Weighted Multicut.

<p class="mathjax">We develop and analyze a parametric registration procedure for manifolds
associated with the solutions to parametric partial differential equations in
two-dimensional domains. Given the domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and the
manifold $M=\{ u_{\mu} : \mu\in P\}$ associated with the parameter domain $P
\subset \mathbb{R}^P$ and the parametric field $\mu\mapsto u_{\mu} \in
L^2(\Omega)$, our approach takes as input a set of snapshots from $M$ and
returns a parameter-dependent mapping $\Phi: \Omega \times P \to \Omega$, which
tracks coherent features (e.g., shocks, shear layers) of the solution field and
ultimately simplifies the task of model reduction. We consider mappings of the
form $\Phi=\texttt{N}(\mathbf{a})$ where $\texttt{N}:\mathbb{R}^M \to {\rm
Lip}(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^2)$ is a suitable linear or nonlinear operator; then,
we state the registration problem as an unconstrained optimization statement
for the coefficients $\mathbf{a}$. We identify minimal requirements for the
operator $\texttt{N}$ to ensure the satisfaction of the bijectivity constraint;
we propose a class of compositional maps that satisfy the desired requirements
and enable non-trivial deformations over curved boundaries of $\Omega$; we
develop a thorough analysis of the proposed ansatz for polytopal domains and we
discuss the approximation properties for general curved domains. We perform
numerical experiments for a parametric inviscid transonic compressible flow
past a cascade of turbine blades to illustrate the many features of the method.

<p class="mathjax">We present the first extensive measurement of the privacy properties of the
advertising systems used by privacy-focused search engines. We propose an
automated methodology to study the impact of clicking on search ads on three
popular private search engines which have advertising-based business models:
StartPage, Qwant, and DuckDuckGo, and we compare them to two dominant
data-harvesting ones: Google and Bing. We investigate the possibility of third
parties tracking users when clicking on ads by analyzing first-party storage,
redirection domain paths, and requests sent before, when, and after the clicks.
Our results show that privacy-focused search engines fail to protect users'
privacy when clicking ads. Users' requests are sent through redirectors on 4%
of ad clicks on Bing, 86% of ad clicks on Qwant, and 100% of ad clicks on
Google, DuckDuckGo, and StartPage. Even worse, advertising systems collude with
advertisers across all search engines by passing unique IDs to advertisers in
most ad clicks. These IDs allow redirectors to aggregate users' activity on
ads' destination websites in addition to the activity they record when users
are redirected through them. Overall, we observe that both privacy-focused and
traditional search engines engage in privacy-harming behaviors allowing
cross-site tracking, even in privacy-enhanced browsers.

selfishly constructing an alternative longest chain. We characterize optimal
strategies employed by the adversary when a difficulty adjustment rule al\`a
Bitcoin applies. As time (namely the times-tamp specified in each block) in
most permissionless POW blockchains is somewhat subjective, we focus on two
extreme scenarios: when time is completely verifiable, and when it is

adjustment rule will find a longest-chain attack very challenging when
timestamps are verifiable. POW blockchains with frequent difficulty adjustments

<p class="mathjax">Graph convolutional networks and their variants have shown significant
promise in 3D human pose estimation. Despite their success, most of these
methods only consider spatial correlations between body joints and do not take
into account temporal correlations, thereby limiting their ability to capture
relationships in the presence of occlusions and inherent ambiguity. To address
this potential weakness, we propose a spatio-temporal network architecture
composed of a joint-mixing multi-layer perceptron block that facilitates
communication among different joints and a graph weighted Jacobi network block
that enables communication among various feature channels. The major novelty of
our approach lies in a new weighted Jacobi feature propagation rule obtained
through graph filtering with implicit fairing. We leverage temporal information
from the 2D pose sequences, and integrate weight modulation into the model to
enable untangling of the feature transformations of distinct nodes. We also
employ adjacency modulation with the aim of learning meaningful correlations
beyond defined linkages between body joints by altering the graph topology
through a learnable modulation matrix. Extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose estimation.

<p class="mathjax">We prove linear convergence for a new family of modified Dirichlet--Neumann
methods applied to quasilinear parabolic equations, as well as the convergence
of the Robin--Robin method. Such nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods
are commonly employed for the parallelization of partial differential equation
solvers. Convergence has been extensively studied for elliptic equations, but
in the case of parabolic equations there are hardly any convergence results
that are not relying on strong regularity assumptions. Hence, we construct a
new framework for analyzing domain decomposition methods applied to quasilinear
parabolic problems, based on fractional time derivatives and time-dependent
Steklov--Poincar\'e operators. The convergence analysis is conducted without
assuming restrictive regularity assumptions on the solutions or the numerical
iterates. We also prove that these continuous convergence results extend to the
discrete case obtained when combining domain decompositions with space-time
finite elements.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud-native architecture is becoming increasingly crucial for today's cloud
computing environments due to the need for speed and flexibility in developing
applications. It utilizes microservice technology to break down traditional
monolithic applications into light-weight and self-contained microservice
components. However, as microservices grow in scale and have dynamic
inter-dependencies, they also pose new challenges in resource provisioning that
cannot be fully addressed by traditional resource scheduling approaches. The
various microservices with different resource needs and latency requirements
can create complex calling chains, making it difficult to provide fine-grained
and accurate resource allocation to each component while maintaining the
overall quality of service in the chain. In this work, we aim to address the
research problem on how to efficiently provision resources for the growing
scale of microservice platform and ensure the performance of latency-critical
microservices. To address the problem, we present in-depth analyses of
Alibaba's microservice cluster and propose optimized resource provisioning
algorithms to enhance resource utilization while ensuring the latency
requirement. First, we analyze the distinct features of microservices in
Alibaba's cluster compared to traditional applications. Then we present
Alibaba's resource capacity provisioning workflow and framework to address
challenges in resource provisioning for large-scale and latency-critical
microservice clusters. Finally, we propose enhanced resource provisioning
algorithms over Alibaba's current practice by making both proactive and
reactive scheduling decisions based on different workloads patterns, which can
improve resource usage by 10-15% in Alibaba's clusters, while maintaining the
necessary latency for microservices.

<p class="mathjax">Markerless methods for animal posture tracking have been developing recently,
but frameworks and benchmarks for tracking large animal groups in 3D are still
lacking. To overcome this gap in the literature, we present 3D-MuPPET, a
framework to estimate and track 3D poses of up to 10 pigeons at interactive
speed using multiple-views. We train a pose estimator to infer 2D keypoints and
bounding boxes of multiple pigeons, then triangulate the keypoints to 3D. For
correspondence matching, we first dynamically match 2D detections to global
identities in the first frame, then use a 2D tracker to maintain
correspondences accross views in subsequent frames. We achieve comparable
accuracy to a state of the art 3D pose estimator for Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE) and Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK). We also showcase a novel use
case where our model trained with data of single pigeons provides comparable
results on data containing multiple pigeons. This can simplify the domain shift
to new species because annotating single animal data is less labour intensive
than multi-animal data. Additionally, we benchmark the inference speed of
3D-MuPPET, with up to 10 fps in 2D and 1.5 fps in 3D, and perform quantitative
tracking evaluation, which yields encouraging results. Finally, we show that
3D-MuPPET also works in natural environments without model fine-tuning on
additional annotations. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to
present a framework for 2D/3D posture and trajectory tracking that works in
both indoor and outdoor environments.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, but
their 'exposure bias' problem, described as the input mismatch between training
and sampling, lacks in-depth exploration. In this paper, we systematically
investigate the exposure bias problem in diffusion models by first analytically
modelling the sampling distribution, based on which we then attribute the
prediction error at each sampling step as the root cause of the exposure bias
issue. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to this issue and propose an
intuitive metric for it. Along with the elucidation of exposure bias, we
propose a simple, yet effective, training-free method called Epsilon Scaling to
alleviate the exposure bias. We show that Epsilon Scaling explicitly moves the
sampling trajectory closer to the vector field learned in the training phase by
scaling down the network output (Epsilon), mitigating the input mismatch
between training and sampling. Experiments on various diffusion frameworks
(ADM, DDPM/DDIM, LDM), unconditional and conditional settings, and
deterministic vs. stochastic sampling verify the effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Face parsing infers a pixel-wise label map for each semantic facial
component. Previous methods generally work well for uncovered faces, however
overlook the facial occlusion and ignore some contextual area outside a single
face, especially when facial occlusion has become a common situation during the
COVID-19 epidemic. Inspired by the illumination theory of image, we propose a
novel homogeneous tanh-transforms for image preprocessing, which made up of
four tanh-transforms, that fuse the central vision and the peripheral vision
together. Our proposed method addresses the dilemma of face parsing under
occlusion and compresses more information of surrounding context. Based on
homogeneous tanh-transforms, we propose an occlusion-aware convolutional neural
network for occluded face parsing. It combines the information both in
Tanh-polar space and Tanh-Cartesian space, capable of enhancing receptive
fields. Furthermore, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss to focus on the
boundaries of occluded regions. The network is simple and flexible, and can be
trained end-to-end. To facilitate future research of occluded face parsing, we
also contribute a new cleaned face parsing dataset, which is manually purified
from several academic or industrial datasets, including CelebAMask-HQ,
Short-video Face Parsing as well as Helen dataset and will make it public.
Experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-art methods of face
parsing under occlusion.

<p class="mathjax">Leveraging ``chain-of-thought (CoT)'' reasoning to elicit rapid and precise
responses from large language models (LLMs) is rapidly attracting research
interest. A notable challenge here is how to design or select optimal prompts.
The process of prompt selection relies on trial and error, involving continuous
adjustments and combinations of input prompts by users based on the
corresponding new responses generated from LLMs. Furthermore, minimal research
has been conducted to explore how LLMs employ the mathematical problem-solving
capabilities learned from user interactions to address issues in narrative
writing. To improve interpretability and explore the balance principle between
generality and personalization under a multi-domain CoT prompt selection
scenario, we propose the Federated Logic rule learning approach (FedLogic). We
introduce a theoretical formalization and interactive emulation of the
multi-domain CoT prompt selection dilemma in the context of federated LLMs. We
cast the problem of joint probability modeling as a bilevel program, where the
CoT prompt selection intricacy can be likened to a fuzzy score-based rule
selection with the LLMs function as rule generators. FedLogic solves this
problem through variational expectation maximization (V-EM). In addition, we
incorporate two KL-divergence constraints within this probabilistic modeling
framework to surmount the intricacies of managing extensive search spaces and
accomplishing cross-domain personalization of CoTs. To the best of our
knowledge, FedLogic is the first interpretable and principled federated
multi-domain CoT prompt selection approach for LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Building on the successes of local kernel methods for approximating the
solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) and the evaluation of
definite integrals (quadrature/cubature), a local estimate of the error in such
approximations is developed. This estimate is useful for determining locations
in the solution domain where increased node density (equivalently, reduction in
the spacing between nodes) can decrease the error in the solution. An adaptive
procedure for adding nodes to the domain for both the approximation of
derivatives and the approximate evaluation of definite integrals is described.
This method efficiently computes the error estimate at a set of prescribed
points and adds new nodes for approximation where the error is too large.
Computational experiments demonstrate close agreement between the error
estimate and actual absolute error in the approximation. Such methods are
necessary or desirable when approximating solutions to PDE (or in the case of
quadrature/cubature), where the initial data and subsequent solution (or
integrand) exhibit localized features that require significant refinement to
resolve and where uniform increases in the density of nodes across the entire
computational domain is not possible or too burdensome.

<p class="mathjax">Robust and efficient learning remains a challenging problem in robotics, in
particular with complex visual inputs. Inspired by human attention mechanism,
with which we quickly process complex visual scenes and react to changes in the
environment, we think that embedding auxiliary information about focus point
into robot learning would enhance efficiency and robustness of the learning
process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model and emulate the
human attention with an approximate prediction model. We then leverage this
output and feed it as a structured auxiliary feature map into downstream
learning tasks. We validate this idea by learning a prediction model from
human-gaze recordings of manual driving in the real world. We test our approach
on two learning tasks - object detection and imitation learning. Our
experiments demonstrate that the inclusion of predicted human attention leads
to improved robustness of the trained models to out-of-distribution samples and
faster learning in low-data regime settings. Our work highlights the potential
of incorporating structured auxiliary information in representation learning
for robotics and opens up new avenues for research in this direction. All code
and data are available online.

<p class="mathjax">The accuracy of the electric field integral equation (EFIE) can be
substantially improved using high-order discretizations. However, this equation
suffers from ill-conditioning and deleterious numerical effects in the
low-frequency regime, often jeopardizing its solution. This can be fixed using
quasi-Helmholtz decompositions, in which the source and testing elements are
separated into their solenoidal and non-solenoidal contributions, then rescaled
in order to avoid both the low-frequency conditioning breakdown and the loss of
numerical accuracy. However, standard quasi-Helmholtz decompositions require
handling discretized differential operators that often worsen the
mesh-refinement ill-conditioning and require the finding of the topological
cycles of the geometry, which can be expensive when modeling complex
scatterers, especially in high-order. This paper solves these drawbacks by
presenting the first extension of the quasi-Helmholtz projectors to high-order
discretizations and their application to the stabilization of the EFIE when
discretized with high-order basis functions. Our strategy will not require the
identification of the cycles and will provide constant condition numbers for
decreasing frequencies. Theoretical considerations will be accompanied by
numerical results showing the effectiveness of our method in complex scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Providing rich feedback to students is essential for supporting student
learning. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly within large language
modelling (LLM), provide the opportunity to deliver repeatable, scalable and
instant automatically generated feedback to students, making abundant a
previously scarce and expensive learning resource. Such an approach is feasible
from a technical perspective due to these recent advances in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP); while the potential
upside is a strong motivator, doing so introduces a range of potential ethical
issues that must be considered as we apply these technologies. The
attractiveness of AI systems is that they can effectively automate the most
mundane tasks; but this risks introducing a "tyranny of the majority", where
the needs of minorities in the long tail are overlooked because they are
difficult to automate.
<br />Developing machine learning models that can generate valuable and authentic
feedback requires the input of human domain experts. The choices we make in
capturing this expertise -- whose, which, when, and how -- will have
significant consequences for the nature of the resulting feedback. How we
maintain our models will affect how that feedback remains relevant given
temporal changes in context, theory, and prior learning profiles of student
cohorts. These questions are important from an ethical perspective; but they
are also important from an operational perspective. Unless they can be
answered, our AI generated systems will lack the trust necessary for them to be
useful features in the contemporary learning environment.
<br />This article will outline the frontiers of automated feedback, identify the
ethical issues involved in the provision of automated feedback and present a
framework to assist academics to develop such systems responsibly.

<p class="mathjax">The accuracy of coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis is dependent on a
variety of factors, including demographic, symptom, and medical examination,
ECG, and echocardiography data, among others. In this context, artificial
intelligence (AI) can help clinicians identify high-risk patients early in the
diagnostic process, by synthesizing information from multiple factors. To this
aim, Machine Learning algorithms are used to classify patients based on their
CAD disease risk. In this study, we contribute to this research filed by
developing a methodology for balancing and augmenting data for more accurate
prediction when the data is imbalanced and the sample size is small. The
methodology can be used in a variety of other situations, particularly when
data collection is expensive and the sample size is small. The experimental
results revealed that the average accuracy of our proposed method for CAD
prediction was 95.36, and was higher than random forest (RF), decision tree
(DT), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and artificial
neural network (ANN).

<p class="mathjax">Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), such as the convolutional neural
networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have been successfully applied
in the field of computer vision, they are demonstrated to be vulnerable to
well-sought Adversarial Examples (AEs) that can easily fool the DNNs. The
research in AEs has been active, and many adversarial attacks and explanations
have been proposed since they were discovered in 2014. The mystery of the AE's
existence is still an open question, and many studies suggest that DNN training
algorithms have blind spots. The salient objects usually do not overlap with
boundaries; hence, the boundaries are not the DNN model's attention.
Nevertheless, recent studies show that the boundaries can dominate the behavior
of the DNN models. Hence, this study aims to look at the AEs from a different
perspective and proposes an imperceptible adversarial attack that systemically
attacks the input image boundary for finding the AEs. The experimental results
have shown that the proposed boundary attacking method effectively attacks six
CNN models and the ViT using only 32% of the input image content (from the
boundaries) with an average success rate (SR) of 95.2% and an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio of 41.37 dB. Correlation analyses are conducted,
including the relation between the adversarial boundary's width and the SR and
how the adversarial boundary changes the DNN model's attention. This paper's
discoveries can potentially advance the understanding of AEs and provide a
different perspective on how AEs can be constructed.

<p class="mathjax">Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems.
However, existing FAS methods with handcrafted binary or pixel-wise labels have
limitations due to diverse presentation attacks (PAs). In this paper, we
propose an attack type robust face anti-spoofing framework under light flash,
called ATR-FAS. Due to imaging differences caused by various attack types,
traditional FAS methods based on single binary classification network may
result in excessive intra-class distance of spoof faces, leading to a challenge
of decision boundary learning. Therefore, we employed multiple networks to
reconstruct multi-frame depth maps as auxiliary supervision, and each network
experts in one type of attack. A dual gate module (DGM) consisting of a type
gate and a frame-attention gate is introduced, which perform attack type
recognition and multi-frame attention generation, respectively. The outputs of
DGM are utilized as weight to mix the result of multiple expert networks. The
multi-experts mixture enables ATR-FAS to generate spoof-differentiated depth
maps, and stably detects spoof faces without being affected by different types
of PAs. Moreover, we design a differential normalization procedure to convert
original flash frames into differential frames. This simple but effective
processing enhances the details in flash frames, aiding in the generation of
depth maps. To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we collected a
large-scale dataset containing 12,660 live and spoof videos with diverse PAs
under dynamic flash from the smartphone screen. Extensive experiments
illustrate that the proposed ATR-FAS significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be available at
https://github.com/Chaochao-Lin/ATR-FAS.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchains offer strong security gurarantees, but cannot protect users
against the ordering of transactions. Players such as miners, bots and
validators can reorder various transactions and reap significant profits,
called the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). In this paper, we propose an MEV
aware protocol design called Masquerade, and show that it will increase user
satisfaction and confidence in the system. We propose a strict per-transaction
level of ordering to ensure that a transaction is committed either way even if
it is revealed. In this protocol, we introduce the notion of a "token" to
mitigate the actions taken by an adversary in an attack scenario. Such tokens
can be purchased voluntarily by users, who can then choose to include the token
numbers in their transactions. If the users include the token in their
transactions, then our protocol requires the block-builder to order the
transactions strictly according to token numbers. We show through extensive
simulations that this reduces the probability that the adversaries can benefit
from MEV transactions as compared to existing current practices.

<p class="mathjax">An accurate data-based prediction of the long-term evolution of Hamiltonian
systems requires a network that preserves the appropriate structure under each
time step. Every Hamiltonian system contains two essential ingredients: the
Poisson bracket and the Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian systems with symmetries, whose
paradigm examples are the Lie-Poisson systems, have been shown to describe a
broad category of physical phenomena, from satellite motion to underwater
vehicles, fluids, geophysical applications, complex fluids, and plasma physics.
The Poisson bracket in these systems comes from the symmetries, while the
Hamiltonian comes from the underlying physics. We view the symmetry of the
system as primary, hence the Lie-Poisson bracket is known exactly, whereas the
Hamiltonian is regarded as coming from physics and is considered not known, or
known approximately. Using this approach, we develop a network based on
transformations that exactly preserve the Poisson bracket and the special
functions of the Lie-Poisson systems (Casimirs) to machine precision. We
present two flavors of such systems: one, where the parameters of
transformations are computed from data using a dense neural network (LPNets),
and another, where the composition of transformations is used as building
blocks (G-LPNets). We also show how to adapt these methods to a larger class of
Poisson brackets. We apply the resulting methods to several examples, such as
rigid body (satellite) motion, underwater vehicles, a particle in a magnetic
field, and others. The methods developed in this paper are important for the
construction of accurate data-based methods for simulating the long-term
dynamics of physical systems.

cultural differences on Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms.
We compared predictions from two common explanations about cultural differences
in China (economic development and urban-rural differences) against the
less-obvious legacy of rice versus wheat farming. Rice farmers had to
coordinate shared irrigation networks and exchange labor to cope with higher
labor requirements. In contrast, wheat relied on rainfall and required half as
much labor. We test whether this legacy made southern China more
interdependent. Across all word categories, rice explained twice as much
variance as economic development and urbanization. Rice areas used more words
reflecting tight social ties, holistic thought, and a cautious, prevention
orientation. We then used Twitter data comparing prefectures in Japan, which
largely replicated the results from China. This provides crucial evidence of
the rice theory in a different nation, language, and platform.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) plays a crucial role in object detection
when adapting a source-trained detector to a target domain without annotated
data. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective four-step UDA approach
that leverages self-supervision and trains source and target data concurrently.
We harness self-supervised learning to mitigate the lack of ground truth in the
target domain. Our method consists of the following steps: (1) identify the
region with the highest-confidence set of detections in each target image,
which serve as our pseudo-labels; (2) crop the identified region and generate a
collection of its augmented versions; (3) combine these latter into a composite
image; (4) adapt the network to the target domain using the composed image.
Through extensive experiments under cross-camera, cross-weather, and
synthetic-to-real scenarios, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving upon the nearest competitor by more than 2% in terms of
mean Average Precision (mAP). The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">New 3+1D high-resolution radar sensors are gaining importance for 3D object
detection in the automotive domain due to their relative affordability and
improved detection compared to classic low-resolution radar sensors. One
limitation of high-resolution radar sensors, compared to lidar sensors, is the
sparsity of the generated point cloud. This sparsity could be partially
overcome by accumulating radar point clouds of subsequent time steps. This
contribution analyzes limitations of accumulating radar point clouds on the
View-of-Delft dataset. By employing different ego-motion estimation approaches,
the dataset's inherent constraints, and possible solutions are analyzed.
Additionally, a learning-based instance motion estimation approach is deployed
to investigate the influence of dynamic motion on the accumulated point cloud
for object detection. Experiments document an improved object detection
performance by applying an ego-motion estimation and dynamic motion correction
approach.

<p class="mathjax">An important aspect in jointly analysing networked control systems and their
communication is to model the networking in a sufficiently rich but at the same
time mathematically tractable way. As such, this paper improves on a recently
proposed scalable approach for analysing multi-agent systems with stochastic
packet loss by allowing for heterogeneous transmission probabilities and
temporal correlation in the communication model. The key idea is to consider
the transmission probabilities as uncertain, which facilitates the use of tools
from robust control. Due to being formulated in terms of linear matrix
inequalities that grow linearly with the number of agents, the result is
applicable to very large multi-agent systems, which is demonstrated by
numerical simulations with up to 10000 agents.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for Text-to-SQL
task. However, the absence of a systematical benchmark inhibits the development
of designing effective, efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solutions.
To address this challenge, in this paper, we first conduct a systematical and
extensive comparison over existing prompt engineering methods, including
question representation, example selection and example organization, and with
these experimental results, we elaborates their pros and cons. Based on these
findings, we propose a new integrated solution, named DAIL-SQL, which refreshes
the Spider leaderboard with 86.6% execution accuracy and sets a new bar.
Towards an efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solution, we emphasize
the token efficiency in prompt engineering and compare the prior studies under
this metric. Additionally, we investigate open-source LLMs in in-context
learning, and further enhance their performance with task-specific supervised
fine-tuning. Our explorations highlight open-source LLMs' potential in
Text-to-SQL, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the task-specific
supervised fine-tuning. We hope that our work provides a deeper understanding
of Text-to-SQL with LLMs, and inspire further investigations and broad
applications.

for modeling multiple heterogeneous correlated tasks jointly, e.g.,

<p class="mathjax">Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) such as MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA have
demonstrated the capability of understanding images and achieved remarkable
performance in various visual tasks. Despite their strong abilities in
recognizing common objects due to extensive training datasets, they lack
specific domain knowledge and have a weaker understanding of localized details
within objects, which hinders their effectiveness in the Industrial Anomaly
Detection (IAD) task. On the other hand, most existing IAD methods only provide
anomaly scores and necessitate the manual setting of thresholds to distinguish
between normal and abnormal samples, which restricts their practical
implementation. In this paper, we explore the utilization of LVLM to address
the IAD problem and propose AnomalyGPT, a novel IAD approach based on LVLM. We
generate training data by simulating anomalous images and producing
corresponding textual descriptions for each image. We also employ an image
decoder to provide fine-grained semantic and design a prompt learner to
fine-tune the LVLM using prompt embeddings. Our AnomalyGPT eliminates the need
for manual threshold adjustments, thus directly assesses the presence and
locations of anomalies. Additionally, AnomalyGPT supports multi-turn dialogues
and exhibits impressive few-shot in-context learning capabilities. With only
one normal shot, AnomalyGPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an
accuracy of 86.1%, an image-level AUC of 94.1%, and a pixel-level AUC of 95.3%
on the MVTec-AD dataset. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) emerges as a decentralized learning framework which
trains models from multiple distributed clients without sharing their data to
preserve privacy. Recently, large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., Vision
Transformer) have shown a strong capability of deriving robust representations.
However, the data heterogeneity among clients, the limited computation
resources, and the communication bandwidth restrict the deployment of
large-scale models in FL frameworks. To leverage robust representations from
large-scale models while enabling efficient model personalization for
heterogeneous clients, we propose a novel personalized FL framework of
client-specific Prompt Generation (pFedPG), which learns to deploy a
personalized prompt generator at the server for producing client-specific
visual prompts that efficiently adapts frozen backbones to local data
distributions. Our proposed framework jointly optimizes the stages of
personalized prompt adaptation locally and personalized prompt generation
globally. The former aims to train visual prompts that adapt foundation models
to each client, while the latter observes local optimization directions to
generate personalized prompts for all clients. Through extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets, we show that our pFedPG is favorable against
state-of-the-art personalized FL methods under various types of data
heterogeneity, allowing computation and communication efficient model
personalization.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent robots are designed to effectively navigate dynamic and
unpredictable environments laden with moving mechanical elements and objects.
Such environment-induced dynamics, including moving obstacles, can readily
alter the computational demand (e.g., the creation of new tasks) and the
structure of workloads (e.g., precedence constraints among tasks) during
runtime, thereby adversely affecting overall system performance. This challenge
is amplified when multi-task inference is expected on robots operating under
stringent resource and real-time constraints. To address such a challenge, we
introduce RED, a systematic real-time scheduling approach designed to support
multi-task deep neural network workloads in resource-limited robotic systems.
It is designed to adaptively manage the Robotic Environmental Dynamics (RED)
while adhering to real-time constraints. At the core of RED lies a
deadline-based scheduler that employs an intermediate deadline assignment
policy, effectively managing to change workloads and asynchronous inference
prompted by complex, unpredictable environments. This scheduling framework also
facilitates the flexible deployment of MIMONet (multi-input multi-output neural
networks), which are commonly utilized in multi-tasking robotic systems to
circumvent memory bottlenecks. Building on this scheduling framework, RED
recognizes and leverages a unique characteristic of MIMONet: its weight-shared
architecture. To further accommodate and exploit this feature, RED devises a
novel and effective workload refinement and reconstruction process. This
process ensures the scheduling framework's compatibility with MIMONet and
maximizes efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">A data-driven projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) for nonlinear
thermal radiative transfer (TRT) problems is presented. The TRT ROM is
formulated by (i) a hierarchy of low-order quasidiffusion (aka variable
Eddington factor) equations for moments of the radiation intensity and (ii) the
normalized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). The multilevel system of moment
equations is derived by projection of the BTE onto a sequence of subspaces
which represent elements of the phase space of the problem. Exact closure for
the moment equations is provided by the Eddington tensor. A Petrov-Galerkin
(PG) projection of the normalized BTE is formulated using a proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) basis representing the normalized radiation intensity over
the whole phase space and time. The Eddington tensor linearly depends on the
solution of the normalized BTE. By linear superposition of the POD basis
functions, a low-rank expansion of the Eddington tensor is constructed with
coefficients defined by the PG projected normalized BTE. The material energy
balance (MEB) equation is coupled with the effective grey low-order equations
which exist on the same dimensional scale as the MEB equation. The resulting
TRT ROM is structure and asymptotic preserving. A detailed analysis of the ROM
is performed on the classical Fleck-Cummings (F-C) TRT multigroup test problem
in 2D geometry. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the ROM's
effectiveness in the simulation of radiation wave phenomena. The ROM is shown
to produce solutions with sufficiently high accuracy while using low-rank
approximation of the normalized BTE solution. Essential physical
characteristics of supersonic radiation wave are preserved in the ROM
solutions.

<p class="mathjax">The robustness of object detection models is a major concern when applied to
real-world scenarios. However, the performance of most object detection models
degrades when applied to images subjected to corruptions, since they are
usually trained and evaluated on clean datasets. Enhancing the robustness of
object detection models is of utmost importance, especially for those designed
for aerial images, which feature complex backgrounds, substantial variations in
scales and orientations of objects. This paper addresses the challenge of
assessing the robustness of object detection models in aerial images, with a
specific emphasis on scenarios where images are affected by clouds. In this
study, we introduce two novel benchmarks based on DOTA-v1.0. The first
benchmark encompasses 19 prevalent corruptions, while the second focuses on
cloud-corrupted images-a phenomenon uncommon in natural pictures yet frequent
in aerial photography. We systematically evaluate the robustness of mainstream
object detection models and perform numerous ablation experiments. Through our
investigations, we find that enhanced model architectures, larger networks,
well-crafted modules, and judicious data augmentation strategies collectively
enhance the robustness of aerial object detection models. The benchmarks we
propose and our comprehensive experimental analyses can facilitate research on
robust object detection in aerial images. Codes and datasets are available at:

<p class="mathjax">Winner Take All (WTA) circuits a type of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have
been suggested as facilitating the brain's ability to process information in a
Bayesian manner. Research has shown that WTA circuits are capable of
approximating hierarchical Bayesian models via Expectation Maximization (EM).
So far, research in this direction has focused on bottom up processes. This is
contrary to neuroscientific evidence that shows that, besides bottom up
processes, top down processes too play a key role in information processing by
the human brain. Several functions ascribed to top down processes include
direction of attention, adjusting for expectations, facilitation of encoding
and recall of learned information, and imagery. This paper explores whether WTA
circuits are suitable for further integrating information represented in
separate WTA networks. Furthermore, it explores whether, and under what
circumstances, top down processes can improve WTA network performance with
respect to inference and learning. The results show that WTA circuits are
capable of integrating the probabilistic information represented by other WTA
networks, and that top down processes can improve a WTA network's inference and
learning performance. Notably, it is able to do this according to key
neuromorphic principles, making it ideal for low-latency and energy efficient
implementation on neuromorphic hardware.

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops a Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(Dec-MARL) method to solve the SoC balancing problem in the distributed energy
storage system (DESS). First, the SoC balancing problem is formulated into a
finite Markov decision process with action constraints derived from demand
balance, which can be solved by Dec-MARL. Specifically, the first-order average
consensus algorithm is utilized to expand the observations of the DESS state in
a fully-decentralized way, and the initial actions (i.e., output power) are
decided by the agents (i.e., energy storage units) according to these
observations. In order to get the final actions in the allowable range, a
counterfactual demand balance algorithm is proposed to balance the total demand
and the initial actions. Next, the agents execute the final actions and get
local rewards from the environment, and the DESS steps into the next state.
Finally, through the first-order average consensus algorithm, the agents get
the average reward and the expended observation of the next state for later
training. By the above procedure, Dec-MARL reveals outstanding performance in a
fully-decentralized system without any expert experience or constructing any
complicated model. Besides, it is flexible and can be extended to other
decentralized multi-agent systems straightforwardly. Extensive simulations have
validated the effectiveness and efficiency of Dec-MARL.

<p class="mathjax">In drug discovery, mapping interactions between genes within cellular systems
is a crucial early step. This helps formulate hypotheses regarding molecular
mechanisms that could potentially be targeted by future medicines. The
CausalBench Challenge was an initiative to invite the machine learning
community to advance the state of the art in constructing gene-gene interaction
networks. These networks, derived from large-scale, real-world datasets of
single cells under various perturbations, are crucial for understanding the
causal mechanisms underlying disease biology. Using the framework provided by
the CausalBench benchmark, participants were tasked with enhancing the capacity
of the state of the art methods to leverage large-scale genetic perturbation
data. This report provides an analysis and summary of the methods submitted
during the challenge to give a partial image of the state of the art at the
time of the challenge. The winning solutions significantly improved performance
compared to previous baselines, establishing a new state of the art for this
critical task in biology and medicine.

<p class="mathjax">Color is the most important intrinsic sensory feature that has a powerful
impact on product sales. Color is even responsible for raising the aesthetic
senses in our brains. Account for individual differences is crucial in color
aesthetics. It requires user-driven mechanisms for various e-commerce
applications. We propose a method for quantitative evaluation of all types of
perceptual responses to color(s): distinct color preference, color harmony, and
color combination preference. Preference for color schemes can be predicted by
combining preferences for the basic colors and ratings of color harmony.
Harmonious pallets are extracted from big data set using comparison algorithms
based on fuzzy similarity and grouping. The proposed model results in useful
predictions of harmony and preference of multicolored images. For example, in
the context of apparel coordination, it allows predicting a preference for a
look based on clothing colors. Our approach differs from standard aesthetic
models, since in accounts for a personal variation. In addition, it can process
not only lower-order color pairs, but also groups of several colors.

<p class="mathjax">Making moral judgments is an essential step toward developing ethical AI
systems. Prevalent approaches are mostly implemented in a bottom-up manner,
which uses a large set of annotated data to train models based on crowd-sourced
opinions about morality. These approaches have been criticized for potentially
overgeneralizing a limited group of annotators' moral stances and lacking
explainability. In contrast, top-down approaches make moral judgments grounded
in a set of principles. However, it remains conceptual due to the incapability
of previous language models and the unsolved debate among moral principles. In
this study, we propose a flexible framework to steer Large Language Models
(LLMs) to perform moral reasoning with well-established moral theories from
interdisciplinary research. The theory-guided top-down framework can
incorporate various moral theories. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework on datasets derived from moral
theories. Furthermore, we show the alignment between different moral theories
and existing morality datasets. Our analysis exhibits the potentials and flaws
in existing resources (models and datasets) in developing explainable moral
judgment-making systems.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we couple a high-accuracy phase-field fracture reconstruction
approach iteratively to fluid-structure interaction. The key motivation is to
utilize phase-field modelling to compute the fracture path. A mesh
reconstruction allows a switch from interface-capturing to interface-tracking
in which the coupling conditions can be realized in a highly accurate fashion.
Consequently, inside the fracture, a Stokes flow can be modelled that is
coupled to the surrounding elastic medium. A fully coupled approach is obtained
by iterating between the phase-field and the fluid-structure interaction model.
The resulting algorithm is demonstrated for several numerical examples of
quasi-static brittle fractures. We consider both stationary and
quasi-stationary problems. In the latter, the dynamics arise through an
incrementally-increasing given pressure.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider sampling an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process
through a channel for remote estimation. The goal is to minimize the mean
square error (MSE) at the estimator under a sampling frequency constraint when
the channel delay statistics is unknown. Sampling for MSE minimization is
reformulated into an optimal stopping problem. By revisiting the threshold
structure of the optimal stopping policy when the delay statistics is known, we
propose an online sampling algorithm to learn the optimum threshold using
stochastic approximation algorithm and the virtual queue method. We prove that
with probability 1, the MSE of the proposed online algorithm converges to the
minimum MSE that is achieved when the channel delay statistics is known. The
cumulative MSE gap of our proposed algorithm compared with the minimum MSE up
to the $(k+1)$-th sample grows with rate at most $\mathcal{O}(\ln k)$. Our
proposed online algorithm can satisfy the sampling frequency constraint
theoretically. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm.

of sign language recognition and translation technologies. In this paper, we
introduce Bornil; a crowdsource-friendly, multilingual sign language data
collection, annotation, and validation platform. Bornil allows users to record
sign language gestures and lets annotators perform sentence and gloss-level
annotation. It also allows validators to make sure of the quality of both the
recorded videos and the annotations through manual validation to develop
high-quality datasets for deep learning-based Automatic Sign Language
Recognition. To demonstrate the system's efficacy; we collected the largest
sign language dataset for Bangladeshi Sign Language dialect, perform deep

<p class="mathjax">A code $C \colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ is a $q$-locally decodable code
($q$-LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit $b_i$ of the message $b \in
\{0,1\}^k$ with good confidence by randomly querying the encoding $x := C(b)$
on at most $q$ coordinates. Existing constructions of $2$-LDCs achieve $n =
\exp(O(k))$, and lower bounds show that this is in fact tight. However, when $q
= 3$, far less is known: the best constructions achieve $n = \exp(k^{o(1)})$,
while the best known results only show a quadratic lower bound $n \geq
\tilde{\Omega}(k^2)$ on the blocklength.
<br />In this paper, we prove a near-cubic lower bound of $n \geq
\tilde{\Omega}(k^3)$ on the blocklength of $3$-query LDCs. This improves on the
best known prior works by a polynomial factor in $k$. Our proof relies on a new
connection between LDCs and refuting constraint satisfaction problems with
limited randomness. Our quantitative improvement builds on the new techniques
for refuting semirandom instances of CSPs developed in [GKM22, HKM23] and, in
particular, relies on bounding the spectral norm of appropriate Kikuchi
matrices.

<p class="mathjax">Data in the real-world classification problems are always imbalanced or
long-tailed, wherein the majority classes have the most of the samples that
dominate the model training. In such setting, the naive model tends to have
poor performance on the minority classes. Previously, a variety of loss
modifications have been proposed to address the long-tailed leaning problem,
while these methods either treat the samples in the same class
indiscriminatingly or lack a theoretical guarantee. In this paper, we propose
two novel approaches based on CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) to improve the
performance of long-tailed learning with a solid theoretical ground.
Specifically, we firstly introduce a Label-Aware Bounded CVaR (LAB-CVaR) loss
to overcome the pessimistic result of the original CVaR, and further design the
optimal weight bounds for LAB-CVaR theoretically. Based on LAB-CVaR, we
additionally propose a LAB-CVaR with logit adjustment (LAB-CVaR-logit) loss to
stabilize the optimization process, where we also offer the theoretical
support. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with long-tailed label
distributions verify the superiority of our proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">It is well known that the numerical solution of the Non-Fickian flows at the
current stage depends on all previous time instances. Consequently, the storage
requirement increases linearly, while the computational complexity grows
quadratically with the number of time steps. This presents a significant
challenge for numerical simulations, and to the best of our knowledge, it
remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we present a memory-free algorithm,
based on the incremental SVD technique, that exhibits only linear growth in
computational complexity as the number of time steps increases. We prove that
the error between the solutions generated by the conventional algorithm and our
innovative approach lies within the scope of machine error. Numerical
experiments are showcased to affirm the accuracy and efficiency gains in terms
of both memory usage and computational expenses.

<p class="mathjax">There have been recent efforts to learn more meaningful representations via
fixed length codewords from mesh data, since a mesh serves as a complete model
of underlying 3D shape compared to a point cloud. However, the mesh
connectivity presents new difficulties when constructing a deep learning
pipeline for meshes. Previous mesh unsupervised learning approaches typically
assume category-specific templates, e.g., human face/body templates. It
restricts the learned latent codes to only be meaningful for objects in a
specific category, so the learned latent spaces are unable to be used across
different types of objects. In this work, we present WrappingNet, the first
mesh autoencoder enabling general mesh unsupervised learning over heterogeneous
objects. It introduces a novel base graph in the bottleneck dedicated to
representing mesh connectivity, which is shown to facilitate learning a shared
latent space representing object shape. The superiority of WrappingNet mesh
learning is further demonstrated via improved reconstruction quality and
competitive classification compared to point cloud learning, as well as latent
interpolation between meshes of different categories.

<p class="mathjax">Given a straight-line drawing of a graph, a {\em segment} is a maximal set of
edges that form a line segment. Given a planar graph $G$, the {\em segment
number} of $G$ is the minimum number of segments that can be achieved by any
planar straight-line drawing of $G$. The {\em line cover number} of $G$ is the
minimum number of lines that support all the edges of a planar straight-line
drawing of $G$. Computing the segment number or the line cover number of a
planar graph is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete and, thus, NP-hard.
<br />We study the problem of computing the segment number from the perspective of
parameterized complexity. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter
tractable with respect to each of the following parameters: the vertex cover
number, the segment number, and the line cover number. We also consider colored
versions of the segment and the line cover number.

<p class="mathjax">How do language models learn to make predictions during pre-training? To
study this question, we extract learning curves from five autoregressive
English language model pre-training runs, for 1M tokens in context. We observe
that the language models generate short repetitive phrases before learning to
generate longer and more coherent text. We quantify the final surprisal,
within-run variability, age of acquisition, forgettability, and cross-run
variability of learning curves for individual tokens in context. More frequent
tokens reach lower final surprisals, exhibit less variability within and across
pre-training runs, are learned earlier, and are less likely to be "forgotten"
during pre-training. Higher n-gram probabilities further accentuate these
effects. Independent of the target token, shorter and more frequent contexts
correlate with marginally more stable and quickly acquired predictions. Effects
of part-of-speech are also small, although nouns tend to be acquired later and
less stably than verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Our work contributes to a
better understanding of language model pre-training dynamics and informs the
deployment of stable language models in practice.

focusing on its use in music &amp; speech synthesis. We catalogue applications to
tasks including music performance rendering, sound matching, and voice

<p class="mathjax">Mission profiles describe a representative set of conditions that a power
converter is designed to operate under, and are known to be more complicated
for multiport converter applications due to a wider range of combinations of
powers that can be transferred between ports. This paper studies the properties
of mission profiles derived from operational optimization of multiport
converters in distribution system applications (e.g., soft open points). The
electrical cardinality of the mission profile is introduced as a useful,
naturally varying property of multiport mission profiles derived from optimal
operation within distribution system, with the cardinality equal to the number
of non-zero power transfers at a given time. Furthermore, it is shown that the
cardinality can be conveniently constrained within the framework of
conventional mixed-integer conic optimization problems, yielding a family of
mission profiles that can enable converter designers to simplify multiport
designs via converter reconfiguration. Results demonstrate the potential to
reduce the cardinality in a four-terminal multiport converter from four to two
whilst still effectively supporting congestion management and achieving 91.7%
of the loss reduction capabilities of a conventional design.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of this paper is to combine several Ivev-like modal systems
characterized by 4-valued non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices) with IDM4, a
4-valued expansion of Belnap-Dunn's logic FDE with an implication introduced by
Pynko in 1999. In order to to this, we introduce a new methodology for
combining logics which are characterized by means of swap structures, based on
what we call superposition of snapshots. In particular, the combination of IDM4
with Tm, the 4-valued Ivlev's version of KT, will be analyzed with more
details. From the semantical perspective, the idea is to combine the 4-valued
swap structures (Nmatrices) for Tm (and several of its extensions) with the
4-valued twist structure (logical matrix) for IDM4. This superposition produces
a universe of 6 snapshots, with 3 of them being designated. The multioperators
over the new universe are defined by combining the specifications of the given
swap and twist structures. This gives origin to 6 different paradefinite
Ivlev-like modal logics, each one of them characterized by a 6-valued Nmatrix,
and conservatively extending the original modal logic and IDM4. This important
feature allows us to consider the proposed construction as a genuine technique
for combining logics. In addition, it is possible to define in the combined
logics a classicality operator in the sense of logics of evidence and truth
(LETs). A sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatization is also presented for
the 6 combined systems, as well as a very simple Prolog program which
implements the swap structures semantics for the 6 systems, which gives a
decision procedure for satisfiability, refutability and validity of formulas in
these logics.

<p class="mathjax">High-Definition (HD) maps play a crucial role in autonomous driving systems.
Recent methods have attempted to construct HD maps in real-time based on
information obtained from vehicle onboard sensors. However, the performance of
these methods is significantly susceptible to the environment surrounding the
vehicle due to the inherent limitation of onboard sensors, such as weak
capacity for long-range detection. In this study, we demonstrate that
supplementing onboard sensors with satellite maps can enhance the performance
of HD map construction methods, leveraging the broad coverage capability of
satellite maps. For the purpose of further research, we release the satellite
map tiles as a complementary dataset of nuScenes dataset. Meanwhile, we propose
a hierarchical fusion module that enables better fusion of satellite maps
information with existing methods. Specifically, we design an attention mask
based on segmentation and distance, applying the cross-attention mechanism to
fuse onboard Bird's Eye View (BEV) features and satellite features in
feature-level fusion. An alignment module is introduced before concatenation in
BEV-level fusion to mitigate the impact of misalignment between the two
features. The experimental results on the augmented nuScenes dataset showcase
the seamless integration of our module into three existing HD map construction
methods. It notably enhances their performance in both HD map semantic
segmentation and instance detection tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The IEEE VIS Conference (or VIS) hosts more than 1000 people annually. It
brings together visualization researchers and practitioners from across the
world to share new research and knowledge. Behind the scenes, a team of
volunteers puts together the entire conference and makes sure it runs smoothly.
Organizing involves logistics of the conference, ensuring that the attendees
have an enjoyable time, allocating rooms to multiple concurrent tracks, and
keeping the conference within budget. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic
has abruptly disrupted plans, forcing organizers to switch to virtual, hybrid,
and satellite formats. These alternatives offer many benefits: fewer costs
(e.g., travel, venue, institutional), greater accessibility (who can physically
travel, who can get visas, who can get child care), and a lower carbon
footprint (as people do not need to fly to attend). As many conferences begin
to revert to the pre-pandemic status quo of primarily in-person conferences, we
suggest that it is an opportune moment to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks
of lower-carbon conference formats. To learn more about the logistics of
conference organizing, we talked to 6 senior executive-level VIS organizers. We
review some of the many considerations that go into planning, particularly with
regard to how they influence decisions about alternative formats. We aim to
start a discussion about the sustainability of VIS -- including sustainability
for finance, volunteers, and, central to this work, the environment -- for the
next three years and the next three hundred years.

to speed up kernel methods in large scale algorithms and provides a theoretical
approach to the analysis of deep neural networks. We analyze generalization
properties for a large class of spectral regularization methods combined with
random features, containing kernel methods with implicit regularization such as
gradient descent or explicit methods like Tikhonov regularization. For our
estimators we obtain optimal learning rates over regularity classes (even for
classes that are not included in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space), which
are defined through appropriate source conditions. This improves or completes

<p class="mathjax">In the $t$-online-erasure model in property testing, an adversary is allowed
to erase $t$ values of a queried function for each query the tester makes. This
model was recently formulated by Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova andVarma, who showed
that the properties of linearity of functions as well as quadraticity can be
tested in$O_t(1)$ many queries: $O(\log (t))$ for linearity and $2^{2^{O(t)}}$
for quadraticity. They asked whether the more general property of
low-degreeness can be tested in the online erasure model, whether better
testers exist for quadraticity, and if similar results hold when ``erasures''
are replaced with ``corruptions''.
<br />We show that, in the $t$-online-erasure model, for a prime power $q$, given
query access to a function $f: \mathbb{F}_q^n \xrightarrow[]{} \mathbb{F}_q$,
one can distinguish in $\mathrm{poly}(\log^{d+q}(t)/\delta)$ queries between
the case that $f$ is degree at most $d$, and the case that $f$ is $\delta$-far
from any degree $d$ function (with respect to the fractional hamming distance).
This answers the aforementioned questions and brings the query complexity to
nearly match the query complexity of low-degree testing in the classical
property testing model. Our results are based on the observation that the
property of low-degreeness admits a large and versatile family of query
efficient testers. Our testers operates by querying a uniformly random,
sufficiently large set of points in a large enough affine subspace, and finding
a tester for low-degreeness that only utilizes queries from that set of points.
<br />We believe that this tester may find other applications to algorithms in the
online-erasure model or other related models, and may be of independent
interest.

<p class="mathjax">Enumeration problems are often encountered as key subroutines in the exact
computation of graph parameters such as chromatic number, treewidth, or
treedepth. In the case of treedepth computation, the enumeration of
inclusion-wise minimal separators plays a crucial role. However and quite
surprisingly, the complexity status of this problem has not been settled since
it has been posed as an open direction by Kloks and Kratsch in 1998. Recently
at the PACE 2020 competition dedicated to treedepth computation, solvers have
been circumventing that by listing all minimal $a$-$b$ separators and filtering
out those that are not inclusion-wise minimal, at the cost of efficiency.
Naturally, having an efficient algorithm for listing inclusion-wise minimal
separators would drastically improve such practical algorithms. In this note,
however, we show that no efficient algorithm is to be expected from an
output-sensitive perspective, namely, we prove that there is no
output-polynomial time algorithm for inclusion-wise minimal separators
enumeration unless P = NP.

<p class="mathjax">Binary similarity analysis determines if two binary executables are from the
same source program. Existing techniques leverage static and dynamic program
features and may utilize advanced Deep Learning techniques. Although they have
demonstrated great potential, the community believes that a more effective
representation of program semantics can further improve similarity analysis. In
this paper, we propose a new method to represent binary program semantics. It
is based on a novel probabilistic execution engine that can effectively sample
the input space and the program path space of subject binaries. More
importantly, it ensures that the collected samples are comparable across
binaries, addressing the substantial variations of input specifications. Our
evaluation on 9 real-world projects with 35k functions, and comparison with 6
state-of-the-art techniques show that PEM can achieve a precision of 96% with
common settings, outperforming the baselines by 10-20%.

<p class="mathjax">The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal
role in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence. Although there are
effective methods like program-of-thought prompting for LLMs which uses
programming language to tackle complex reasoning tasks, the specific impact of
code data on the improvement of reasoning capabilities remains under-explored.
To address this gap, we propose complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS),
which combines structural and logical attributes, to measure the correlation
between code and reasoning abilities. Specifically, we use the abstract syntax
tree to encode the structural information and calculate logical complexity by
considering the difficulty and the cyclomatic complexity. Through an empirical
analysis, we find not all code data of complexity can be learned or understood
by LLMs. Optimal level of complexity is critical to the improvement of
reasoning abilities by program-aided prompting. Then we design an
auto-synthesizing and stratifying algorithm, and apply it to instruction
generation for mathematical reasoning and code data filtering for code
generation tasks. Extensive results demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Code will be integrated into the EasyInstruct framework at
https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a deterministic approach to edge detection and image
segmentation by formulating pseudo-Boolean polynomials on image patches. The
approach works by applying a binary classification of blob and edge regions in
an image based on the degrees of pseudo-Boolean polynomials calculated on
patches extracted from the provided image. We test our method on simple images
containing primitive shapes of constant and contrasting colour and establish
the feasibility before applying it to complex instances like aerial landscape
images. The proposed method is based on the exploitation of the reduction,
polynomial degree, and equivalence properties of penalty-based pseudo-Boolean

<p class="mathjax">A sensor observes a random phenomenon and transmits updates about the
observed phenomenon to a remote monitor. The sensor may experience intermittent
failures in which case the monitor will not receive any updates until the
sensor has recovered. The monitor wants to keep a timely view of the observed
process, as well as to detect any sensor failures, using the timings of the
updates. We analyze this system model from a goal-oriented and semantic
communication point of view, where the communication has multiple goals and
multiple meanings/semantics. For the first goal, the performance is quantified
by the age of information of the observed process at the monitor. For the
second goal, the performance is quantified by the probability of error of the
monitor's estimation of the sensor's failure status. Each arriving update
packet brings both an information update and an indication about the sensor's
status. The monitor estimates the failure status of the sensor by using the
timings of the received updates. This estimation is subject to error, since a
long period without any update receptions may be due to a low update rate or a
failure of the sensor. We examine the trade-off between these two goals. We
show that the probability of error of estimating a sensor failure decreases
with increased update rate, however, the age of information is minimized with
an intermediate update rate (not too low or high).

<p class="mathjax">Given imbalanced data, it is hard to train a good classifier using deep
learning because of the poor generalization of minority classes. Traditionally,
the well-known synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) for data
augmentation, a data mining approach for imbalanced learning, has been used to
improve this generalization. However, it is unclear whether SMOTE also benefits
deep learning. In this work, we study why the original SMOTE is insufficient
for deep learning, and enhance SMOTE using soft labels. Connecting the
resulting soft SMOTE with Mixup, a modern data augmentation technique, leads to
a unified framework that puts traditional and modern data augmentation
techniques under the same umbrella. A careful study within this framework shows
that Mixup improves generalization by implicitly achieving uneven margins
between majority and minority classes. We then propose a novel margin-aware
Mixup technique that more explicitly achieves uneven margins. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed technique yields
state-of-the-art performance on deep imbalanced classification while achieving
superior performance on extremely imbalanced data. The code is open-sourced in
our developed package https://github.com/ntucllab/imbalanced-DL to foster
future research in this direction.

<p class="mathjax">One-shot direct model-reference control design techniques, like the Virtual
Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) approach, offer time-saving solutions for the
calibration of fixed-structure controllers for dynamic systems. Nonetheless,
such methods are known to be highly sensitive to the quality of the available
data, often requiring long and costly experiments to attain acceptable
closed-loop performance. These features might prevent the widespread adoption
of such techniques, especially in low-data regimes. In this paper, we argue
that the inherent similarity of many industrially relevant systems may come at
hand, offering additional information from plants that are similar (yet not
equal) to the system one aims to control. Assuming that this supplementary
information is available, we propose a novel, direct design approach that
leverages the data from similar plants, the knowledge of controllers calibrated
on them, and the corresponding closed-loop performance to enhance
model-reference control design. More specifically, by constructing the new
controller as a combination of the available ones, our approach exploits all
the available priors following a meta-learning philosophy, while ensuring
non-decreasing performance. An extensive numerical analysis supports our
claims, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving
performance comparable to iterative approaches, while at the same time
retaining the efficiency of one-shot direct data-driven methods like VRFT.

<p class="mathjax">Textual style transfer is the task of transforming stylistic properties of
text while preserving meaning. Target "styles" can be defined in numerous ways,
ranging from single attributes (e.g, formality) to authorship (e.g,
Shakespeare). Previous unsupervised style-transfer approaches generally rely on
significant amounts of labeled data for only a fixed set of styles or require
large language models. In contrast, we introduce a novel diffusion-based
framework for general-purpose style transfer that can be flexibly adapted to
arbitrary target styles at inference time. Our parameter-efficient approach,
ParaGuide, leverages paraphrase-conditioned diffusion models alongside
gradient-based guidance from both off-the-shelf classifiers and strong existing
style embedders to transform the style of text while preserving semantic
information. We validate the method on the Enron Email Corpus, with both human
and automatic evaluations, and find that it outperforms strong baselines on
formality, sentiment, and even authorship style transfer.

<p class="mathjax">Factored feature volumes offer a simple way to build more compact, efficient,
and intepretable neural fields, but also introduce biases that are not
necessarily beneficial for real-world data. In this work, we (1) characterize
the undesirable biases that these architectures have for axis-aligned signals
-- they can lead to radiance field reconstruction differences of as high as 2
PSNR -- and (2) explore how learning a set of canonicalizing transformations
can improve representations by removing these biases. We prove in a
two-dimensional model problem that simultaneously learning these
transformations together with scene appearance succeeds with drastically
improved efficiency. We validate the resulting architectures, which we call
TILTED, using image, signed distance, and radiance field reconstruction tasks,
where we observe improvements across quality, robustness, compactness, and
runtime. Results demonstrate that TILTED can enable capabilities comparable to
baselines that are 2x larger, while highlighting weaknesses of neural field
evaluation procedures.

<p class="mathjax">Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs,
frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based
system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition
mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of
high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural
network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show
the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost
function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the
overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an
additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities
of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current
frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train
a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame
as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain
therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in
common video acquisition settings. Our demo video can be found at

<p class="mathjax">Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in traffic forecasting. However, they often struggle to forecast
congestion accurately due to the limitations of traditional loss functions.
While accurate forecasting of regular traffic conditions is crucial, a reliable
AI system must also accurately forecast congestion scenarios to maintain safe
and efficient transportation. In this paper, we explore various loss functions
inspired by heavy tail analysis and imbalanced classification problems to
address this issue. We evaluate the efficacy of these loss functions in
forecasting traffic speed, with an emphasis on congestion scenarios. Through
extensive experiments on real-world traffic datasets, we discovered that when
optimizing for Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the MAE-Focal Loss function stands
out as the most effective. When optimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE), Gumbel
Loss proves to be the superior choice. These choices effectively forecast
traffic congestion events without compromising the accuracy of regular traffic
speed forecasts. This research enhances deep learning models' capabilities in
forecasting sudden speed changes due to congestion and underscores the need for
more research in this direction. By elevating the accuracy of congestion
forecasting, we advocate for AI systems that are reliable, secure, and
resilient in practical traffic management scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">As the development of formal proofs is a time-consuming task, it is important
to devise ways of sharing the already written proofs to prevent wasting time
redoing them. One of the challenges in this domain is to translate proofs
written in proof assistants based on impredicative logics to proof assistants
based on predicative logics, whenever impredicativity is not used in an
essential way.
<br />In this paper we present a transformation for sharing proofs with a core
predicative system supporting prenex universe polymorphism (like in Agda). It
consists in trying to elaborate a potentially impredicative term into a
predicative universe polymorphic term as general as possible. The use of
universe polymorphism is justified by the fact that mapping each universe to a
fixed one in the target theory is not sufficient in most cases. During the
algorithm, we need to solve unification problems in the equational theory of
universe levels. In order to do this, we give a complete characterization of
when a single equation admits a most general unifier. This characterization is
then employed in an algorithm which uses a constraint-postponement strategy to
solve unification problems.
<br />The proposed translation is of course partial, but in practice allows one to
translate many proofs that do not use impredicativity in an essential way.
Indeed, it was implemented in the tool Predicativize and then used to translate
semi-automatically many non-trivial developments from Matita's arithmetic
library to Agda, including proofs of Bertrand's Postulate and Fermat's Little
Theorem, which (as far as we know) were not available in Agda yet.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding generalization in deep neural networks is an active area of
research. A promising avenue of exploration has been that of margin
measurements: the shortest distance to the decision boundary for a given sample
or its representation internal to the network. While margins have been shown to
be correlated with the generalization ability of a model when measured at its
hidden representations (hidden margins), no such link between large margins and
generalization has been established for input margins. We show that while input
margins are not generally predictive of generalization, they can be if the
search space is appropriately constrained. We develop such a measure based on
input margins, which we refer to as `constrained margins'. The predictive power
of this new measure is demonstrated on the 'Predicting Generalization in Deep
Learning' (PGDL) dataset and contrasted with hidden representation margins. We
find that constrained margins achieve highly competitive scores and outperform
other margin measurements in general. This provides a novel insight on the
relationship between generalization and classification margins, and highlights
the importance of considering the data manifold for investigations of
generalization in DNNs.

<p class="mathjax">Alongside neuroimaging such as MRI scans and PET, Alzheimer's disease (AD)
datasets contain valuable tabular data including AD biomarkers and clinical
assessments. Existing computer vision approaches struggle to utilize this
additional information. To address these needs, we propose a generalizable
framework for multimodal contrastive learning of image data and tabular data, a
novel tabular attention module for amplifying and ranking salient features in
tables, and the application of these techniques onto Alzheimer's disease
prediction. Experimental evaulations demonstrate the strength of our framework
by detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) from over 882 MR image slices from the
ADNI database. We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data
and our novel tabular attention approach and through attribution of the
attention scores for each row of the table, we note and rank the most
predominant features. Results show that the model is capable of an accuracy of
over 83.8%, almost a 10% increase from previous state of the art.

<p class="mathjax">We enable reinforcement learning agents to learn successful behavior policies
by utilizing relevant pre-existing teacher policies. The teacher policies are
introduced as objectives, in addition to the task objective, in a
multi-objective policy optimization setting. Using the Multi-Objective Maximum
a Posteriori Policy Optimization algorithm
\citep{abdolmaleki2020distributional}, we show that teacher policies can help
speed up learning, particularly in the absence of shaping rewards. In two
domains with continuous observation and action spaces, our agents successfully
compose teacher policies in sequence and in parallel, and are also able to
further extend the policies of the teachers in order to solve the task.
<br />Depending on the specified combination of task and teacher(s), teacher(s) may
naturally act to limit the final performance of an agent. The extent to which
agents are required to adhere to teacher policies are determined by
hyperparameters which determine both the effect of teachers on learning speed
and the eventual performance of the agent on the task. In the {\tt humanoid}
domain \citep{deepmindcontrolsuite2018}, we also equip agents with the ability
to control the selection of teachers. With this ability, agents are able to
meaningfully compose from the teacher policies to achieve a superior task
reward on the {\tt walk} task than in cases without access to the teacher
policies. We show the resemblance of composed task policies with the
corresponding teacher policies through videos.

<p class="mathjax">The success of style-based generators largely benefits from style modulation,
which helps take care of the cross-instance variation within data. However, the
instance-wise stochasticity is typically introduced via regular convolution,
where kernels interact with features at some fixed locations, limiting its
capacity for modeling geometric variation. To alleviate this problem, we equip
the generator in generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a plug-and-play
module, termed as modulated transformation module (MTM). This module predicts
spatial offsets under the control of latent codes, based on which the
convolution operation can be applied at variable locations for different
instances, and hence offers the model an additional degree of freedom to handle
geometry deformation. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can be
faithfully generalized to various generative tasks, including image generation,
3D-aware image synthesis, and video generation, and get compatible with
state-of-the-art frameworks without any hyper-parameter tuning. It is
noteworthy that, towards human generation on the challenging TaiChi dataset, we
improve the FID of StyleGAN3 from 21.36 to 13.60, demonstrating the efficacy of
learning modulated geometry transformation.

<p class="mathjax">Graphs are fundamental objects that find widespread applications across
computer science and beyond. Graph Theory has yielded deep insights about
structural properties of various families of graphs, which are leveraged in the
design and analysis of algorithms for graph optimization problems and other
computational optimization problems. These insights have also proved helpful in
understanding the limits of efficient computation by providing constructions of
hard problem instances. At the same time, algorithmic tools and techniques
provide a fresh perspective on graph theoretic problems, often leading to novel
discoveries. In this thesis, we exploit this symbiotic relationship between
graph theory and algorithms for graph optimization problems and beyond. This
thesis consists of three parts.
<br />In the first part, we study a graph routing problem called the Node-Disjoint
Paths (NDP) problem. Given a graph and a set of source-destination pairs of its
vertices, the goal is to route the maximum number of pairs via node-disjoint
paths. We come close to resolving the approximability of NDP by showing that it
is $n^{\Omega(1/poly\log\log n)}$-hard to approximate, even on grid graphs,
where n is the number of vertices. In the second part of this thesis, we use
graph decomposition techniques developed for efficient algorithms to derive a
graph theoretic result. We show that for every n-vertex expander graph G, if H
is any graph with at most $O(n/\log n)$ vertices and edges, then H is a minor
of G. In the last part, we show that the graph theoretic tools and graph
algorithmic techniques can shed light on problems seemingly unrelated to
graphs. We show that the randomized space complexity of the Longest Increasing
Subsequence (LIS) problem in the streaming model is intrinsically tied to the
query-complexity of the Non-Crossing Matching problem on graphs in a new model
of computation that we define.

<p class="mathjax">Tissue phenotyping is a fundamental computational pathology (CPath) task in
learning objective characterizations of histopathologic biomarkers in anatomic
pathology. However, whole-slide imaging (WSI) poses a complex computer vision
problem in which the large-scale image resolutions of WSIs and the enormous
diversity of morphological phenotypes preclude large-scale data annotation.
Current efforts have proposed using pretrained image encoders with either
transfer learning from natural image datasets or self-supervised pretraining on
publicly-available histopathology datasets, but have not been extensively
developed and evaluated across diverse tissue types at scale. We introduce UNI,
a general-purpose self-supervised model for pathology, pretrained using over
100 million tissue patches from over 100,000 diagnostic haematoxylin and
eosin-stained WSIs across 20 major tissue types, and evaluated on 33
representative CPath clinical tasks in CPath of varying diagnostic
difficulties. In addition to outperforming previous state-of-the-art models, we
demonstrate new modeling capabilities in CPath such as resolution-agnostic
tissue classification, slide classification using few-shot class prototypes,
and disease subtyping generalization in classifying up to 108 cancer types in
the OncoTree code classification system. UNI advances unsupervised
representation learning at scale in CPath in terms of both pretraining data and
downstream evaluation, enabling data-efficient AI models that can generalize
and transfer to a gamut of diagnostically-challenging tasks and clinical
workflows in anatomic pathology.

<p class="mathjax">In order to better understand feature learning in neural networks, we propose
a framework for understanding linear models in tangent feature space where the
features are allowed to be transformed during training. We consider linear
transformations of features, resulting in a joint optimization over parameters
and transformations with a bilinear interpolation constraint. We show that this
optimization problem has an equivalent linearly constrained optimization with
structured regularization that encourages approximately low rank solutions.
Specializing to neural network structure, we gain insights into how the
features and thus the kernel function change, providing additional nuance to
the phenomenon of kernel alignment when the target function is poorly
represented using tangent features. In addition to verifying our theoretical
observations in real neural networks on a simple regression problem, we
empirically show that an adaptive feature implementation of tangent feature
classification has an order of magnitude lower sample complexity than the fixed
tangent feature model on MNIST and CIFAR-10.

<p class="mathjax">Since real-world training datasets cannot properly sample the long tail of
the underlying data distribution, corner cases and rare out-of-domain samples
can severely hinder the performance of state-of-the-art models. This problem
becomes even more severe for dense tasks, such as 3D semantic segmentation,
where points of non-standard objects can be confidently associated to the wrong
class. In this work, we focus on improving the generalization to out-of-domain
data. We achieve this by augmenting the training set with adversarial examples.
First, we learn a set of vectors that deform the objects in an adversarial
fashion. To prevent the adversarial examples from being too far from the
existing data distribution, we preserve their plausibility through a series of
constraints, ensuring sensor-awareness and shapes smoothness. Then, we perform
adversarial augmentation by applying the learned sample-independent vectors to
the available objects when training a model. We conduct extensive experiments
across a variety of scenarios on data from KITTI, Waymo, and CrashD for 3D
object detection, and on data from SemanticKITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes for 3D
semantic segmentation. Despite training on a standard single dataset, our
approach substantially improves the robustness and generalization of both 3D
object detection and 3D semantic segmentation methods to out-of-domain data.

<p class="mathjax">Network science provides very powerful tools for extracting information from
interacting data. Although recently the unsupervised detection of phases of
matter using machine learning has raised significant interest, the full
prediction power of network science has not yet been systematically explored in
this context. Here we fill this gap by providing an in-depth statistical,
combinatorial, geometrical and topological characterization of 2D Ising
snapshot networks (IsingNets) extracted from Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D
Ising model at different temperatures, going across the phase transition. Our
analysis reveals the complex organization properties of IsingNets in both the
ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and demonstrates the significant
deviations of the IsingNets with respect to randomized null models. In
particular percolation properties of the IsingNets reflect the existence of the
symmetry between configurations with opposite magnetization below the critical
temperature and the very compact nature of the two emerging giant clusters
revealed by our persistent homology analysis of the IsingNets. Moreover, the
IsingNets display a very broad degree distribution and significant
degree-degree correlations and weight-degree correlations demonstrating that
they encode relevant information present in the configuration space of the 2D
Ising model. The geometrical organization of the critical IsingNets is
reflected in their spectral properties deviating from the one of the null
model. This work reveals the important insights that network science can bring
to the characterization of phases of matter. The set of tools described hereby
can be applied as well to numerical and experimental data.

<p class="mathjax">Current quantum computers suffer from non-stationary noise channels with high
error rates, which undermines their reliability and reproducibility. We propose
a Bayesian inference-based adaptive algorithm that can learn and mitigate
quantum noise in response to changing channel conditions. Our study emphasizes
the need for dynamic inference of critical channel parameters to improve
program accuracy. We use the Dirichlet distribution to model the stochasticity
of the Pauli channel. This allows us to perform Bayesian inference, which can
improve the performance of probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) under
time-varying noise. Our work demonstrates the importance of characterizing and
mitigating temporal variations in quantum noise, which is crucial for
developing more accurate and reliable quantum technologies. Our results show
that Bayesian PEC can outperform non-adaptive approaches by a factor of 4.5x
when measured using Hellinger distance from the ideal distribution.

<p class="mathjax">Recent works have shown the promise of learning pre-trained models for 3D
molecular representation. However, existing pre-training models focus
predominantly on equilibrium data and largely overlook off-equilibrium
conformations. It is challenging to extend these methods to off-equilibrium
data because their training objective relies on assumptions of conformations
being the local energy minima. We address this gap by proposing a force-centric
pretraining model for 3D molecular conformations covering both equilibrium and
off-equilibrium data. For off-equilibrium data, our model learns directly from
their atomic forces. For equilibrium data, we introduce zero-force
regularization and forced-based denoising techniques to approximate
near-equilibrium forces. We obtain a unified pre-trained model for 3D molecular
representation with over 15 million diverse conformations. Experiments show
that, with our pre-training objective, we increase forces accuracy by around 3
times compared to the un-pre-trained Equivariant Transformer model. By
incorporating regularizations on equilibrium data, we solved the problem of
unstable MD simulations in vanilla Equivariant Transformers, achieving
state-of-the-art simulation performance with 2.45 times faster inference time

<p class="mathjax">It is estimated that approximately 15% of cancers worldwide can be linked to
viral infections. The viruses that can cause or increase the risk of cancer
include human papillomavirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus,
and human immunodeficiency virus, to name a few. The computational analysis of
the massive amounts of tumor DNA data, whose collection is enabled by the
recent advancements in sequencing technologies, have allowed studies of the
potential association between cancers and viral pathogens. However, the high
diversity of oncoviral families makes reliable detection of viral DNA difficult
and thus, renders such analysis challenging. In this paper, we introduce XVir,
a data pipeline that relies on a transformer-based deep learning architecture
to reliably identify viral DNA present in human tumors. In particular, XVir is
trained on genomic sequencing reads from viral and human genomes and may be
used with tumor sequence information to find evidence of viral DNA in human
cancers. Results on semi-experimental data demonstrate that XVir is capable of
achieving high detection accuracy, generally outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods while being more compact and less computationally demanding.

<p class="mathjax">\textit{Objective:} Conventional EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD)
is achieved by comparing the time-varying speech stimuli and the elicited EEG
signals. However, in order to obtain reliable correlation values, these methods
necessitate a long decision window, resulting in a long detection latency.
Humans have a remarkable ability to recognize and follow a known speaker,
regardless of the spoken content. In this paper, we seek to detect the attended
speaker among the pre-enrolled speakers from the elicited EEG signals. In this
manner, we avoid relying on the speech stimuli for AAD at run-time. In doing
so, we propose a novel EEG-based attended speaker detection (E-ASD) task.
\textit{Methods:} We encode a speaker's voice with a fixed dimensional vector,
known as speaker embedding, and project it to an audio-derived voice signature,
which characterizes the speaker's unique voice regardless of the spoken
content. We hypothesize that such a voice signature also exists in the
listener's brain that can be decoded from the elicited EEG signals, referred to
as EEG-derived voice signature. By comparing the audio-derived voice signature
and the EEG-derived voice signature, we are able to effectively detect the
attended speaker in the listening brain. \textit{Results:} Experiments show
that E-ASD can effectively detect the attended speaker from the 0.5s EEG
decision windows, achieving 99.78\% AAD accuracy, 99.94\% AUC, and 0.27\% EER.
\textit{Conclusion:} We conclude that it is possible to derive the attended
speaker's voice signature from the EEG signals so as to detect the attended
speaker in a listening brain. \textit{Significance:} We present the first proof
of concept for detecting the attended speaker from the elicited EEG signals in
a cocktail party environment. The successful implementation of E-ASD marks a
non-trivial, but crucial step towards smart hearing aids.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combines microscopy and spectroscopy to assess
the spatial distribution of spectroscopically active compounds in objects, and
has diverse applications in food quality control, pharmaceutical processes, and
waste sorting. However, due to the large size of HSI datasets, it can be
challenging to analyze and store them within a reasonable digital
infrastructure, especially in waste sorting where speed and data storage
resources are limited. Additionally, as with most spectroscopic data, there is
significant redundancy, making pixel and variable selection crucial for
retaining chemical information. Recent high-tech developments in chemometrics
enable automated and evidence-based data reduction, which can substantially
enhance the speed and performance of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a
widely used algorithm for chemical resolution of HSI data. By recovering the
pure contribution maps and spectral profiles of distributed compounds, NMF can
provide evidence-based sorting decisions for efficient waste management. To
improve the quality and efficiency of data analysis on hyperspectral imaging
(HSI) data, we apply a convex-hull method to select essential pixels and
wavelengths and remove uninformative and redundant information. This process
minimizes computational strain and effectively eliminates highly mixed pixels.
By reducing data redundancy, data investigation and analysis become more
straightforward, as demonstrated in both simulated and real HSI data for
plastic sorting.

<p class="mathjax">The optimal number of clusters is one of the main concerns when applying
cluster analysis. Several cluster validity indexes have been introduced to
address this problem. However, in some situations, there is more than one
option that can be chosen as the final number of clusters. This aspect has been
overlooked by most of the existing works in this area. In this study, we
introduce a correlation-based fuzzy cluster validity index known as the
Wiroonsri-Preedasawakul (WP) index. This index is defined based on the
correlation between the actual distance between a pair of data points and the
distance between adjusted centroids with respect to that pair. We evaluate and
compare the performance of our index with several existing indexes, including
Xie-Beni, Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik, Tang, Wu-Li, generalized C, and Kwon2.
We conduct this evaluation on four types of datasets: artificial datasets,
real-world datasets, simulated datasets with ranks, and image datasets, using
the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Overall, the WP index outperforms most, if not
all, of these indexes in terms of accurately detecting the optimal number of
clusters and providing accurate secondary options. Moreover, our index remains
effective even when the fuzziness parameter $m$ is set to a large value. Our R
package called WPfuzzyCVIs used in this work is also available in
https://github.com/nwiroonsri/WPfuzzyCVIs.

neural-network architectures called neural operators to approximate maps
between function spaces. Motivated by a prospect of employing them in
fundamental physics, we examine applications to scattering processes in quantum
mechanics. We use an iterated variant of Fourier neural operators to learn the
physics of Schr\"odinger operators, which map from the space of initial wave
functions and potentials to the final wave functions. These deep operator
learning ideas are put to test in two concrete problems: a neural operator
predicting the time evolution of a wave packet scattering off a central
potential in $1+1$ dimensions, and the double-slit experiment in $2+1$
dimensions. At inference, neural operators can become orders of magnitude more
efficient compared to traditional finite-difference solvers.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, speech-based self-supervised learning (SSL) has made
significant progress in various tasks, including automatic speech recognition
(ASR). An ASR model with decent performance can be realized by fine-tuning an
SSL model with a small fraction of labeled data. Reducing the demand for
labeled data is always of great practical value. In this paper, we further
extend the use of SSL to cut down labeling costs with active learning. Three
types of units on different granularities are derived from speech signals in an
unsupervised way, and their effects are compared by applying a contrastive data
selection method. The experimental results show that our proposed data
selection framework can effectively improve the word error rate (WER) by more
than 11% with the same amount of labeled data, or halve the labeling cost while
maintaining the same WER, compared to random selection.

<p class="mathjax">Matbench Discovery simulates the deployment of machine learning (ML) energy
models in a high-throughput search for stable inorganic crystals. We address
the disconnect between (i) thermodynamic stability and formation energy and
(ii) in-domain vs out-of-distribution performance. Alongside this paper, we
publish a Python package to aid with future model submissions and a growing
online leaderboard with further insights into trade-offs between various
performance metrics. To answer the question which ML methodology performs best
at materials discovery, our initial release explores a variety of models
including random forests, graph neural networks (GNN), one-shot predictors,
iterative Bayesian optimizers and universal interatomic potentials (UIP).
Ranked best-to-worst by their test set F1 score on thermodynamic stability
prediction, we find CHGNet &gt; M3GNet &gt; MACE &gt; ALIGNN &gt; MEGNet &gt; CGCNN &gt; CGCNN+P
&gt; Wrenformer &gt; BOWSR &gt; Voronoi tessellation fingerprints with random forest.
The top 3 models are UIPs, the winning methodology for ML-guided materials
discovery, achieving F1 scores of ~0.6 for crystal stability classification and
discovery acceleration factors (DAF) of up to 5x on the first 10k most stable
predictions compared to dummy selection from our test set. We also highlight a
sharp disconnect between commonly used global regression metrics and more
task-relevant classification metrics. Accurate regressors are susceptible to
unexpectedly high false-positive rates if those accurate predictions lie close
to the decision boundary at 0 eV/atom above the convex hull where most
materials are. Our results highlight the need to focus on classification
metrics that actually correlate with improved stability hit rate.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the remarkable advances in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and
management that have occurred over the past decade, malignant tumors remain a
major public health problem. Further progress in combating cancer may be
enabled by personalizing the delivery of therapies according to the predicted
response for each individual patient. The design of personalized therapies
requires patient-specific information integrated into an appropriate
mathematical model of tumor response. A fundamental barrier to realizing this
paradigm is the current lack of a rigorous, yet practical, mathematical theory
of tumor initiation, development, invasion, and response to therapy. In this
review, we begin by providing an overview of different approaches to modeling
tumor growth and treatment, including mechanistic as well as data-driven models
based on ``big data" and artificial intelligence. Next, we present illustrative
examples of mathematical models manifesting their utility and discussing the
limitations of stand-alone mechanistic and data-driven models. We further
discuss the potential of mechanistic models for not only predicting, but also
optimizing response to therapy on a patient-specific basis. We then discuss
current efforts and future possibilities to integrate mechanistic and
data-driven models. We conclude by proposing five fundamental challenges that
must be addressed to fully realize personalized care for cancer patients driven
by computational models.

<p class="mathjax">Given their potential to demonstrate near-term quantum advantage, variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been extensively studied. Although numerous
techniques have been developed for VQA parameter optimization, it remains a
significant challenge. A practical issue is the high sensitivity of quantum
noise to environmental changes, and its propensity to shift in real time. This
presents a critical problem as an optimized VQA ansatz may not perform
effectively under a different noise environment. For the first time, we explore
how to optimize VQA parameters to be robust against unknown shifted noise. We
model the noise level as a random variable with an unknown probability density
function (PDF), and we assume that the PDF may shift within an uncertainty set.
This assumption guides us to formulate a distributionally robust optimization
problem, with the goal of finding parameters that maintain effectiveness under
shifted noise. We utilize a distributionally robust Bayesian optimization
solver for our proposed formulation. This provides numerical evidence in both
the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational
Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with hardware-efficient ansatz, indicating that we
can identify parameters that perform more robustly under shifted noise. We
regard this work as the first step towards improving the reliability of VQAs
influenced by real-time noise.

<p class="mathjax">Asymptotic separation index is a parameter that measures how easily a Borel
graph can be approximated by its subgraphs with finite components. In contrast
to the more classical notion of hyperfiniteness, asymptotic separation index is
well-suited for combinatorial applications in the Borel setting. The main
result of this paper is a Borel version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma -- a
powerful general-purpose tool in probabilistic combinatorics -- under a finite
asymptotic separation index assumption. As a consequence, we show that locally
checkable labeling problems that are solvable by efficient randomized
distributed algorithms admit Borel solutions on bounded degree Borel graphs
with finite asymptotic separation index. From this we derive a number of
corollaries, for example a Borel version of Brooks's theorem for graphs with
finite asymptotic separation index.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of sampling from a distribution governed by a
potential function. This work proposes an explicit score-based MCMC method that
is deterministic, resulting in a deterministic evolution for particles rather
than a stochastic differential equation evolution. The score term is given in
closed form by a regularized Wasserstein proximal, using a kernel convolution
that is approximated by sampling. We demonstrate fast convergence on various
problems and show improved dimensional dependence of mixing time bounds for the
case of Gaussian distributions compared to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm
(ULA) and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA). We additionally
derive closed form expressions for the distributions at each iterate for
quadratic potential functions, characterizing the variance reduction. Empirical
results demonstrate that the particles behave in an organized manner, lying on
level set contours of the potential. Moreover, the posterior mean estimator of
the proposed method is shown to be closer to the maximum a-posteriori estimator
compared to ULA and MALA, in the context of Bayesian logistic regression.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) is becoming a critical tool for interrogation of large
complex data. Labeling, defined as the process of adding meaningful
annotations, is a crucial step of supervised ML. However, labeling datasets is
time consuming. Here we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained
on crudely labeled astronomical videos, can be leveraged to improve the quality
of data labeling and reduce the need for human intervention. We use videos of
the solar magnetic field, crudely labeled into two classes: emergence or
non-emergence of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), based on their first
detection on the solar disk. We train CNNs using crude labels, manually verify,
correct labeling vs. CNN disagreements, and repeat this process until
convergence. Traditionally, flux emergence labelling is done manually. We find
that a high-quality labeled dataset, derived through this iterative process,
reduces the necessary manual verification by 50%. Furthermore, by gradually
masking the videos and looking for maximum change in CNN inference, we locate
BMR emergence time without retraining the CNN. This demonstrates the
versatility of CNNs for simplifying the challenging task of labeling complex
dynamic events.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum variational circuits have gained significant attention due to their
applications in the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and quantum
machine learning research. This work introduces a novel class of classical
probabilistic circuits designed for generating approximate solutions to
combinatorial optimization problems constructed using two-bit stochastic
matrices. Through a numerical study, we investigate the performance of our
proposed variational circuits in solving the Max-Cut problem on various graphs
of increasing sizes. Our classical algorithm demonstrates improved performance
for several graph types to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Our
findings suggest that evaluating the performance of quantum variational
circuits against variational circuits with sub-universal gate sets is a
valuable benchmark for identifying areas where quantum variational circuits can
excel.

<p class="mathjax">Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) are composed of successive
transmissive layers optimized using supervised deep learning to all-optically
implement various computational tasks between an input and output field-of-view
(FOV). Here, we present a pyramid-structured diffractive optical network design
(which we term P-D2NN), optimized specifically for unidirectional image
magnification and demagnification. In this P-D2NN design, the diffractive
layers are pyramidally scaled in alignment with the direction of the image
magnification or demagnification. Our analyses revealed the efficacy of this
P-D2NN design in unidirectional image magnification and demagnification tasks,
producing high-fidelity magnified or demagnified images in only one direction,
while inhibiting the image formation in the opposite direction - confirming the
desired unidirectional imaging operation. Compared to the conventional D2NN
designs with uniform-sized successive diffractive layers, P-D2NN design
achieves similar performance in unidirectional magnification tasks using only
half of the diffractive degrees of freedom within the optical processor volume.
Furthermore, it maintains its unidirectional image
magnification/demagnification functionality across a large band of illumination
wavelengths despite being trained with a single illumination wavelength. With
this pyramidal architecture, we also designed a wavelength-multiplexed
diffractive network, where a unidirectional magnifier and a unidirectional
demagnifier operate simultaneously in opposite directions, at two distinct
illumination wavelengths. The efficacy of the P-D2NN architecture was also
validated experimentally using monochromatic terahertz illumination,
successfully matching our numerical simulations. P-D2NN offers a
physics-inspired strategy for designing task-specific visual processors.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper the authors propose a polynomial algorithm which allows the
computation of the farthest in an intersection of balls to a given point under
three additional hypothesis: the farthest is unique, the distance to it is
known and its magnitude is known. As a use case the authors analyze the subset
sum problem SSP(S,T) for a given $S\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $T \in \mathbb{R}$.
The proposed approach is to write the SSP as a distance maximization over an
intersection of balls. It was shown that the SSP has a solution if and only if
the maximum value of the distance has a predefined value. This together with
the fact that a solution is a corner of the unit hypercube, allows the authors
to apply the proposed geometry results to find a solution to the SSP under the
hypothesis that is unique.

<p class="mathjax">By a semi-Lagrangian change of coordinates, the hydrostatic Euler equations
describing free-surface sheared flows is rewritten as a system of quasilinear
equations, where stability conditions can be determined by the analysis of its
hyperbolic structure. This new system can be written as a quasi linear system
in time and horizontal variables and involves no more vertical derivatives.
However, the coefficients in front of the horizontal derivatives include an
integral operator acting on the new vertical variable. The spectrum of these
operators is studied in detail, in particular it includes a continuous part.
Riemann invariants are then determined as conserved quantities along the
characteristic curves. Examples of solutions are provided, in particular
stationary solutions and solutions blowing-up in finite time. Eventually, we
propose an exact multi-layer $\mathbb{P}_0$-discretization, which could be used
to solve numerically this semi-Lagrangian system, and analyze the eigenvalues
of the corresponding discretized operator to investigate the hyperbolic nature
of the approximated system.

<p class="mathjax">Most of the intracranial aneurysms (ICA) occur on a specific portion of the
cerebral vascular tree named the Circle of Willis (CoW). More particularly,
they mainly arise onto fifteen of the major arterial bifurcations constituting
this circular structure. Hence, for an efficient and timely diagnosis it is
critical to develop some methods being able to accurately recognize each
Bifurcation of Interest (BoI). Indeed, an automatic extraction of the
bifurcations presenting the higher risk of developing an ICA would offer the
neuroradiologists a quick glance at the most alarming areas. Due to the recent
efforts on Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning turned out to be the best
performing technology for many pattern recognition tasks. Moreover, various
methods have been particularly designed for medical image analysis purposes.
This study intends to assist the neuroradiologists to promptly locate any
bifurcation presenting a high risk of ICA occurrence. It can be seen as a
Computer Aided Diagnosis scheme, where the Artificial Intelligence facilitates
the access to the regions of interest within the MRI. In this work, we propose
a method for a fully automatic detection and recognition of the bifurcations of
interest forming the Circle of Willis. Several neural networks architectures
have been tested, and we thoroughly evaluate the bifurcation recognition rate.

<p class="mathjax">Quantifying uncertainty of predictions has been identified as one way to
develop more trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) models beyond
conventional reporting of performance metrics. When considering their role in a
clinical decision support setting, AI classification models should ideally
avoid confident wrong predictions and maximise the confidence of correct
predictions. Models that do this are said to be well-calibrated with regard to
confidence. However, relatively little attention has been paid to how to
improve calibration when training these models, i.e., to make the training
strategy uncertainty-aware. In this work we evaluate three novel
uncertainty-aware training strategies comparing against two state-of-the-art
approaches. We analyse performance on two different clinical applications:
cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) response prediction and coronary artery
disease (CAD) diagnosis from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The
best-performing model in terms of both classification accuracy and the most
common calibration measure, expected calibration error (ECE) was the Confidence
Weight method, a novel approach that weights the loss of samples to explicitly
penalise confident incorrect predictions. The method reduced the ECE by 17% for
CRT response prediction and by 22% for CAD diagnosis when compared to a
baseline classifier in which no uncertainty-aware strategy was included. In
both applications, as well as reducing the ECE there was a slight increase in
accuracy from 69% to 70% and 70% to 72% for CRT response prediction and CAD
diagnosis respectively. However, our analysis showed a lack of consistency in
terms of optimal models when using different calibration measures. This
indicates the need for careful consideration of performance metrics when
training and selecting models for complex high-risk applications in healthcare.

<p class="mathjax">The limited memory steepest descent method (Fletcher, 2012) for unconstrained
optimization problems stores a few past gradients to compute multiple stepsizes
at once. We review this method and propose new variants. For strictly convex
quadratic objective functions, we study the numerical behavior of different
techniques to compute new stepsizes. In particular, we introduce a method to
improve the use of harmonic Ritz values. We also show the existence of a secant
condition associated with LMSD, where the approximating Hessian is projected
onto a low-dimensional space. In the general nonlinear case, we propose two new
alternatives to Fletcher's method: first, the addition of symmetry constraints
to the secant condition valid for the quadratic case; second, a perturbation of
the last differences between consecutive gradients, to satisfy multiple secant
equations simultaneously. We show that Fletcher's method can also be
interpreted from this viewpoint.

<p class="mathjax">While deep learning techniques have provided the state-of-the-art performance
in various clinical tasks, explainability regarding their decision-making
process can greatly enhance the credence of these methods for safer and quicker
clinical adoption. With high flexibility, Gradient-weighted Class Activation
Mapping (Grad-CAM) has been widely adopted to offer intuitive visual
interpretation of various deep learning models' reasoning processes in
computer-assisted diagnosis. However, despite the popularity of the technique,
there is still a lack of systematic study on Grad-CAM's performance on
different deep learning architectures. In this study, we investigate its
robustness and effectiveness across different popular deep learning models,
with a focus on the impact of the networks' depths and architecture types, by
using a case study of automatic pneumothorax diagnosis in X-ray scans. Our
results show that deeper neural networks do not necessarily contribute to a
strong improvement of pneumothorax diagnosis accuracy, and the effectiveness of
GradCAM also varies among different network architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscientists and behavioral economists
have recognized the value of describing the process of decision making in
detail and modeling the emergence of decisions over time. For example, the time
it takes to decide can reveal more about an agents true hidden preferences than
only the decision itself. Similarly, data that track the ongoing decision
process such as eye movements or neural recordings contain critical information
that can be exploited, even if no decision is made. Here, we argue that
artificial intelligence (AI) research would benefit from a stronger focus on
insights about how decisions emerge over time and incorporate related process
data to improve AI predictions in general and human-AI interactions in
particular. First, we introduce a highly established computational framework
that assumes decisions to emerge from the noisy accumulation of evidence, and
we present related empirical work in psychology, neuroscience, and economics.
Next, we discuss to what extent current approaches in multi-agent AI do or do
not incorporate process data and models of decision making. Finally, we outline
how a more principled inclusion of the evidence-accumulation framework into the
training and use of AI can help to improve human-AI interactions in the future.

<p class="mathjax">For an arbitrary finite family of graphs, the distance labeling problem asks
to assign labels to all nodes of every graph in the family in a way that allows
one to recover the distance between any two nodes of any graph from their
labels. The main goal is to minimize the number of unique labels used. We study
this problem for the families $\mathcal{C}_n$ consisting of cycles of all
lengths between 3 and $n$. We observe that the exact solution for directed
cycles is straightforward and focus on the undirected case. We design a
labeling scheme requiring $\frac{n\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{6}}+O(n)$ labels, which is
almost twice less than is required by the earlier known scheme. Using the
computer search, we find an optimal labeling for each $n\le 17$, showing that
our scheme gives the results that are very close to the optimum.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of this work is to reconstruct high quality speech from lip motions
alone, a task also known as lip-to-speech. A key challenge of lip-to-speech
systems is the one-to-many mapping caused by (1) the existence of homophenes
and (2) multiple speech variations, resulting in a mispronounced and
over-smoothed speech. In this paper, we propose a novel lip-to-speech system
that significantly improves the generation quality by alleviating the
one-to-many mapping problem from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we
incorporate (1) self-supervised speech representations to disambiguate
homophenes, and (2) acoustic variance information to model diverse speech
styles. Additionally, to better solve the aforementioned problem, we employ a
flow based post-net which captures and refines the details of the generated
speech. We perform extensive experiments and demonstrate that our method
achieves the generation quality close to that of real human utterance,
outperforming existing methods in terms of speech naturalness and
intelligibility by a large margin. Synthesised samples are available at the

numbers. A classical result in this area shows that dependent type theory
without any universes is conservative over Heyting Arithmetic (HA). We build on
this result by showing that type theories with one level of universes are
conservative over Higher-order Heyting Arithmetic (HAH). Although this clearly
depends on the specific type theory, we show that the interpretation of logic
also plays a major role. For proof-irrelevant interpretations, we will see that
strong versions of type theory prove exactly the same higher-order arithmetical
formulas as HAH. Conversely, proof-relevant interpretations prove strictly more
second-order arithmetical formulas than HAH, however they still prove exactly
the same first-order arithmetical formulas. Along the way, we investigate the
different interpretations of logic in type theory, and to what extent dependent
type theories can be seen as extensions of higher-order logic. We apply our
results by proving De Jongh's theorem for type theory.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has emerged as the preferred modeling approach for automatic
ECG analysis. In this study, we investigate three elements aimed at improving
the quantitative accuracy of such systems. These components consistently
enhance performance beyond the existing state-of-the-art, which is
predominantly based on convolutional models. Firstly, we explore more
expressive architectures by exploiting structured state space models (SSMs).
These models have shown promise in capturing long-term dependencies in time
series data. By incorporating SSMs into our approach, we not only achieve
better performance, but also gain insights into long-standing questions in the
field. Specifically, for standard diagnostic tasks, we find no advantage in
using higher sampling rates such as 500Hz compared to 100Hz. Similarly,
extending the input size of the model beyond 3 seconds does not lead to
significant improvements. Secondly, we demonstrate that self-supervised
learning using contrastive predictive coding can further improve the
performance of SSMs. By leveraging self-supervision, we enable the model to
learn more robust and representative features, leading to improved analysis
accuracy. Lastly, we depart from synthetic benchmarking scenarios and
incorporate basic demographic metadata alongside the ECG signal as input. This
inclusion of patient metadata departs from the conventional practice of relying
solely on the signal itself. Remarkably, this addition consistently yields
positive effects on predictive performance. We firmly believe that all three
components should be considered when developing next-generation ECG analysis
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">There has been growing interest in high-order tensor methods for nonconvex
optimization, with adaptive regularization, as they possess better/optimal
worst-case evaluation complexity globally and faster convergence
asymptotically. These algorithms crucially rely on repeatedly minimizing
nonconvex multivariate Taylor-based polynomial sub-problems, at least locally.
Finding efficient techniques for the solution of these sub-problems, beyond the
second-order case, has been an open question. This paper proposes a
second-order method, Quadratic Quartic Regularisation (QQR), for efficiently
minimizing nonconvex quartically-regularized cubic polynomials, such as the
AR$p$ sub-problem [3] with $p=3$. Inspired by [35], QQR approximates the
third-order tensor term by a linear combination of quadratic and quartic terms,
yielding (possibly nonconvex) local models that are solvable to global
optimality. In order to achieve accuracy $\epsilon$ in the first-order
criticality of the sub-problem, we show that the error in the QQR method
decreases either linearly or by at least $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{4/3})$ for
locally convex iterations, while in the sufficiently nonconvex case, by at
least $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$; thus improving, on these types of iterations,
the general cubic-regularization bound. Preliminary numerical experiments
indicate that two QQR variants perform competitively with state-of-the-art
approaches such as ARC (also known as AR$p$ with $p=2$), achieving either a
lower objective value or iteration counts.

<p class="mathjax">The collective behavior of swarms is extremely difficult to estimate or
predict, even when the local agent rules are known and simple. The presented
work seeks to leverage the similarities between fluids and swarm systems to
generate a thermodynamics-inspired characterization of the collective behavior
of robotic swarms. While prior works have borrowed tools from fluid dynamics to
design swarming behaviors, they have usually avoided the task of generating a
fluids-inspired macroscopic state (or macrostate) description of the swarm.
This work will bridge the gap by seeking to answer the following question: is
it possible to generate a small set of thermodynamics-inspired macroscopic
properties that may later be used to quantify all possible collective behaviors
of swarm systems? In this paper, we present three macroscopic properties
analogous to pressure, temperature, and density of a gas, to describe the
behavior of a swarm that is governed by only attractive and repulsive agent
interactions. These properties are made to satisfy an equation similar to the
ideal gas law, and also generalized to satisfy the virial equation of state for
real gases. Finally, we investigate how swarm specifications such as density
and average agent velocity affect the system macrostate.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the widespread utilization of Gaussian process models for versatile
nonparametric modeling, they exhibit limitations in effectively capturing
abrupt changes in function smoothness and accommodating relationships with
heteroscedastic errors. Addressing these shortcomings, the heteroscedastic
Gaussian process (HeGP) regression seeks to introduce flexibility by
acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the
regression model. In this work, we extend the HeGP concept, expanding its scope
beyond regression tasks to encompass classification and state-space models. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional
Gaussian process models, our proposed framework offers a robust and versatile
tool for a wide array of applications.

<p class="mathjax">Thyroid nodule segmentation is a crucial step in the diagnostic procedure of
physicians and computer-aided diagnosis systems. Mostly, current studies treat
segmentation and diagnosis as independent tasks without considering the
correlation between these tasks. The sequence steps of these independent tasks
in computer-aided diagnosis systems may lead to the accumulation of errors.
Therefore, it is worth combining them as a whole through exploring the
relationship between thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. According to
the thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS), the assessment of
shape and margin characteristics is the prerequisite for the discrimination of
benign and malignant thyroid nodules. These characteristics can be observed in
the thyroid nodule segmentation masks. Inspired by the diagnostic procedure of
TI-RADS, this paper proposes a shape-margin knowledge augmented network
(SkaNet) for simultaneously thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. Due to
the similarity in visual features between segmentation and diagnosis, SkaNet
shares visual features in the feature extraction stage and then utilizes a
dual-branch architecture to perform thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis
tasks simultaneously. To enhance effective discriminative features, an
exponential mixture module is devised, which incorporates convolutional feature
maps and self-attention maps by exponential weighting. Then, SkaNet is jointly
optimized by a knowledge augmented multi-task loss function with a constraint
penalty term. It embeds shape and margin characteristics through numerical
computation and models the relationship between the thyroid nodule diagnosis
results and segmentation masks.

<p class="mathjax">Solar flare forecasting research using machine learning (ML) has focused on
high resolution magnetogram data from the SDO/HMI era covering Solar Cycle 24
and the start of Solar Cycle 25, with some efforts looking back to SOHO/MDI for
data from Solar Cycle 23. In this paper, we consider over 4 solar cycles of
daily historical magnetogram data from multiple instruments. This is the first
attempt to take advantage of this historical data for ML-based flare
forecasting. We apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features
from full-disk magnetograms together with a logistic regression model to
incorporate scalar features based on magnetograms and flaring history. We use
an ensemble approach to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts of M-class
or larger flares in the next 24 hours. Overall, we find that including
historical data improves forecasting skill and reliability. We show that single
frame magnetograms do not contain significantly more relevant information than
can be summarized in a small number of scalar features, and that flaring
history has greater predictive power than our CNN-extracted features. This
indicates the importance of including temporal information in flare forecasting
models.

<p class="mathjax">The Pauli stabilizer formalism is perhaps the most thoroughly studied means
of procuring quantum error-correcting codes, whereby the code is obtained
through commutative Pauli operators and ``stabilized'' by them. In this work we
will show that every quantum error-correcting code, including Pauli stabilizer
codes and subsystem codes, has a similar structure, in that the code can be
stabilized by commutative ``Paulian'' operators which share many features with
Pauli operators and which form a \textbf{Paulian stabilizer group}. By
facilitating a controlled gate we can measure these Paulian operators to
acquire the error syndrome. Examples concerning codeword stabilized codes and
bosonic codes will be presented; specifically, one of the examples has been
demonstrated experimentally and the observable for detecting the error turns
out to be Paulian, thereby showing the potential utility of this approach. This
work provides a possible approach to implement error-correcting codes and to
find new codes.

<p class="mathjax">The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) is a heuristic hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions to
combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Satisfiability. While QAOA
is well-studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio
guarantees are still relatively sparse. We provide some of the first lower
bounds for the number of rounds (the dominant component of QAOA runtimes)
required for QAOA. For our main result, (i) we leverage a connection between
quantum annealing times and the angles of QAOA to derive a lower bound on the
number of rounds of QAOA with respect to the guaranteed approximation ratio. We
apply and calculate this bound with Grover-style mixing unitaries and (ii) show
that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to
guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. We also (iii)
show that the bound depends only on the statistical values of the objective
functions, and when the problem can be modeled as a $k$-local Hamiltonian, can
be easily estimated from the coefficients of the Hamiltonians. For the
conventional transverse field mixer, (iv) our framework gives a trivial lower
bound to all bounded occurrence local cost problems and all strictly $k$-local
cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is
obtainable with constant round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these
classes. Using our novel proof framework, (v) we recover the Grover lower bound
for unstructured search and -- with small modification -- show that our bound
applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of
the mixing unitaries.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is devoted to the development and convergence analysis of greedy
reconstruction algorithms based on the strategy presented in [Y. Maday and J.
Salomon, Joint Proceedings of the 48th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
and the 28th Chinese Control Conference, 2009, pp. 375--379]. These procedures
allow the design of a sequence of control functions that ease the
identification of unknown operators in nonlinear dynamical systems. The
original strategy of greedy reconstruction algorithms is based on an
offline/online decomposition of the reconstruction process and an ansatz for
the unknown operator obtained by an a priori chosen set of linearly independent
matrices. In the previous work [S. Buchwald, G. Ciaramella and J. Salomon, SIAM
J. Control Optim., 59(6), pp. 4511-4537], convergence results were obtained in
the case of linear identification problems. We tackle here the more general
case of nonlinear systems. More precisely, we introduce a new greedy algorithm
based on the linearized system. Then, we show that the controls obtained with
this new algorithm lead to the local convergence of the classical Gauss-Newton
method applied to the online nonlinear identification problem. We then extend
this result to the controls obtained on nonlinear systems where a local
convergence result is also proved. The main convergence results are obtained
for the reconstruction of drift operators in dynamical systems with linear and
bilinear control structures.
