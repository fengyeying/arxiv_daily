<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an investigation into machine learning techniques for
violence detection in videos and their adaptation to a federated learning
context. The study includes experiments with spatio-temporal features extracted
from benchmark video datasets, comparison of different methods, and proposal of
a modified version of the "Flow-Gated" architecture called "Diff-Gated."
Additionally, various machine learning techniques, including super-convergence
and transfer learning, are explored, and a method for adapting centralized

<p class="mathjax">Stroke is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, necessitating early
predictive strategies to minimize risks. Traditional methods for evaluating
patients, such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II,
IV) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III), have limited accuracy
and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel approach: an interpretable,
attention-based transformer model for early stroke mortality prediction. This
model seeks to address the limitations of previous predictive models, providing
both interpretability (providing clear, understandable explanations of the
model) and fidelity (giving a truthful explanation of the model's dynamics from
input to output). Furthermore, the study explores and compares fidelity and
interpretability scores using Shapley values and attention-based scores to
improve model explainability. The research objectives include designing an
interpretable attention-based transformer model, evaluating its performance
compared to existing models, and providing feature importance derived from the
model.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a technique for efficiently modeling dynamic humans by
explicifying the implicit neural fields via a Neural Explicit Surface (NES).
Implicit neural fields have advantages over traditional explicit
representations in modeling dynamic 3D content from sparse observations and
effectively representing complex geometries and appearances. Implicit neural
fields defined in 3D space, however, are expensive to render due to the need
for dense sampling during volumetric rendering. Moreover, their memory
efficiency can be further optimized when modeling sparse 3D space. To overcome
these issues, the paper proposes utilizing Neural Explicit Surface (NES) to
explicitly represent implicit neural fields, facilitating memory and
computational efficiency. To achieve this, the paper creates a fully
differentiable conversion between the implicit neural fields and the explicit
rendering interface of NES, leveraging the strengths of both implicit and
explicit approaches. This conversion enables effective training of the hybrid
representation using implicit methods and efficient rendering by integrating
the explicit rendering interface with a newly proposed rasterization-based
neural renderer that only incurs a texture color query once for the initial ray
interaction with the explicit surface, resulting in improved inference
efficiency. NES describes dynamic human geometries with pose-dependent neural
implicit surface deformation fields and their dynamic neural textures both in
2D space, which is a more memory-efficient alternative to traditional 3D
methods, reducing redundancy and computational load. The comprehensive
experiments show that NES performs similarly to previous 3D approaches, with
greatly improved rendering speed and reduced memory cost.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the field of data-driven neural network-based machine
learning (ML) algorithms has grown significantly and spurred research in its
applicability to instrumentation and control systems. While they are promising
in operational contexts, the trustworthiness of such algorithms is not
adequately assessed. Failures of ML-integrated systems are poorly understood;
the lack of comprehensive risk modeling can degrade the trustworthiness of
these systems. In recent reports by the National Institute for Standards and
Technology, trustworthiness in ML is a critical barrier to adoption and will
play a vital role in intelligent systems' safe and accountable operation. Thus,
in this work, we demonstrate a real-time model-agnostic method to evaluate the
relative reliability of ML predictions by incorporating out-of-distribution
detection on the training dataset. It is well documented that ML algorithms
excel at interpolation (or near-interpolation) tasks but significantly degrade
at extrapolation. This occurs when new samples are "far" from training samples.
The method, referred to as the Laplacian distributed decay for reliability
(LADDR), determines the difference between the operational and training
datasets, which is used to calculate a prediction's relative reliability. LADDR
is demonstrated on a feedforward neural network-based model used to predict
safety significant factors during different loss-of-flow transients. LADDR is
intended as a "data supervisor" and determines the appropriateness of
well-trained ML models in the context of operational conditions. Ultimately,
LADDR illustrates how training data can be used as evidence to support the
trustworthiness of ML predictions when utilized for conventional interpolation
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">As cyber threats evolve and grow progressively more sophisticated, cyber
security is becoming a more significant concern in today's digital era.
Traditional security measures tend to be insufficient to defend against these
persistent and dynamic threats because they are mainly intuitional. One of the
most promising ways to handle this ongoing problem is utilizing the potential
of data-driven intelligence, by leveraging AI and machine learning techniques.
It can improve operational efficiency and saves response times by automating
repetitive operations, enabling real-time threat detection, and facilitating
incident response. In addition, it augments human expertise with insightful
information, predictive analytics, and enhanced decision-making, enabling them
to better understand and address evolving problems. Thus, data-driven
intelligence could significantly improve real-world cybersecurity solutions in
a wide range of application areas like critical infrastructure, smart cities,
digital twin, industrial control systems and so on. In this position paper, we
argue that data-driven intelligence can revolutionize the realm of
cybersecurity, offering not only large-scale task automation but also assist
human experts for better situation awareness and decision-making in real-world
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">A significant number of machine learning models are vulnerable to model
extraction attacks, which focus on stealing the models by using specially
curated queries against the target model. This task is well accomplished by
using part of the training data or a surrogate dataset to train a new model
that mimics a target model in a white-box environment. In pragmatic situations,
however, the target models are trained on private datasets that are
inaccessible to the adversary. The data-free model extraction technique
replaces this problem when it comes to using queries artificially curated by a
generator similar to that used in Generative Adversarial Nets. We propose for
the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an adversary black box attack
extending to a regression problem for predicting bounding box coordinates in
object detection. As part of our study, we found that defining a loss function
and using a novel generator setup is one of the key aspects in extracting the
target model. We find that the proposed model extraction method achieves
significant results by using reasonable queries. The discovery of this object
detection vulnerability will support future prospects for securing such models.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we parallelize high-level features in deep networks to
selectively skip or select class-specific features to reduce inference costs.
This challenges most deep learning methods due to their limited ability to
efficiently and effectively focus on selected class-specific features without
retraining. We propose a serial-parallel hybrid architecture with serial
generic low-level features and parallel high-level features. This accounts for
the fact that many high-level features are class-specific rather than generic,
and has connections to recent neuroscientific findings that observe spatially
and contextually separated neural activations in the human brain. Our approach
provides the unique functionality of cutouts: selecting parts of the network to
focus on only relevant subsets of classes without requiring retraining. High
performance is maintained, but the cost of inference can be significantly
reduced. In some of our examples, up to $75\,\%$ of parameters are skipped and
$35\,\%$ fewer GMACs (Giga multiply-accumulate) operations are used as the
approach adapts to a change in task complexity. This is important for mobile,
industrial, and robotic applications where reducing the number of parameters,
the computational complexity, and thus the power consumption can be paramount.
Another unique functionality is that it allows processing to be directly
influenced by enhancing or inhibiting high-level class-specific features,
similar to the mechanism of selective attention in the human brain. This can be
relevant for cross-modal applications, the use of semantic prior knowledge,
and/or context-aware processing.

<p class="mathjax">Designing responsive visualizations for various screen types can be tedious
as authors must manage multiple chart~versions across design iterations.
Automated approaches for responsive visualization must take into account the
user's need for agency in exploring possible design ideas and applying
customizations based on their own goals. We design and implement Dupo, a
mixed-initiative approach to creating responsive visualizations that combines
the agency afforded by a manual interface with automation provided by a
recommender system. Given an initial design, users can browse automated design
suggestions for a different screen type and make edits to a chosen design,
thereby supporting quick prototyping and customizability. Dupo employs a
two-step recommender pipeline that first suggests significant design changes
(Exploration) followed by more subtle changes (Alteration). We evaluated Dupo
with six expert responsive visualization authors. While creating responsive
versions of a source design in Dupo, participants could reason about different
design suggestions without having to manually prototype them, and thus avoid
prematurely fixating on a particular design. This process led participants to
create designs that they were satisfied with but which they had previously
overlooked.

<p class="mathjax">Weakly supervised methods, such as class activation maps (CAM) based, have
been applied to achieve bleeding segmentation with low annotation efforts in
Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. However, the CAM labels tend to be
extremely noisy, and there is an irreparable gap between CAM labels and ground
truths for medical images. This paper proposes a new Discrepancy-basEd Active
Learning (DEAL) approach to bridge the gap between CAMs and ground truths with
a few annotations. Specifically, to liberate labor, we design a novel
discrepancy decoder model and a CAMPUS (CAM, Pseudo-label and groUnd-truth
Selection) criterion to replace the noisy CAMs with accurate model predictions
and a few human labels. The discrepancy decoder model is trained with a unique
scheme to generate standard, coarse and fine predictions. And the CAMPUS
criterion is proposed to predict the gaps between CAMs and ground truths based
on model divergence and CAM divergence. We evaluate our method on the WCE
dataset and results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
active learning methods and reaches comparable performance to those trained
with full annotated datasets with only 10% of the training data labeled.

<p class="mathjax">Object modeling has become a core part of recent tracking frameworks. Current
popular tackers use Transformer attention to extract the template feature
separately or interactively with the search region. However, separate template
learning lacks communication between the template and search regions, which
brings difficulty in extracting discriminative target-oriented features. On the
other hand, interactive template learning produces hybrid template features,
which may introduce potential distractors to the template via the cluttered
search regions. To enjoy the merits of both methods, we propose a robust object
modeling framework for visual tracking (ROMTrack), which simultaneously models
the inherent template and the hybrid template features. As a result, harmful
distractors can be suppressed by combining the inherent features of target
objects with search regions' guidance. Target-related features can also be
extracted using the hybrid template, thus resulting in a more robust object
modeling framework. To further enhance robustness, we present novel variation
tokens to depict the ever-changing appearance of target objects. Variation
tokens are adaptable to object deformation and appearance variations, which can
boost overall performance with negligible computation. Experiments show that
our ROMTrack sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">We address the challenge of sound propagation simulations in $3$D virtual
rooms with moving sources, which have applications in virtual/augmented
reality, game audio, and spatial computing. Solutions to the wave equation can
describe wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference. However,
simulating them using conventional numerical discretization methods with
hundreds of source and receiver positions is intractable, making stimulating a
sound field with moving sources impractical. To overcome this limitation, we
propose using deep operator networks to approximate linear wave-equation
operators. This enables the rapid prediction of sound propagation in realistic
3D acoustic scenes with moving sources, achieving millisecond-scale
computations. By learning a compact surrogate model, we avoid the offline
calculation and storage of impulse responses for all relevant source/listener
pairs. Our experiments, including various complex scene geometries, show good
agreement with reference solutions, with root mean squared errors ranging from
0.02 Pa to 0.10 Pa. Notably, our method signifies a paradigm shift as no prior
machine learning approach has achieved precise predictions of complete wave
fields within realistic domains. We anticipate that our findings will drive
further exploration of deep neural operator methods, advancing research in
immersive user experiences within virtual environments.

<p class="mathjax">Existing model evaluation tools mainly focus on evaluating classification
models, leaving a gap in evaluating more complex models, such as object
detection. In this paper, we develop an open-source visual analysis tool,
Uni-Evaluator, to support a unified model evaluation for classification, object
detection, and instance segmentation in computer vision. The key idea behind
our method is to formulate both discrete and continuous predictions in
different tasks as unified probability distributions. Based on these
distributions, we develop 1) a matrix-based visualization to provide an
overview of model performance; 2) a table visualization to identify the
problematic data subsets where the model performs poorly; 3) a grid
visualization to display the samples of interest. These visualizations work
together to facilitate the model evaluation from a global overview to
individual samples. Two case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of
Uni-Evaluator in evaluating model performance and making informed improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification,
speech recognition, scientific analysis and many more application areas. With
the ever-increasing need for faster computation and lower power consumption,
driven by real-time systems and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, FPGAs have
emerged as suitable devices for deep learning inference. Due to the high
computational complexity and memory footprint of neural networks, various
compression techniques, such as pruning, quantization and knowledge
distillation, have been proposed in literature. Pruning sparsifies a neural
network, reducing the number of multiplications and memory. However, pruning
often fails to capture properties of the underlying hardware, causing
unstructured sparsity and load-balance inefficiency, thus bottlenecking
resource improvements. We propose a hardware-centric formulation of pruning, by
formulating it as a knapsack problem with resource-aware tensor structures. The
primary emphasis is on real-time inference, with latencies in the order of
1$\mu$s, accelerated with hls4ml, an open-source framework for deep learning
inference on FPGAs. Evaluated on a range of tasks, including real-time particle
classification at CERN's Large Hadron Collider and fast image classification,
the proposed method achieves a reduction ranging between 55% and 92% in the
utilization of digital signal processing blocks (DSP) and up to 81% in block
memory (BRAM) utilization.

<p class="mathjax">The Rust programming language, with its safety guarantees, has established
itself as a viable choice for low-level systems programming language over the
traditional, unsafe alternatives like C/C++. These guarantees come from a
strong ownership-based type system, as well as primitive support for features
like closures, pattern matching, etc., that make the code more concise and
amenable to reasoning. These unique Rust features also pose a steep learning
curve for programmers.
<br />This paper presents a tool called RustAssistant that leverages the emergent
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically suggest fixes for
Rust compilation errors. RustAssistant uses a careful combination of prompting
techniques as well as iteration with an LLM to deliver high accuracy of fixes.
RustAssistant is able to achieve an impressive peak accuracy of roughly 74% on
real-world compilation errors in popular open-source Rust repositories. We plan
to release our dataset of Rust compilation errors to enable further research.

<p class="mathjax">In certain Asian countries, Jute is one of the primary sources of income and
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the agricultural sector. Like many other
crops, Jute is prone to pest infestations, and its identification is typically
made visually in countries like Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and China. In
addition, this method is time-consuming, challenging, and somewhat imprecise,
which poses a substantial financial risk. To address this issue, the study
proposes a high-performing and resilient transfer learning (TL) based
JutePestDetect model to identify jute pests at the early stage. Firstly, we
prepared jute pest dataset containing 17 classes and around 380 photos per pest
class, which were evaluated after manual and automatic pre-processing and
cleaning, such as background removal and resizing. Subsequently, five prominent
pre-trained models -DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, VGG19, and ResNet50
were selected from a previous study to design the JutePestDetect model. Each
model was revised by replacing the classification layer with a global average
pooling layer and incorporating a dropout layer for regularization. To evaluate
the models performance, various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score,
ROC curve, and confusion matrix were employed. These analyses provided
additional insights for determining the efficacy of the models. Among them, the
customized regularized DenseNet201-based proposed JutePestDetect model
outperformed the others, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99%. As a result,
our proposed method and strategy offer an enhanced approach to pest
identification in the case of Jute, which can significantly benefit farmers
worldwide.

<p class="mathjax">While diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models provide a simple and
powerful way to generate images, guiding this generation remains a challenge.
For concepts that are difficult to describe through language, users may
struggle to create prompts. Moreover, many of these models are built as
end-to-end systems, lacking support for iterative shaping of the image. In
response, we introduce PromptPaint, which combines T2I generation with
interactions that model how we use colored paints. PromptPaint allows users to
go beyond language to mix prompts that express challenging concepts. Just as we
iteratively tune colors through layered placements of paint on a physical
canvas, PromptPaint similarly allows users to apply different prompts to
different canvas areas and times of the generative process. Through a set of
studies, we characterize different approaches for mixing prompts, design
trade-offs, and socio-technical challenges for generative models. With
PromptPaint we provide insight into future steerable generative tools.

signal interference and transmission queue management, and their impacts on the
performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) when operating in the unlicensed
spectrum bands. In particular, we develop a comprehensive framework to
investigate the impact of other interference links on the UAV as it
communicates with the ground users. To this end, we provide closed-form
expressions for packet drop probabilities in the queue due to buffer overflow
or large queuing delay, which are expressed in terms of a transmission policy
as a function of the channel fading threshold $\beta$. The overall packet loss
caused either by interference signals or queuing packet drop is obtained,
which, in turn, yields in obtaining the expected throughput performance.
Through extensive numerical results, we investigate the impact of the channel
fading threshold $\beta$, which plays an important role in balancing the
trade-offs between packet loss due to queue drop or transmission error due to
large interference levels.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, the state of the art in the field of pedestrian trajectory
prediction is evaluated alongside the constant velocity model (CVM) with
respect to its applicability in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation is
conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. To align with
requirements in real-world applications, modifications are made to the input
features of the initially proposed models. An ablation study is conducted to
examine the influence of the observed motion history on the prediction
performance, thereby establishing a better understanding of its impact.
Additionally, the inference time of each model is measured to evaluate the
scalability of each model when confronted with varying amounts of agents. The
results demonstrate that simple models remain competitive when generating
single trajectories, and certain features commonly thought of as useful have
little impact on the overall performance across different architectures. Based
on these findings, recommendations are proposed to guide the future development
of trajectory prediction algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In edge computing environments, app vendors can cache their data to be shared
with their users in many geographically distributed edge servers. However, the
cached data is particularly vulnerable to several intentional attacks or
unintentional events. Given the limited resources of edge servers and
prohibitive storage costs incurred by app vendors, designing an efficient
approach to inspect and maintain the data over tremendous edge servers is a
critical issue. To tackle the problem, we design a novel data inspection
approach, named ${\text{O}^2\text{DI}}$, that provides the following services:
i) using ${\text{O}^2\text{DI}}$, app vendors can inspect the data cached in
edge servers without having the original data, which reduces the incurred I/O
and storage overhead significantly; ii) computational operations conducted by
both edge servers and app vendors are highly efficient because of a novel
online/offline technique; iii) many data files cached in different edge servers
can be verified quickly and at once by using a novel batch verification method;
iv) corrupted data in edge servers can be localized and repaired efficiently.
We analyze the security and performance of ${\text{O}^2\text{DI}}$. We see that
it is secure in the random oracle model, much faster, and more cost-effective
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">GPU-aware collective communication has become a major bottleneck for modern
computing platforms as GPU computing power rapidly rises. To address this
issue, traditional approaches integrate lossy compression directly into
GPU-aware collectives, which still suffer from serious issues such as
underutilized GPU devices and uncontrolled data distortion. In this paper, we
propose gZCCL, a general framework that designs and optimizes GPU-aware,
compression-enabled collectives with an accuracy-aware design to control error
propagation. To validate our framework, we evaluate the performance on up to
512 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with real-world applications and datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that our gZCCL-accelerated collectives, including both
collective computation (Allreduce) and collective data movement (Scatter), can
outperform NCCL as well as Cray MPI by up to 4.5X and 28.7X, respectively.
Furthermore, our accuracy evaluation with an image-stacking application
confirms the high reconstructed data quality of our accuracy-aware framework.

<p class="mathjax">With the advent of general-purpose Generative AI, the interest in discerning
its impact on the labor market escalates. In an attempt to bridge the extant
empirical void, we interpret the launch of ChatGPT as an exogenous shock, and
implement a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to quantify its influence
on text-related jobs and freelancers within an online labor marketplace. Our
results reveal a significant decrease in transaction volume for gigs and
freelancers directly exposed to ChatGPT. Additionally, this decline is
particularly marked in units of relatively higher past transaction volume or
lower quality standards. Yet, the negative effect is not universally
experienced among service providers. Subsequent analyses illustrate that
freelancers proficiently adapting to novel advancements and offering services
that augment AI technologies can yield substantial benefits amidst this
transformative period. Consequently, even though the advent of ChatGPT could
conceivably substitute existing occupations, it also unfolds immense
opportunities and carries the potential to reconfigure the future of work. This
research contributes to the limited empirical repository exploring the profound
influence of LLM-based generative AI on the labor market, furnishing invaluable
insights for workers, job intermediaries, and regulatory bodies navigating this
evolving landscape.

<p class="mathjax">Due to numerous applications in retail and (online) advertising the problem
of assortment selection has been widely studied under many combinations of
discrete choice models and feasibility constraints. In many situations,
however, an assortment of products has to be constructed gradually and without
accurate knowledge of all possible alternatives; in such cases, existing
offline approaches become inapplicable. We consider a stochastic variant of the
assortment selection problem, where the parameters that determine the revenue
and (relative) demand of each item are jointly drawn from some known
item-specific distribution. The items are observed sequentially in an arbitrary
and unknown order; upon observing the realized parameters of each item, the
decision-maker decides irrevocably whether to include it in the constructed
assortment, or forfeit it forever. The objective is to maximize the expected
total revenue of the constructed assortment, relative to that of an offline
algorithm which foresees all the parameter realizations and computes the
optimal assortment. We provide simple threshold-based online policies for the
unconstrained and cardinality-constrained versions of the problem under a
natural class of substitutable choice models; as we show, our policies are
(worst-case) optimal under the celebrated Multinomial Logit choice model. We
extend our results to the case of knapsack constraints and discuss interesting
connections to the Prophet Inequality problem, which is already subsumed by our
setting.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a strategy for identifying textual saliency in
large-scale language models applied to classification tasks. In visual networks
where saliency is more well-studied, saliency is naturally localized through
the convolutional layers of the network; however, the same is not true in
modern transformer-stack networks used to process natural language. We adapt
gradient-based saliency methods for these networks, propose a method for
evaluating the degree of semantic coherence of each layer, and demonstrate
consistent improvement over numerous other methods for textual saliency on
multiple benchmark classification datasets. Our approach requires no additional
training or access to labelled data, and is comparatively very computationally
efficient.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithms in public services such as child welfare, criminal justice, and
education are increasingly being used to make high-stakes decisions about human
lives. Drawing upon findings from a two-year ethnography conducted at a child
welfare agency, we highlight how algorithmic systems are embedded within a
complex decision-making ecosystem at critical points of the child welfare
process. Caseworkers interact with algorithms in their daily lives where they
must collect information about families and feed it to algorithms to make
critical decisions. We show how the interplay between systemic mechanics and
algorithmic decision-making can adversely impact the fairness of the
decision-making process itself. We show how functionality issues in algorithmic
systems can lead to process-oriented harms where they adversely affect the
nature of professional practice, and administration at the agency, and lead to
inconsistent and unreliable decisions at the street level. In addition,
caseworkers are compelled to undertake additional labor in the form of repair
work to restore disrupted administrative processes and decision-making, all
while facing organizational pressures and time and resource constraints.
Finally, we share the case study of a simple algorithmic tool that centers
caseworkers' decision-making within a trauma-informed framework and leads to
better outcomes, however, required a significant amount of investments on the
agency's part in creating the ecosystem for its proper use.

<p class="mathjax">NAND flash memory-based IoT devices inherently suffer from data retention
issues. In IoT security, these retention issues are significant and require a
robust solution for secure deletion. Secure deletion methods can be categorized
into off-chip and on-chip schemes. Off-chip secure deletion schemes, based on
block-level erasure operations, are unable to perform real-time trim
operations. Consequently, they are vulnerable to hacking threats. On the other
hand, on-chip secure deletion schemes enable real-time trim operations by
performing deletion on a page-by-page basis. However, the on-chip scheme
introduces a challenge of program disturbance for neighboring page data. The
proposed on-chip deletion scheme tackles this problem by utilizing ECC code
modulation through a partial program operation. This approach significantly
reduces the program disturbance issue associated with neighboring page data.
Moreover, the proposed code modulation secure deletion scheme allows for
real-time verification of the deletion of original data.

<p class="mathjax">Surgical instrument segmentation is recognised as a key enabler to provide
advanced surgical assistance and improve computer assisted interventions. In
this work, we propose SegMatch, a semi supervised learning method to reduce the
need for expensive annotation for laparoscopic and robotic surgical images.
SegMatch builds on FixMatch, a widespread semi supervised classification
pipeline combining consistency regularization and pseudo labelling, and adapts
it for the purpose of segmentation. In our proposed SegMatch, the unlabelled
images are weakly augmented and fed into the segmentation model to generate a
pseudo-label to enforce the unsupervised loss against the output of the model
for the adversarial augmented image on the pixels with a high confidence score.
Our adaptation for segmentation tasks includes carefully considering the
equivariance and invariance properties of the augmentation functions we rely
on. To increase the relevance of our augmentations, we depart from using only
handcrafted augmentations and introduce a trainable adversarial augmentation
strategy. Our algorithm was evaluated on the MICCAI Instrument Segmentation
Challenge datasets Robust-MIS 2019 and EndoVis 2017. Our results demonstrate
that adding unlabelled data for training purposes allows us to surpass the
performance of fully supervised approaches which are limited by the
availability of training data in these challenges. SegMatch also outperforms a
range of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning semantic segmentation models
in different labelled to unlabelled data ratios.

<p class="mathjax">Environmental perception is a key element of autonomous driving because the
information received from the perception module influences core driving
decisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous
driving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and
latency. Major constraints on both computation and power have to be taken into
account for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger object
detection models tend to produce the best results, but are also slower at
runtime. Since the most accurate detectors cannot run in real-time locally, we
investigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud
platforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset
to train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies.
Using real hardware and network simulations, we compare different trade-offs
between prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Since sending raw frames over
the network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of
JPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on
prediction metrics. We show that models with adequate compression can be run in
real-time on the cloud while outperforming local detection performance.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are models that are utilized extensively
for the hierarchical extraction of features. Vision transformers (ViTs),
through the use of a self-attention mechanism, have recently achieved superior
modeling of global contextual information compared to CNNs. However, to realize
their image classification strength, ViTs require substantial training
datasets. Where the available training data are limited, current advanced
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can provide viable alternatives to both deep
CNNs and ViTs. In this paper, we developed the SGU-MLP, a learning algorithm
that effectively uses both MLPs and spatial gating units (SGUs) for precise
land use land cover (LULC) mapping. Results illustrated the superiority of the
developed SGU-MLP classification algorithm over several CNN and CNN-ViT-based
models, including HybridSN, ResNet, iFormer, EfficientFormer and CoAtNet. The
proposed SGU-MLP algorithm was tested through three experiments in Houston,
USA, Berlin, Germany and Augsburg, Germany. The SGU-MLP classification model
was found to consistently outperform the benchmark CNN and CNN-ViT-based
algorithms. For example, for the Houston experiment, SGU-MLP significantly
outperformed HybridSN, CoAtNet, Efficientformer, iFormer and ResNet by
approximately 15%, 19%, 20%, 21%, and 25%, respectively, in terms of average
accuracy. The code will be made publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Several architecture frameworks for software, systems, and enterprises have
been proposed in the literature. They identified various stakeholders and
defined architecture viewpoints and views to frame and address stakeholder
concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML)
related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be
included in existing architecture frameworks. Therefore, they failed to address
the architecture viewpoints and views responsive to the concerns of the data
science community. In this paper, we address this gap by establishing the
architecture frameworks adapted to meet the requirements of modern applications
and organizations where ML artifacts are both prevalent and crucial. In
particular, we focus on ML-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and propose
two sets of merit criteria for their efficient development and performance
assessment, namely the criteria for evaluating and benchmarking ML-enabled
CPSs, and the criteria for evaluation and benchmarking of the tools intended to
support users through the modeling and development pipeline. In this study, we
deploy multiple empirical and qualitative research methods based on literature
review and survey instruments including expert interviews and an online
questionnaire. We collect, analyze, and integrate the opinions of 77 experts
from more than 25 organizations in over 10 countries to devise and validate the
proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">This study performs an ablation analysis of Vector Quantized Generative
Adversarial Networks (VQGANs), concentrating on image-to-image synthesis
utilizing a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The current work explores the nuanced
effects of varying critical parameters including the number of epochs, image
count, and attributes of codebook vectors and latent dimensions, specifically
within the constraint of limited resources. Notably, our focus is pinpointed on
the vector quantization loss, keeping other hyperparameters and loss components
(GAN loss) fixed. This was done to delve into a deeper understanding of the
discrete latent space, and to explore how varying its size affects the
reconstruction. Though, our results do not surpass the existing benchmarks,
however, our findings shed significant light on VQGAN's behaviour for a smaller
dataset, particularly concerning artifacts, codebook size optimization, and
comparative analysis with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The study also
uncovers the promising direction by introducing 2D positional encodings,
revealing a marked reduction in artifacts and insights into balancing clarity
and overfitting.

<p class="mathjax">Alas, coordinated hate attacks, or raids, are becoming increasingly common
online. In a nutshell, these are perpetrated by a group of aggressors who
organize and coordinate operations on a platform (e.g., 4chan) to target
victims on another community (e.g., YouTube). In this paper, we focus on
attributing raids to their source community, paving the way for moderation
approaches that take the context (and potentially the motivation) of an attack
into consideration. We present TUBERAIDER, an attribution system achieving over
75% accuracy in detecting and attributing coordinated hate attacks on YouTube
videos. We instantiate it using links to YouTube videos shared on 4chan's /pol/
board, r/The_Donald, and 16 Incels-related subreddits. We use a peak detector
to identify a rise in the comment activity of a YouTube video, which signals
that an attack may be occurring. We then train a machine learning classifier
based on the community language (i.e., TF-IDF scores of relevant keywords) to
perform the attribution. We test TUBERAIDER in the wild and present a few case
studies of actual aggression attacks identified by it to showcase its
effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel deep-learning based generator of synthetic
graphs that represent intra-Autonomous System (AS) in the Internet, named
Deep-generative graphs for the Internet (DGGI). It also presents a novel
massive dataset of real intra-AS graphs extracted from the project Internet
Topology Data Kit (ITDK), called Internet Graphs (IGraphs). To create IGraphs,
the Filtered Recurrent Multi-level (FRM) algorithm for community extraction was
developed. It is shown that DGGI creates synthetic graphs which accurately
reproduce the properties of centrality, clustering, assortativity, and node
degree. The DGGI generator overperforms existing Internet topology generators.
On average, DGGI improves the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric 84.4%,
95.1%, 97.9%, and 94.7% for assortativity, betweenness, clustering, and node
degree, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate the formation and evolution of social
processes at a fundamental level by decoupling agent behavior from global
observations. In the case where ABM networks evolve over time as a result of
(or in conjunction with) agent states, there is a need for understanding the
relationship between the dynamic processes and network structure. Social
networks provide a natural set of tools for understanding the emergent
relationships of these systems. This work examines the utility of a collection
of network comparison methods for the purpose of tracking network changes in an
ABM over time or between model parameters. Among the techniques examined is a
novel graph pseudometric based on heat content asymptotics, which have been
shown to distinguish many isospectral graphs which are not isomorphic.
Additionally, we establish the use of observations about real-world networks
from network science (e.g. fat-tailed degree distribution, small-world
property) for ABM validation in the case where empirical population data is
unavailable. These methods are all demonstrated on systematic perturbations of
an original model simulating the formation of friendships in a population of
20,000 agents in Cincinnati, OH.

<p class="mathjax">Aphids are efficient vectors to transmit virus yellows in sugar beet fields.
Timely monitoring and control of their populations are thus critical to prevent
the large-scale outbreak of virus yellows. However, the manual counting of
aphids, which is the most common practice, is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. Additionally, two of the biggest challenges in aphid counting
are that aphids are small objects and their density distributions are varied in
different areas of the field. To address these challenges, we proposed a hybrid
automatic aphid counting network architecture which integrates the detection
network and the density map estimation network. When the distribution density
of aphids is low, it utilizes an improved Yolov5 to count aphids. Conversely,
when the distribution density of aphids is high, its witches to CSRNet to count
aphids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework integrating
the detection network and the density map estimation network for counting
tasks. Through comparison experiments of counting aphids, it verified that our
proposed approach outperforms all other methods in counting aphids. It achieved
the lowest MAE and RMSE values for both the standard and high-density aphid
datasets: 2.93 and 4.01 (standard), and 34.19 and 38.66 (high-density),
respectively. Moreover, the AP of the improved Yolov5 is 5% higher than that of
the original Yolov5. Especially for extremely small aphids and densely
distributed aphids, the detection performance of the improved Yolov5 is
significantly better than the original Yolov5. This work provides an effective
early warning for the virus yellows risk caused by aphids in sugar beet fields,
offering protection for sugar beet growth and ensuring sugar beet yield. The
datasets and project code are released at:

Firstly, we suggest the inclusion of an additional index that accounts for

<p class="mathjax">The evaluation datasets and metrics for image manipulation detection and
localization (IMDL) research have been standardized. But the training dataset
for such a task is still nonstandard. Previous researchers have used
unconventional and deviating datasets to train neural networks for detecting
image forgeries and localizing pixel maps of manipulated regions. For a fair
comparison, the training set, test set, and evaluation metrics should be
persistent. Hence, comparing the existing methods may not seem fair as the
results depend heavily on the training datasets as well as the model
architecture. Moreover, none of the previous works release the synthetic
training dataset used for the IMDL task. We propose a standardized benchmark
training dataset for image splicing, copy-move forgery, removal forgery, and
image enhancement forgery. Furthermore, we identify the problems with the
existing IMDL datasets and propose the required modifications. We also train
the state-of-the-art IMDL methods on our proposed TrainFors1 dataset for a fair
evaluation and report the actual performance of these methods under similar

<p class="mathjax">We study the stability of freeway traffic flow under output-feedback ramp
metering in cases of incomplete information about the traffic flow state. We
propose a set-membership estimation method for the cell transmission model with
capacity drops and design a model predictive controller accordingly. This
controller has linear running and terminal costs in cell densities, and its
output comprises density measurements from a subset of the cells, e.g., through
loop detectors or connected vehicles. For a line network, we provide sufficient
conditions under which the traffic system is input-to-state stable, meaning the
ramp queue length remains bounded, on the control horizons, cost coefficients,
and the inflows at the ramps. To further relax the requirement on exact
knowledge of model parameters, we design a model-free controller that computes
metering rates directly from measurement data. In addition to the proposed
controllers, we provide extensive simulations of other ramp metering algorithms
in the literature as baselines for evaluating performance. Simulation results
show that traffic flow is unstable without ramp metering or with other ramp
metering methods under high inflows, congested initial conditions, and
incomplete state measurements. In contrast, the designed model predictive and
model-free controllers stabilize traffic flow and provide higher throughput
with measurements from an arbitrary subset of the cells.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a self-training approach for automatic speech
recognition (ASR) for low-resource settings. While self-training approaches
have been extensively developed and evaluated for high-resource languages such
as English, their applications to low-resource languages like Punjabi have been
limited, despite the language being spoken by millions globally. The scarcity
of annotated data has hindered the development of accurate ASR systems,
especially for low-resource languages (e.g., Punjabi and M\=aori languages). To
address this issue, we propose an effective self-training approach that
generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled low-resource speech. Our
experimental analysis demonstrates that our approach significantly improves
word error rate, achieving a relative improvement of 14.94% compared to a
baseline model across four real speech datasets. Further, our proposed approach
reports the best results on the Common Voice Punjabi dataset.

event-driven architecture on performance, stability, and software monitoring,
among others. Consequently, professionals end up adopting it without any
empirical evidence about its impact. Even worse, the current literature lacks
studies that point to which emerging research directions need to be explored.
This article proposes an agenda for future research based on the scarcity of
literature in the field of event-oriented architecture. This agenda was derived
from a literature review and a case study carried out, as well as from the
authors' experience. Eight main topics were explored in this work: performance
analysis, empirical studies, architectural stability, challenges to adopting,
monitoring event streams, effects on software performance, broader challenges
for adoption, and better monitoring of event-driven architecture. The findings
reported help the researchers and developers in prioritizing the critical
difficulties for uncovering the hidden potential of event-driven architecture.
Finally, this article seeks to help researchers and professionals by proposing
an agenda as a starting point for their research.

<p class="mathjax">The task of dynamic scene graph generation (DynSGG) aims to generate scene
graphs for given videos, which involves modeling the spatial-temporal
information in the video. However, due to the long-tailed distribution of
samples in the dataset, previous DynSGG models fail to predict the tail
predicates. We argue that this phenomenon is due to previous methods that only
pay attention to the local spatial-temporal information and neglect the
consistency of multiple frames. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
DynSGG model based on multi-task learning, DynSGG-MTL, which introduces the
local interaction information and global human-action interaction information.
The interaction between objects and frame features makes the model more fully
understand the visual context of the single image. Long-temporal human actions
supervise the model to generate multiple scene graphs that conform to the
global constraints and avoid the model being unable to learn the tail
predicates. Extensive experiments on Action Genome dataset demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed framework, which not only improves the dynamic scene
graph generation but also alleviates the long-tail problem.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, heterogeneous graph few-shot learning has been proposed to
address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which contain
various types of nodes and edges. The existing methods have achieved good
performance by transferring generalized knowledge extracted from rich-labeled
classes in source HG(s) to few-labeled classes in a target HG. However, these
methods only consider the single-heterogeneity scenario where the source and
target HGs share a fixed set of node/edge types, ignoring the more general
scenario of cross-heterogeneity, where each HG can have a different and
non-fixed set of node/edge types. To this end, we focus on the unexplored
cross-heterogeneity scenario and propose a novel model for Cross-heterogeneity
Graph Few-shot Learning, namely CGFL. In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns
to capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous
graph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose
a score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine
the transferability of each source HG. Finally, by integrating MHGN and the
score module into a meta-learning mechanism, CGFL can effectively transfer
generalized knowledge to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior
performance of CGFL over the state-of-the-art methods.

(or balance) instability theory has emerged as one of the primary hypotheses
for the cause of VR sickness. In this paper, we conducted a two-week-long
experiment to observe the trends in user balance learning and sickness
tolerance under different experimental conditions to analyze the potential
inter-relationship between them. The experimental results have shown, aside
from the obvious improvement in balance performance itself, that accompanying
balance training had a stronger effect of increasing tolerance to VR sickness

lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) model for the two-dimensional diffusion equation
with the constant diffusion coefficient and source term, where the D2Q5 (five
discrete velocities in two-dimensional space) lattice structure is considered.
Then we exactly derive the equivalent macroscopic finite-difference scheme of
the MRT-LB model. Additionally, we also propose a proper MRT-LB model for the
diffusion equation with a linear source term, and obtain an equivalent
macroscopic six-level finite-difference scheme. After that, we conduct the
accuracy and stability analysis of the finite-difference scheme and the
mesoscopic MRT-LB model. It is found that at the diffusive scaling, both of
them can achieve a fourth-order accuracy in space based on the Taylor
expansion. The stability analysis also shows that they are both unconditionally
stable. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted, and the numerical
results are also consistent with our theoretical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Effective disaster response is critical for affected communities. Responders
and decision-makers would benefit from reliable, timely measures of the issues
impacting their communities during a disaster, and social media offers a
potentially rich data source. Social media can reflect public concerns and
demands during a disaster, offering valuable insights for decision-makers to
understand evolving situations and optimize resource allocation. We used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) topic modeling
to cluster topics from Twitter data. Then, we conducted a temporal-spatial
analysis to examine the distribution of these topics across different regions
during the 2020 western U.S. wildfire season. Our results show that Twitter
users mainly focused on three topics:"health impact," "damage," and
"evacuation." We used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) theory to
explore the magnitude and velocity of topic diffusion on Twitter. The results
displayed a clear relationship between topic trends and wildfire propagation
patterns. The estimated parameters obtained from the SIR model in selected
cities revealed that residents exhibited a high level of several concerns
during the wildfire. Our study details how the SIR model and topic modeling
using social media data can provide decision-makers with a quantitative
approach to measure disaster response and support their decision-making
processes.

<p class="mathjax">Scene graph generation aims to detect visual relationship triplets, (subject,
predicate, object). Due to biases in data, current models tend to predict
common predicates, e.g. "on" and "at", instead of informative ones, e.g.
"standing on" and "looking at". This tendency results in the loss of precise
information and overall performance. If a model only uses "stone on road"
rather than "stone blocking road" to describe an image, it may be a grave
misunderstanding. We argue that this phenomenon is caused by two imbalances:
semantic space level imbalance and training sample level imbalance. For this
problem, we propose DB-SGG, an effective framework based on debiasing but not
the conventional distribution fitting. It integrates two components: Semantic
Debiasing (SD) and Balanced Predicate Learning (BPL), for these imbalances. SD
utilizes a confusion matrix and a bipartite graph to construct predicate
relationships. BPL adopts a random undersampling strategy and an ambiguity
removing strategy to focus on informative predicates. Benefiting from the
model-agnostic process, our method can be easily applied to SGG models and
outperforms Transformer by 136.3%, 119.5%, and 122.6% on mR@20 at three SGG
sub-tasks on the SGG-VG dataset. Our method is further verified on another
complex SGG dataset (SGG-GQA) and two downstream tasks (sentence-to-graph
retrieval and image captioning).

systems has seen great advances in the last three decades. However, the
application of these tools to sophisticated multiphysics systems such as
fluid-structure interactions is still lagging behind, mainly due to the
multidisciplinary and complex nature of such systems. In this work, we
implement topology optimization of high-fidelity, fully-coupled fluid-structure
interaction problems with large deformations. We use the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to deform the fluid mesh as a pseudo-structural
system such that structural deformations are completely reflected in the fluid
flow mesh. The fluid-structure interaction problem is formulated using the
three-field formulation and the sensitivity analysis is derived using the
discrete adjoint approach. We show through numerical examples the effect of the
projection and interpolation parameters on the convergence and topology of the
optimized designs and demonstrate the effect of considering the structural
deformations in the fluid mesh.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies Byzantine-robust stochastic optimization over a
decentralized network, where every agent periodically communicates with its
neighbors to exchange local models, and then updates its own local model by
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The performance of such a method is affected
by an unknown number of Byzantine agents, which conduct adversarially during
the optimization process. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing
work that simultaneously achieves a linear convergence speed and a small
learning error. We observe that the learning error is largely dependent on the
intrinsic stochastic gradient noise. Motivated by this observation, we
introduce two variance reduction methods, stochastic average gradient algorithm
(SAGA) and loopless stochastic variance-reduced gradient (LSVRG), to
Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic optimization for eliminating the
negative effect of the stochastic gradient noise. The two resulting methods,
BRAVO-SAGA and BRAVO-LSVRG, enjoy both linear convergence speeds and stochastic
gradient noise-independent learning errors. Such learning errors are optimal
for a class of methods based on total variation (TV)-norm regularization and
stochastic subgradient update. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to
demonstrate their effectiveness under various Byzantine attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Recently developed pretrained models can encode rich world knowledge
expressed in multiple modalities, such as text and images. However, the outputs
of these models cannot be integrated into algorithms to solve sequential
decision-making tasks. We develop an algorithm that utilizes the knowledge from
pretrained models to construct and verify controllers for sequential
decision-making tasks, and to ground these controllers to task environments
through visual observations. In particular, the algorithm queries a pretrained
model with a user-provided, text-based task description and uses the model's
output to construct an automaton-based controller that encodes the model's
task-relevant knowledge. It then verifies whether the knowledge encoded in the
controller is consistent with other independently available knowledge, which
may include abstract information on the environment or user-provided
specifications. If this verification step discovers any inconsistency, the
algorithm automatically refines the controller to resolve the inconsistency.
Next, the algorithm leverages the vision and language capabilities of
pretrained models to ground the controller to the task environment. It collects
image-based observations from the task environment and uses the pretrained
model to link these observations to the text-based control logic encoded in the
controller (e.g., actions and conditions that trigger the actions). We propose
a mechanism to ensure the controller satisfies the user-provided specification
even when perceptual uncertainties are present. We demonstrate the algorithm's
ability to construct, verify, and ground automaton-based controllers through a
suite of real-world tasks, including daily life and robot manipulation tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing 3D poses from 2D poses lacking depth information is
particularly challenging due to the complexity and diversity of human motion.
The key is to effectively model the spatial constraints between joints to
leverage their inherent dependencies. Thus, we propose a novel model, called
Double-chain Graph Convolutional Transformer (DC-GCT), to constrain the pose
through a double-chain design consisting of local-to-global and global-to-local
chains to obtain a complex representation more suitable for the current human
pose. Specifically, we combine the advantages of GCN and Transformer and design
a Local Constraint Module (LCM) based on GCN and a Global Constraint Module
(GCM) based on self-attention mechanism as well as a Feature Interaction Module
(FIM). The proposed method fully captures the multi-level dependencies between
human body joints to optimize the modeling capability of the model. Moreover,
we propose a method to use temporal information into the single-frame model by
guiding the video sequence embedding through the joint embedding of the target
frame, with negligible increase in computational cost. Experimental results
demonstrate that DC-GCT achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
challenging datasets (Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP). Notably, our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on all action categories in the Human3.6M dataset
using detected 2D poses from CPN, and our code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study state estimation of multi-visual-inertial systems
(MVIS) and develop sensor fusion algorithms to optimally fuse an arbitrary
number of asynchronous inertial measurement units (IMUs) or gyroscopes and
global and(or) rolling shutter cameras. We are especially interested in the
full calibration of the associated visual-inertial sensors, including the IMU
or camera intrinsics and the IMU-IMU(or camera) spatiotemporal extrinsics as
well as the image readout time of rolling-shutter cameras (if used). To this
end, we develop a new analytic combined IMU integration with intrinsics-termed
ACI3-to preintegrate IMU measurements, which is leveraged to fuse auxiliary
IMUs and(or) gyroscopes alongside a base IMU. We model the multi-inertial
measurements to include all the necessary inertial intrinsic and IMU-IMU
spatiotemporal extrinsic parameters, while leveraging IMU-IMU rigid-body
constraints to eliminate the necessity of auxiliary inertial poses and thus
reducing computational complexity. By performing observability analysis of
MVIS, we prove that the standard four unobservable directions remain - no
matter how many inertial sensors are used, and also identify, for the first
time, degenerate motions for IMU-IMU spatiotemporal extrinsics and auxiliary
inertial intrinsics. In addition to the extensive simulations that validate our
analysis and algorithms, we have built our own MVIS sensor rig and collected
over 25 real-world datasets to experimentally verify the proposed calibration
against the state-of-the-art calibration method such as Kalibr. We show that
the proposed MVIS calibration is able to achieve competing accuracy with
improved convergence and repeatability, which is open sourced to better benefit
the community.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider a way to safely navigate the robots in unknown
environments using measurement data from sensory devices. The control barrier
function (CBF) is one of the promising approaches to encode safety requirements
of the system and the recent progress on learning-based approaches for CBF
realizes online synthesis of CBF-based safe controllers with sensor
measurements. However, the existing methods are inefficient in the sense that
the trained CBF cannot be generalized to different environments and the
re-synthesis of the controller is necessary when changes in the environment
occur. Thus, this paper considers a way to learn CBF that can quickly adapt to
a new environment with few amount of data by utilizing the currently developed
Bayesian meta-learning framework. The proposed scheme realizes efficient online
synthesis of the controller as shown in the simulation study and provides
probabilistic safety guarantees on the resulting controller.

<p class="mathjax">Graph clustering is a fundamental task in graph analysis, and recent advances
in utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive results.
Despite the success of existing GNN-based graph clustering methods, they often
overlook the quality of graph structure, which is inherent in real-world graphs
due to their sparse and multifarious nature, leading to subpar performance.
Graph structure learning allows refining the input graph by adding missing
links and removing spurious connections. However, previous endeavors in graph
structure learning have predominantly centered around supervised settings, and
cannot be directly applied to our specific clustering tasks due to the absence
of ground-truth labels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method called
\textbf{ho}mophily-enhanced structure \textbf{le}arning for graph clustering
(HoLe). Our motivation stems from the observation that subtly enhancing the
degree of homophily within the graph structure can significantly improve GNNs
and clustering outcomes. To realize this objective, we develop two
clustering-oriented structure learning modules, i.e., hierarchical correlation
estimation and cluster-aware sparsification. The former module enables a more
accurate estimation of pairwise node relationships by leveraging guidance from
latent and clustering spaces, while the latter one generates a sparsified
structure based on the similarity matrix and clustering assignments.
Additionally, we devise a joint optimization approach alternating between
training the homophily-enhanced structure learning and GNN-based clustering,
thereby enforcing their reciprocal effects. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmark datasets of various types and scales, across a range of clustering
metrics, demonstrate the superiority of HoLe against state-of-the-art
baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Domain adaptation is commonly employed in crowd counting to bridge the domain
gaps between different datasets. However, existing domain adaptation methods
tend to focus on inter-dataset differences while overlooking the
intra-differences within the same dataset, leading to additional learning
ambiguities. These domain-agnostic factors, e.g., density, surveillance
perspective, and scale, can cause significant in-domain variations, and the
misalignment of these factors across domains can lead to a drop in performance
in cross-domain crowd counting. To address this issue, we propose a
Domain-agnostically Aligned Optimal Transport (DAOT) strategy that aligns
domain-agnostic factors between domains. The DAOT consists of three steps.
First, individual-level differences in domain-agnostic factors are measured
using structural similarity (SSIM). Second, the optimal transfer (OT) strategy
is employed to smooth out these differences and find the optimal
domain-to-domain misalignment, with outlier individuals removed via a virtual
"dustbin" column. Third, knowledge is transferred based on the aligned
domain-agnostic factors, and the model is retrained for domain adaptation to
bridge the gap across domains. We conduct extensive experiments on five
standard crowd-counting benchmarks and demonstrate that the proposed method has
strong generalizability across diverse datasets. Our code will be available at:
https://github.com/HopooLinZ/DAOT/.

<p class="mathjax">The current point cloud registration methods are mainly based on geometric
information and usually ignore the semantic information in the point clouds. In
this paper, we treat the point cloud registration problem as semantic instance
matching and registration task, and propose a deep semantic graph matching
method for large-scale outdoor point cloud registration. Firstly, the semantic
category labels of 3D point clouds are obtained by utilizing large-scale point
cloud semantic segmentation network. The adjacent points with the same category
labels are then clustered together by using Euclidean clustering algorithm to
obtain the semantic instances. Secondly, the semantic adjacency graph is
constructed based on the spatial adjacency relation of semantic instances.
Three kinds of high-dimensional features including geometric shape features,
semantic categorical features and spatial distribution features are learned
through graph convolutional network, and enhanced based on attention mechanism.
Thirdly, the semantic instance matching problem is modeled as an optimal
transport problem, and solved through an optimal matching layer. Finally,
according to the matched semantic instances, the geometric transformation
matrix between two point clouds is first obtained by SVD algorithm and then
refined by ICP algorithm. The experiments are cconducted on the KITTI Odometry
dataset, and the average relative translation error and average relative
rotation error of the proposed method are 6.6cm and 0.229{\deg} respectively.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel approach for structured data-to-text generation that
addresses the limitations of existing methods that primarily focus on specific
types of structured data. Our proposed method aims to improve performance in
multi-task training, zero-shot and few-shot scenarios by providing a unified
representation that can handle various forms of structured data such as tables,
knowledge graph triples, and meaning representations. We demonstrate that our
proposed approach can effectively adapt to new structured forms, and can
improve performance in comparison to current methods. For example, our method
resulted in a 66% improvement in zero-shot BLEU scores when transferring models

<p class="mathjax">Robust estimation is a crucial and still challenging task, which involves
estimating model parameters in noisy environments. Although conventional
sampling consensus-based algorithms sample several times to achieve robustness,
these algorithms cannot use data features and historical information
effectively. In this paper, we propose RLSAC, a novel Reinforcement Learning
enhanced SAmple Consensus framework for end-to-end robust estimation. RLSAC
employs a graph neural network to utilize both data and memory features to
guide exploring directions for sampling the next minimum set. The feedback of
downstream tasks serves as the reward for unsupervised training. Therefore,
RLSAC can avoid differentiating to learn the features and the feedback of
downstream tasks for end-to-end robust estimation. In addition, RLSAC
integrates a state transition module that encodes both data and memory
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that RLSAC can learn from
features to gradually explore a better hypothesis. Through analysis, it is
apparent that RLSAC can be easily transferred to other sampling consensus-based
robust estimation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, RLSAC is also the first
method that uses reinforcement learning to sample consensus for end-to-end
robust estimation. We release our codes at https://github.com/IRMVLab/RLSAC.

<p class="mathjax">The rudimentary adversarial attacks utilize additive noise to attack facial
recognition (FR) models. However, because manipulating the total face is
impractical in the physical setting, most real-world FR attacks are based on
adversarial patches, which limit perturbations to a small area. Previous
adversarial patch attacks often resulted in unnatural patterns and clear
boundaries that were easily noticeable. In this paper, we argue that generating
adversarial patches with plausible content can result in stronger
transferability than using additive noise or directly sampling from the latent
space. To generate natural-looking and highly transferable adversarial patches,
we propose an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine attack framework called
Adv-Inpainting. In the first stage, we propose an attention-guided StyleGAN
(Att-StyleGAN) that adaptively combines texture and identity features based on
the attention map to generate high-transferable and natural adversarial
patches. In the second stage, we design a refinement network with a new
boundary variance loss to further improve the coherence between the patch and
its surrounding area. Experiment results demonstrate that Adv-Inpainting is
stealthy and can produce adversarial patches with stronger transferability and
improved visual quality than previous adversarial patch attacks.

<p class="mathjax">User identity linkage (UIL), matching accounts of a person on different
social networks, is a fundamental task in cross-network data mining. Recent
works have achieved promising results by exploiting graph neural networks
(GNNs) to capture network structure. However, they rarely analyze the realistic
node-level bottlenecks that hinder UIL's performance. First, node degrees in a
graph vary widely and are long-tailed. A significant fraction of tail nodes
with small degrees are underrepresented due to limited structural information,
degrading linkage performance seriously. The second bottleneck usually
overlooked is super head nodes. It is commonly accepted that head nodes perform
well. However, we find that some of them with super high degrees also have
difficulty aligning counterparts, due to noise introduced by the randomness of
following friends in real-world social graphs. In pursuit of learning ideal
representations for these two groups of nodes, this paper proposes a
degree-aware model named DegUIL to narrow the degree gap. To this end, our
model complements missing neighborhoods for tail nodes and discards redundant
structural information for super head nodes in embeddings respectively.
Specifically, the neighboring bias is predicted and corrected locally by two
modules, which are trained using the knowledge from structurally adequate head
nodes. As a result, ideal neighborhoods are obtained for meaningful aggregation
in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model. Our
data and code can be found at https://github.com/Longmeix/DegUIL.

full-duplex (FD) system, considering the effect of phase noise introduced by
the oscillators at both the local transmitter and receiver. In particular, an
universal iterative two-stage joint SI cancellation and data detection
framework is considered and its performance bound independent of any specific
estimation and detection methods is derived. First, the channel and phase noise
estimation mean square error (MSE) lower bounds in each iteration are derived
by analyzing the Fisher information of the received signal. Then, by
substituting the derived MSE lower bound into the SINR expression, which is
related to the channel and phase noise estimation MSE, the SINR upper bound in
each iteration is computed. Finally, by exploiting the SINR upper bound and the
transition information of the detection errors between two adjacent iterations,
the universal bit error rate (BER) lower bound for data detection is derived.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, the digital self-interference (SI) cancellation in a single
radio frequency (RF) chain massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) full-duplex
(FD) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with phase noise
is studied. To compensate the phase noise, which introduces SI channel
estimation error and thus degrades the SI cancellation performance, a weighted
linear SI channel estimator is derived to minimize the residual SI power in
each OFDM symbol. The digital SI cancellation ability of the proposed method,
which is defined as the ratio of the SI power before and after the SI
cancellation, is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal
linear SI channel estimator significantly outperforms the conventional least

with strong SI and low oscillator quality.

<p class="mathjax">The analysis of mapping relationships and distortions in multidimensional
data poses a significant challenge in contemporary research. While Beltrami
coefficients offer a precise description of distortions in two-dimensional
mappings, current tools lack this capability in the context of
three-dimensional space. This paper presents a novel approach: a 3D
quasiconformal representation that captures the local dilation of 3D mappings,
along with an algorithm that establishes a connection between this
representation and the corresponding mapping. Experimental results showcase the
algorithm's effectiveness in eliminating foldings in 3D mappings, as well as in
mapping reconstruction and generation. These features bear a resemblance to the
2D Linear Beltrami Solver technique. The work presented in this paper offers a
promising solution for the precise analysis and adjustment of distortions in 3D
data and mappings.

<p class="mathjax">For safe vision-based control applications, perception-related constraints
have to be satisfied in addition to other state constraints. In this paper, we
deal with the problem where a multirotor equipped with a camera needs to
maintain the visibility of a point of interest while tracking a reference given
by a high-level planner. We devise a method based on reference governor that,
differently from existing solutions, is able to enforce control-level
visibility constraints with theoretically assured feasibility. To this end, we
design a new type of reference governor for linear systems with polynomial
constraints which is capable of handling time-varying references. The proposed
solution is implemented online for the real-time multirotor control with
visibility constraints and validated with simulations and an actual hardware
experiment.

<p class="mathjax">We describe a novel algorithm for solving general parametric (nonlinear)
eigenvalue problems. Our method has two steps: first, high-accuracy solutions
of non-parametric versions of the problem are gathered at some values of the
parameters; these are then combined to obtain global approximations of the
parametric eigenvalues. To gather the non-parametric data, we use non-intrusive
contour-integration-based methods, which, however, cannot track eigenvalues
that migrate into/out of the contour as the parameter changes. Special
strategies are described for performing the combination-over-parameter step
despite having only partial information on such "migrating" eigenvalues.
Moreover, we dedicate a special focus to the approximation of eigenvalues that
undergo bifurcations. Finally, we propose an adaptive strategy that allows one
to effectively apply our method even without any a priori information on the
behavior of the sought-after eigenvalues. Numerical tests are performed,
showing that our algorithm can achieve remarkably high approximation accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Informal language is a style of spoken or written language frequently used in
casual conversations, social media, weblogs, emails and text messages. In
informal writing, the language faces some lexical and/or syntactic changes
varying among different languages. Persian is one of the languages with many
differences between its formal and informal styles of writing, thus developing
informal language processing tools for this language seems necessary. Such a
converter needs a large aligned parallel corpus of colloquial-formal sentences
which can be useful for linguists to extract a regulated grammar and
orthography for colloquial Persian as is done for the formal language. In this
paper we explain our methodology in building a parallel corpus of 50,000
sentence pairs with alignments in the word/phrase level. The sentences were
attempted to cover almost all kinds of lexical and syntactic changes between
informal and formal Persian, therefore both methods of exploring and collecting
from the different resources of informal scripts and following the phonological
and morphological patterns of changes were applied to find as much instances as
possible. The resulting corpus has about 530,000 alignments and a dictionary
containing 49,397 word and phrase pairs.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel method for transmitting video data over noisy
wireless channels with high efficiency and controllability. The method
derivates from model division multiple access (MDMA) to extract common semantic
features from video frames. It also uses deep joint source-channel coding
(JSCC) as the main framework to establish communication links and deal with
channel noise. An entropy-based variable length coding scheme is developed to
adjust the data amount accurately and explicitly. We name our method as model
division video semantic communication (MDVSC). The main steps of our approach
are as follows: first, video frames are transformed into a latent space to
reduce computational complexity and redistribute data. Then, common features
and individual features are extracted, and variable length coding is applied to
further eliminate redundant semantic information under the communication
bandwidth constraint. We evaluate our method on standard video test sequences
and compare it with traditional wireless video coding methods. The results show
that MDVSC generally surpasses the conventional methods in terms of quality
metrics and has the capability to control code length precisely. Moreover,
additional experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate its
potential for various tasks.

student or an AI? In our work, we explore traditional and new features to (1)
detect text generated by AI from scratch and (2) text rephrased by AI. Since we
found that classification is more difficult when the AI has been instructed to
create the text in a way that a human would not recognize that it was generated
by an AI, we also investigate this more advanced case. For our experiments, we
produced a new text corpus covering 10 school topics. Our best systems to
classify basic and advanced human-generated/AI-generated texts have F1-scores
of over 96%. Our best systems for classifying basic and advanced
human-generated/AI-rephrased texts have F1-scores of more than 78%. The systems
use a combination of perplexity, semantic, list lookup, error-based,
readability, AI feedback, and text vector features. Our results show that the
new features substantially help to improve the performance of many classifiers.
Our best basic text rephrasing detection system even outperforms GPTZero by

<p class="mathjax">In Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been consistent advancements in
task-specific performance, largely influenced by effective prompt design. While
recent research on prompting has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, a
gap remains in further improving their understanding abilities. In this study,
we introduce metacognitive prompting (MP), a strategy inspired by human
introspective reasoning processes. Using MP, LLMs undergo a systematic series
of structured, self-aware evaluations, drawing on both their vast inherent
knowledge and new insights. Our experiments involve five prevalent LLMs:
Llama2, Vicuna, PaLM, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, all of which span various general
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE
benchmarks. Results indicate that, although GPT-4 consistently excels in most
tasks, PaLM, when equipped with MP, approaches its performance level.
Furthermore, across models and datasets, MP consistently outperforms existing
prompting methods, including standard and chain-of-thought prompting. This
study underscores the potential to amplify the understanding abilities of LLMs
and highlights the benefits of mirroring human introspective reasoning in NLU
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Prostate cancer (PC) MRI-based risk calculators are commonly
based on biological (e.g. PSA), MRI markers (e.g. volume), and patient age.
Whilst patient age measures the amount of years an individual has existed,
biological age (BA) might better reflect the physiology of an individual.
However, surrogates from prostate MRI and linkage with clinically significant
PC (csPC) remain to be explored. Purpose: To obtain and evaluate Prostate Age
Gap (PAG) as an MRI marker tool for csPC risk. Study type: Retrospective.
Population: A total of 7243 prostate MRI slices from 468 participants who had
undergone prostate biopsies. A deep learning model was trained on 3223 MRI
slices cropped around the gland from 81 low-grade PC (ncsPC, Gleason score &lt;=6)
and 131 negative cases and tested on the remaining 256 participants.
Assessment: Chronological age was defined as the age of the participant at the
time of the visit and used to train the deep learning model to predict the age
of the patient. Following, we obtained PAG, defined as the model predicted age
minus the patient's chronological age. Multivariate logistic regression models
were used to estimate the association through odds ratio (OR) and predictive
value of PAG and compared against PSA levels and PI-RADS&gt;=3. Statistical tests:
T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Permutation test and ROC curve analysis. Results:
The multivariate adjusted model showed a significant difference in the odds of
clinically significant PC (csPC, Gleason score &gt;=7) (OR =3.78, 95% confidence
interval (CI):2.32-6.16, P &lt;.001). PAG showed a better predictive ability when
compared to PI-RADS&gt;=3 and adjusted by other risk factors, including PSA
levels: AUC =0.981 vs AUC =0.704, p&lt;.001. Conclusion: PAG was significantly
associated with the risk of clinically significant PC and outperformed other
well-established PC risk factors.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT,
researchers start to explore the adoption of LLMs for agile hardware design,
such as generating design RTL based on natural-language instructions. However,
in existing works, their target designs are all relatively simple and in a
small scale, and proposed by the authors themselves, making a fair comparison
among different LLM solutions challenging. In addition, many prior works only
focus on the design correctness, without evaluating the design qualities of
generated design RTL. In this work, we propose an open-source benchmark named
RTLLM, for generating design RTL with natural language instructions. To
systematically evaluate the auto-generated design RTL, we summarized three
progressive goals, named syntax goal, functionality goal, and design quality
goal. This benchmark can automatically provide a quantitative evaluation of any
given LLM-based solution. Furthermore, we propose an easy-to-use yet
surprisingly effective prompt engineering technique named self-planning, which
proves to significantly boost the performance of GPT-3.5 in our proposed
benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">As a common natural weather condition, rain can obscure video frames and thus
affect the performance of the visual system, so video derain receives a lot of
attention. In natural environments, rain has a wide variety of streak types,
which increases the difficulty of the rain removal task. In this paper, we
propose a Rain Review-based General video derain Network via knowledge
distillation (named RRGNet) that handles different rain streak types with one
pre-training weight. Specifically, we design a frame grouping-based
encoder-decoder network that makes full use of the temporal information of the
video. Further, we use the old task model to guide the current model in
learning new rain streak types while avoiding forgetting. To consolidate the
network's ability to derain, we design a rain review module to play back data
from old tasks for the current model. The experimental results show that our
developed general method achieves the best results in terms of running speed
and derain effect.

<p class="mathjax">Current gaze input methods for VR headsets predominantly utilize the gaze ray
as a pointing cursor, often neglecting depth information in it. This study
introduces FocusFlow, a novel gaze interaction technique that integrates focal
depth into gaze input dimensions, facilitating users to actively shift their
focus along the depth dimension for interaction. A detection algorithm to
identify the user's focal depth is developed. Based on this, a layer-based UI
is proposed, which uses focal depth changes to enable layer switch operations,
offering an intuitive hands-free selection method. We also designed visual cues
to guide users to adjust focal depth accurately and get familiar with the
interaction process. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate the system's
usability, and several potential applications are discussed. Through FocusFlow,
we aim to enrich the input dimensions of gaze interaction, achieving more
intuitive and efficient human-computer interactions on headset devices.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called Preferential Attachment
k-class Classifier (PreAttacK) for detecting fake accounts in a social network.
Recently, several algorithms have obtained high accuracy on this problem.
However, they have done so by relying on information about fake accounts'
friendships or the content they share with others--the very things we seek to
prevent. PreAttacK represents a significant departure from these approaches. We
provide some of the first detailed distributional analyses of how new fake (and
real) accounts first attempt to request friends after joining a major network
(Facebook). We show that even before a new account has made friends or shared
content, these initial friend request behaviors evoke a natural multi-class
extension of the canonical Preferential Attachment model of social network
growth. We use this model to derive a new algorithm, PreAttacK. We prove that
in relevant problem instances, PreAttacK near-optimally approximates the
posterior probability that a new account is fake under this multi-class
Preferential Attachment model of new accounts' (not-yet-answered) friend
requests. These are the first provable guarantees for fake account detection
that apply to new users, and that do not require strong homophily assumptions.
This principled approach also makes PreAttacK the only algorithm with provable
guarantees that obtains state-of-the-art performance on new users on the global
Facebook network, where it converges to AUC=0.9 after new users send + receive
a total of just 20 not-yet-answered friend requests. For comparison,
state-of-the-art benchmarks do not obtain this AUC even after observing
additional data on new users' first 100 friend requests. Thus, unlike
mainstream algorithms, PreAttacK converges before the median new fake account
has made a single friendship (accepted friend request) with a human.

<p class="mathjax">In implant prosthesis treatment, the surgical guide of implant is used to
ensure accurate implantation. However, such design heavily relies on the manual
location of the implant position. When deep neural network has been proposed to
assist the dentist in locating the implant position, most of them take a single
slice as input, which do not fully explore 3D contextual information and
ignoring the influence of implant slope. In this paper, we design a Text Guided
3D Context and Slope Aware Triple Network (TCSloT) which enables the perception
of contextual information from multiple adjacent slices and awareness of
variation of implant slopes. A Texture Variation Perception (TVP) module is
correspondingly elaborated to process the multiple slices and capture the
texture variation among slices and a Slope-Aware Loss (SAL) is proposed to
dynamically assign varying weights for the regression head. Additionally, we
design a conditional text guidance (CTG) module to integrate the text condition
(i.e., left, middle and right) from the CLIP for assisting the implant position
prediction. Extensive experiments on a dental implant dataset through five-fold
cross-validation demonstrated that the proposed TCSloT achieves superior
performance than existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">The diversity of building architecture styles of global cities situated on
various landforms, the degraded optical imagery affected by clouds and shadows,
and the significant inter-class imbalance of roof types pose challenges for
designing a robust and accurate building roof instance segmentor. To address
these issues, we propose an effective framework to fulfill semantic
interpretation of individual buildings with high-resolution optical satellite
imagery. Specifically, the leveraged domain adapted pretraining strategy and
composite dual-backbone greatly facilitates the discriminative feature
learning. Moreover, new data augmentation pipeline, stochastic weight averaging
(SWA) training and instance segmentation based model ensemble in testing are
utilized to acquire additional performance boost. Experiment results show that
our approach ranks in the first place of the 2023 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
(DFC) Track 1 test phase ($mAP_{50}$:50.6\%). Note-worthily, we have also
explored the potential of multimodal data fusion with both optical satellite
imagery and SAR data.

<p class="mathjax">Pseudo-labeling is significant for semi-supervised instance segmentation,
which generates instance masks and classes from unannotated images for
subsequent training. However, in existing pipelines, pseudo-labels that contain
valuable information may be directly filtered out due to mismatches in class
and mask quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, called
pseudo-label aligning instance segmentation (PAIS), in this paper. In PAIS, we
devise a dynamic aligning loss (DALoss) that adjusts the weights of
semi-supervised loss terms with varying class and mask score pairs. Through
extensive experiments conducted on the COCO and Cityscapes datasets, we
demonstrate that PAIS is a promising framework for semi-supervised instance
segmentation, particularly in cases where labeled data is severely limited.
Notably, with just 1\% labeled data, PAIS achieves 21.2 mAP (based on
Mask-RCNN) and 19.9 mAP (based on K-Net) on the COCO dataset, outperforming the
current state-of-the-art model, \ie, NoisyBoundary with 7.7 mAP, by a margin of
over 12 points. Code is available at: \url{https://github.com/hujiecpp/PAIS}.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance in various
risk detection applications. They explore rich semantic representations and are
supposed to automatically discover risk behaviors. However, due to the lack of
transparency, the behavioral semantics cannot be conveyed to downstream
security experts to reduce their heavy workload in security analysis. Although
feature attribution (FA) methods can be used to explain deep learning, the
underlying classifier is still blind to what behavior is suspicious, and the
generated explanation cannot adapt to downstream tasks, incurring poor
explanation fidelity and intelligibility. In this paper, we propose FINER, the
first framework for risk detection classifiers to generate high-fidelity and
high-intelligibility explanations. The high-level idea is to gather explanation
efforts from model developer, FA designer, and security experts. To improve
fidelity, we fine-tune the classifier with an explanation-guided multi-task
learning strategy. To improve intelligibility, we engage task knowledge to
adjust and ensemble FA methods. Extensive evaluations show that FINER improves
explanation quality for risk detection. Moreover, we demonstrate that FINER
outperforms a state-of-the-art tool in facilitating malware analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient and timely calculations of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are
essential for emerging technologies like autonomous driving, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and edge computing. One of the primary ML algorithms used in such
systems is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which demand high
computational resources. This requirement has led to the use of ML accelerators
like GPGPUs to meet design constraints. However, selecting the most suitable
accelerator involves Design Space Exploration (DSE), a process that is usually
time-consuming and requires significant manual effort. Our work presents
approaches to expedite the DSE process by identifying the most appropriate
GPGPU for CNN inferencing systems. We have developed a quick and precise
technique for forecasting the power and performance of CNNs during inference,
with a MAPE of 5.03% and 5.94%, respectively. Our approach empowers computer
architects to estimate power and performance in the early stages of
development, reducing the necessity for numerous prototypes. This saves time
and money while also improving the time-to-market period.

<p class="mathjax">Co-movement pattern mining from GPS trajectories has been an intriguing
subject in spatial-temporal data mining. In this paper, we extend this research
line by migrating the data source from GPS sensors to surveillance cameras, and
presenting the first investigation into co-movement pattern mining from videos.
We formulate the new problem, re-define the spatial-temporal proximity
constraints from cameras deployed in a road network, and theoretically prove
its hardness. Due to the lack of readily applicable solutions, we adapt
existing techniques and propose two competitive baselines using Apriori-based
enumerator and CMC algorithm, respectively.
<br />As the principal technical contributions, we introduce a novel index called
temporal-cluster suffix tree (TCS-tree), which performs two-level temporal
clustering within each camera and constructs a suffix tree from the resulting
clusters. Moreover, we present a sequence-ahead pruning framework based on
TCS-tree, which allows for the simultaneous leverage of all pattern constraints
to filter candidate paths. Finally, to reduce verification cost on the
candidate paths, we propose a sliding-window based co-movement pattern
enumeration strategy and a hashing-based dominance eliminator, both of which
are effective in avoiding redundant operations.
<br />We conduct extensive experiments for scalability and effectiveness analysis.
Our results validate the efficiency of the proposed index and mining algorithm,
which runs remarkably faster than the two baseline methods. Additionally, we
construct a video database with 1169 cameras and perform an end-to-end pipeline
analysis to study the performance gap between GPS-driven and video-driven
methods. Our results demonstrate that the derived patterns from the
video-driven approach are similar to those derived from groundtruth
trajectories, providing evidence of its effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">This work considers gradient-based mesh optimization, where we iteratively
optimize for a 3D surface mesh by representing it as the isosurface of a scalar
field, an increasingly common paradigm in applications including
photogrammetry, generative modeling, and inverse physics. Existing
implementations adapt classic isosurface extraction algorithms like Marching
Cubes or Dual Contouring; these techniques were designed to extract meshes from
fixed, known fields, and in the optimization setting they lack the degrees of
freedom to represent high-quality feature-preserving meshes, or suffer from
numerical instabilities. We introduce FlexiCubes, an isosurface representation
specifically designed for optimizing an unknown mesh with respect to geometric,
visual, or even physical objectives. Our main insight is to introduce
additional carefully-chosen parameters into the representation, which allow
local flexible adjustments to the extracted mesh geometry and connectivity.
These parameters are updated along with the underlying scalar field via
automatic differentiation when optimizing for a downstream task. We base our
extraction scheme on Dual Marching Cubes for improved topological properties,
and present extensions to optionally generate tetrahedral and
hierarchically-adaptive meshes. Extensive experiments validate FlexiCubes on
both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, showing that it offers
significant improvements in mesh quality and geometric fidelity.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with
human intentions [1,2], has become a critical task before deploying large
language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. For instance, OpenAI devoted
six months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a
major challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on
evaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and
regulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs.
To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key
dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The
survey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability,
safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence
to social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into
several sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories.
Additionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further
investigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and
conducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that,
in general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall
trustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the
different trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance
of conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous
improvements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM
trustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to
practitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be
crucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Relevance modeling aims to locate desirable items for corresponding queries,
which is crucial for search engines to ensure user experience. Although most
conventional approaches address this problem by assessing the semantic
similarity between the query and item, pure semantic matching is not
everything. In reality, auxiliary query-item interactions extracted from user
historical behavior data of the search log could provide hints to reveal users'
search intents further. Drawing inspiration from this, we devise a novel
Behavior Augmented Relevance Learning model for Alipay Search (BARL-ASe) that
leverages neighbor queries of target item and neighbor items of target query to
complement target query-item semantic matching. Specifically, our model builds
multi-level co-attention for distilling coarse-grained and fine-grained
semantic representations from both neighbor and target views. The model
subsequently employs neighbor-target self-supervised learning to improve the
accuracy and robustness of BARL-ASe by strengthening representation and logit
learning. Furthermore, we discuss how to deal with the long-tail query-item
matching of the mini apps search scenario of Alipay practically. Experiments on
real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal
achieves promising performance with low latency.

and impactful software systems, but the software development process of
real-world production systems from prototyped ML models remains challenging
with additional complexity and interdisciplinary collaboration challenges. This
poses difficulties in using traditional software lifecycle models such as
waterfall, spiral or agile model when building ML-enabled systems. By
interviewing with practitioners from multiple companies, we investigated the
application of using systems engineering process in ML-enabled systems. We
developed a set of propositions and proposed V4ML process model for building

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes joint attention estimation in a single image. Different
from related work in which only the gaze-related attributes of people are
independently employed, (I) their locations and actions are also employed as
contextual cues for weighting their attributes, and (ii) interactions among all
of these attributes are explicitly modeled in our method. For the interaction
modeling, we propose a novel Transformer-based attention network to encode
joint attention as low-dimensional features. We introduce a specialized MLP
head with positional embedding to the Transformer so that it predicts pixelwise
confidence of joint attention for generating the confidence heatmap. This
pixelwise prediction improves the heatmap accuracy by avoiding the ill-posed
problem in which the high-dimensional heatmap is predicted from the
low-dimensional features. The estimated joint attention is further improved by
being integrated with general image-based attention estimation. Our method
outperforms SOTA methods quantitatively in comparative experiments. Code:

<p class="mathjax">Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have emerged as a transformative force in
the realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), demonstrating their
versatility and efficacy across a variety of applications. The ability to model
complex data distributions and generate high-quality samples has made GDMs
particularly effective in tasks such as image generation and reinforcement
learning. Furthermore, their iterative nature, which involves a series of noise
addition and denoising steps, is a powerful and unique approach to learning and
generating data. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on applying GDMs
in network optimization tasks. We delve into the strengths of GDMs, emphasizing
their wide applicability across various domains, such as vision, text, and
audio generation.We detail how GDMs can be effectively harnessed to solve
complex optimization problems inherent in networks. The paper first provides a
basic background of GDMs and their applications in network optimization. This
is followed by a series of case studies, showcasing the integration of GDMs
with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), incentive mechanism design, Semantic
Communications (SemCom), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, etc. These case
studies underscore the practicality and efficacy of GDMs in real-world
scenarios, offering insights into network design. We conclude with a discussion
on potential future directions for GDM research and applications, providing
major insights into how they can continue to shape the future of network
optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Patent classification aims to assign multiple International Patent
Classification (IPC) codes to a given patent. Recent methods for automatically
classifying patents mainly focus on analyzing the text descriptions of patents.
However, apart from the texts, each patent is also associated with some
assignees, and the knowledge of their applied patents is often valuable for
classification. Furthermore, the hierarchical taxonomy formulated by the IPC
system provides important contextual information and enables models to leverage
the correlations between IPC codes for more accurate classification. However,
existing methods fail to incorporate the above aspects. In this paper, we
propose an integrated framework that comprehensively considers the information
on patents for patent classification. To be specific, we first present an IPC
codes correlations learning module to derive their semantic representations via
adaptively passing and aggregating messages within the same level and across
different levels along the hierarchical taxonomy. Moreover, we design a
historical application patterns learning component to incorporate the
corresponding assignee's previous patents by a dual channel aggregation
mechanism. Finally, we combine the contextual information of patent texts that
contains the semantics of IPC codes, and assignees' sequential preferences to
make predictions. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our approach over the existing methods. Besides, we present the
model's ability to capture the temporal patterns of assignees and the semantic
dependencies among IPC codes.

<p class="mathjax">In a fashion e-commerce platform where customers can't physically examine the
products on their own, being able to see other customers' text and image
reviews of the product is critical while making purchase decisions. Given the
high reliance on these reviews, over the years we have observed customers
proactively sharing their reviews. With an increase in the coverage of User
Generated Content (UGC), there has been a corresponding increase in the number
of customer images. It is thus imperative to display the most relevant images
on top as it may influence users' online shopping choices and behavior. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet effective training procedure for ranking
customer images. We created a dataset consisting of Myntra (A Major Indian
Fashion e-commerce company) studio posts and highly engaged (upvotes/downvotes)
UGC images as our starting point and used selected distortion techniques on the
images of the above dataset to bring their quality at par with those of bad UGC
images. We train our network to rank bad-quality images lower than high-quality
ones. Our proposed method outperforms the baseline models on two metrics,
namely correlation coefficient, and accuracy, by substantial margins.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is an essential component of modern Augmented
Reality (AR) applications. However, VIO only tracks the relative pose of the
device, leading to drift over time. Absolute pose estimation methods infer the
device's absolute pose, but their accuracy depends on the input quality. This
paper introduces VIO-APR, a new framework for markerless mobile AR that
combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system.
VIO-APR uses VIO to assess the reliability of the APR and the APR to identify
and compensate for VIO drift. This feedback loop results in more accurate
positioning and more stable AR experiences. To evaluate VIO-APR, we created a
dataset that combines camera images with ARKit's VIO system output for six
indoor and outdoor scenes of various scales. Over this dataset, VIO-APR
improves the median accuracy of popular APR by up to 36\% in position and 29\%
in orientation, increases the percentage of frames in the high ($0.25 m,
2^{\circ}$) accuracy level by up to 112\% and reduces the percentage of frames
predicted below the low ($5 m, 10^\circ$) accuracy greatly. We implement
VIO-APR into a mobile AR application using Unity to demonstrate its
capabilities. VIO-APR results in noticeably more accurate localization and a
more stable overall experience.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting and using class-discriminative features is critical for
fine-grained recognition. Existing works have demonstrated the possibility of
applying deep CNNs to exploit features that distinguish similar classes.
However, CNNs suffer from problems including frequency bias and loss of
detailed local information, which restricts the performance of recognizing
fine-grained categories. To address the challenge, we propose a novel texture
branch as complimentary to the CNN branch for feature extraction. We
innovatively utilize Gabor filters as a powerful extractor to exploit texture
features, motivated by the capability of Gabor filters in effectively capturing
multi-frequency features and detailed local information. We implement several
designs to enhance the effectiveness of Gabor filters, including imposing
constraints on parameter values and developing a learning method to determine
the optimal parameters. Moreover, we introduce a statistical feature extractor
to utilize informative statistical information from the signals captured by
Gabor filters, and a gate selection mechanism to enable efficient computation
by only considering qualified regions as input for texture extraction. Through
the integration of features from the Gabor-filter-based texture branch and
CNN-based semantic branch, we achieve comprehensive information extraction. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple datasets, including
CUB-200-2011, NA-bird, Stanford Dogs, and GTOS-mobile. State-of-the-art
performance is achieved using our approach.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel and interpretable end-to-end learning framework,
called the deep compensation unfolding network (DCUNet), for restoring light
field (LF) images captured under low-light conditions. DCUNet is designed with
a multi-stage architecture that mimics the optimization process of solving an
inverse imaging problem in a data-driven fashion. The framework uses the
intermediate enhanced result to estimate the illumination map, which is then
employed in the unfolding process to produce a new enhanced result.
Additionally, DCUNet includes a content-associated deep compensation module at
each optimization stage to suppress noise and illumination map estimation
errors. To properly mine and leverage the unique characteristics of LF images,
this paper proposes a pseudo-explicit feature interaction module that
comprehensively exploits redundant information in LF images. The experimental
results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
DCUNet over state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Moreover, DCUNet preserves the essential geometric structure of enhanced LF
images much better. The code will be publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">With a rapidly increasing amount and diversity of remote sensing (RS) data
sources, there is a strong need for multi-view learning modeling. This is a
complex task when considering the differences in resolution, magnitude, and
noise of RS data. The typical approach for merging multiple RS sources has been
input-level fusion, but other - more advanced - fusion strategies may
outperform this traditional approach. This work assesses different fusion
strategies for crop classification in the CropHarvest dataset. The fusion
methods proposed in this work outperform models based on individual views and
previous fusion methods. We do not find one single fusion method that
consistently outperforms all other approaches. Instead, we present a comparison
of multi-view fusion methods for three different datasets and show that,
depending on the test region, different methods obtain the best performance.
Despite this, we suggest a preliminary criterion for the selection of fusion
methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a new method to infer keypoints from arbitrary object
categories in practical scenarios where point cloud data (PCD) are noisy,
down-sampled and arbitrarily rotated. Our proposed model adheres to the
following principles: i) keypoints inference is fully unsupervised (no
annotation given), ii) keypoints position error should be low and resilient to
PCD perturbations (robustness), iii) keypoints should not change their indexes
for the intra-class objects (semantic coherence), iv) keypoints should be close
to or proximal to PCD surface (compactness). We achieve these desiderata by
proposing a new self-supervised training strategy for keypoints estimation that
does not assume any a priori knowledge of the object class, and a model
architecture with coupled auxiliary losses that promotes the desired keypoints
properties. We compare the keypoints estimated by the proposed approach with
those of the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. The experiments show
that our approach outperforms by estimating keypoints with improved coverage
(+9.41%) while being semantically consistent (+4.66%) that best characterizes
the object's 3D shape for downstream tasks. Code and data are available at:

emerging applications in medical imaging, patient care, and other areas. While
these applications have proven successful in retrospective studies, very few of
them were applied in practice.The field of Medical AI faces various challenges,
in terms of building user trust, complying with regulations, using data
ethically.Explainable AI (XAI) aims to enable humans understand AI and trust
its results. This paper presents a literature review on the recent developments
of XAI solutions for medical decision support, based on a representative sample
of 198 articles published in recent years. The systematic synthesis of the
relevant articles resulted in several findings. (1) model-agnostic XAI
techniques were mostly employed in these solutions, (2) deep learning models
are utilized more than other types of machine learning models, (3)
explainability was applied to promote trust, but very few works reported the
physicians participation in the loop, (4) visual and interactive user interface
is more useful in understanding the explanation and the recommendation of the
system. More research is needed in collaboration between medical and AI
experts, that could guide the development of suitable frameworks for the
design, implementation, and evaluation of XAI solutions in medicine.

<p class="mathjax">Thanks to HTML5, users can now view videos on Web browsers without installing
plug-ins or relying on specific devices. In 2017, W3C published Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME) as the first official Web standard for Digital Rights
Management (DRM), with the overarching goal of allowing seamless integration of
DRM systems on browsers. EME has prompted numerous voices of dissent with
respect to the inadequate protection of users. Of particular interest, privacy
concerns were articulated, especially that DRM systems inherently require
uniquely identifying information on users' devices to control content
distribution better. Despite this anecdotal evidence, we lack a comprehensive
overview of how browsers have supported EME in practice and what privacy
implications are caused by their implementations. In this paper, we fill this
gap by investigating privacy leakage caused by EME relying on proprietary and
closed-source DRM systems. We focus on Google Widevine because of its
versatility and wide adoption. We conduct empirical experiments to show that
browsers diverge when complying EME privacy guidelines, which might undermine
users' privacy. For instance, we find that many browsers gladly give away the
identifying Widevine Client ID with no or little explicit consent from users.
Moreover, we characterize the privacy risks of users tracking when browsers
miss applying EME guidelines regarding privacy. Because of being closed-source,
our work involves reverse engineering to dissect the contents of EME messages
as instantiated by Widevine. Finally, we implement EME Track, a tool that
automatically exploits bad Widevine-based implementations to break privacy.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task aims to answer questions about
different visual objects, sounds, and their associations in videos. Such
naturally multi-modal videos are composed of rich and complex dynamic
audio-visual components, where most of which could be unrelated to the given
questions, or even play as interference in answering the content of interest.
Oppositely, only focusing on the question-aware audio-visual content could get
rid of influence, meanwhile enabling the model to answer more efficiently. In
this paper, we propose a Progressive Spatio-Temporal Perception Network
(PSTP-Net), which contains three modules that progressively identify key
spatio-temporal regions w.r.t. questions. Specifically, a temporal segment
selection module is first introduced to select the most relevant audio-visual
segments related to the given question. Then, a spatial region selection module
is utilized to choose the most relevant regions associated with the question
from the selected temporal segments. To further refine the selection of
features, an audio-guided visual attention module is employed to perceive the
association between auido and selected spatial regions. Finally, the
spatio-temporal features from these modules are integrated for answering the
question. Extensive experimental results on the public MUSIC-AVQA and AVQA
datasets provide compelling evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of
PSTP-Net. Code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Physics Informed Neural Networks is a numerical method which uses neural
networks to approximate solutions of partial differential equations. It has
received a lot of attention and is currently used in numerous physical and
engineering problems. The mathematical understanding of these methods is
limited, and in particular, it seems that, a consistent notion of stability is
missing. Towards addressing this issue we consider model problems of partial
differential equations, namely linear elliptic and parabolic PDEs. We consider
problems with different stability properties, and problems with time discrete
training. Motivated by tools of nonlinear calculus of variations we
systematically show that coercivity of the energies and associated compactness
provide the right framework for stability. For time discrete training we show
that if these properties fail to hold then methods may become unstable.
Furthermore, using tools of $\Gamma-$convergence we provide new convergence
results for weak solutions by only requiring that the neural network spaces are
chosen to have suitable approximation properties.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, Meta's LLaMA, and
Google's PaLM2, have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. A
notable paradigm shift has been the advent of the Segment Anything Model (SAM),
which has exhibited a remarkable capability to segment real-world objects,
trained on 1 billion masks and 11 million images. Although SAM excels in
general object segmentation, it lacks the intrinsic ability to detect salient
objects, resulting in suboptimal performance in this domain. To address this
challenge, we present the Segment Salient Object Model (SSOM), an innovative
approach that adaptively fine-tunes SAM for salient object detection by
harnessing the low-rank structure inherent in deep learning. Comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations across five challenging RGB benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Speech-driven 3D face animation poses significant challenges due to the
intricacy and variability inherent in human facial movements. This paper
emphasizes the importance of considering both the composite and regional
natures of facial movements in speech-driven 3D face animation. The composite
nature pertains to how speech-independent factors globally modulate
speech-driven facial movements along the temporal dimension. Meanwhile, the
regional nature alludes to the notion that facial movements are not globally
correlated but are actuated by local musculature along the spatial dimension.
It is thus indispensable to incorporate both natures for engendering vivid
animation. To address the composite nature, we introduce an adaptive modulation
module that employs arbitrary facial movements to dynamically adjust
speech-driven facial movements across frames on a global scale. To accommodate
the regional nature, our approach ensures that each constituent of the facial
features for every frame focuses on the local spatial movements of 3D faces.
Moreover, we present a non-autoregressive backbone for translating audio to 3D
facial movements, which maintains high-frequency nuances of facial movements
and facilitates efficient inference. Comprehensive experiments and user studies
demonstrate that our method surpasses contemporary state-of-the-art approaches
both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose an ensemble modeling approach for multimodal action
recognition. We independently train individual modality models using a variant
of focal loss tailored to handle the long-tailed distribution of the MECCANO
[21] dataset. Based on the underlying principle of focal loss, which captures
the relationship between tail (scarce) classes and their prediction
difficulties, we propose an exponentially decaying variant of focal loss for
our current task. It initially emphasizes learning from the hard misclassified
examples and gradually adapts to the entire range of examples in the dataset.
This annealing process encourages the model to strike a balance between
focusing on the sparse set of hard samples, while still leveraging the
information provided by the easier ones. Additionally, we opt for the late
fusion strategy to combine the resultant probability distributions from RGB and
Depth modalities for final action prediction. Experimental evaluations on the
MECCANO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">One critical challenge in 6D object pose estimation from a single RGBD image
is efficient integration of two different modalities, i.e., color and depth. In
this work, we tackle this problem by a novel Deep Fusion Transformer~(DFTr)
block that can aggregate cross-modality features for improving pose estimation.
Unlike existing fusion methods, the proposed DFTr can better model
cross-modality semantic correlation by leveraging their semantic similarity,
such that globally enhanced features from different modalities can be better
integrated for improved information extraction. Moreover, to further improve
robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel weighted vector-wise voting
algorithm that employs a non-iterative global optimization strategy for precise
3D keypoint localization while achieving near real-time inference. Extensive
experiments show the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of our
proposed 3D keypoint voting algorithm. Results on four widely used benchmarks
also demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by
large margins.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an experimental method for measuring bias in face recognition
systems. Existing methods to measure bias depend on benchmark datasets that are
collected in the wild and annotated for protected (e.g., race, gender) and
non-protected (e.g., pose, lighting) attributes. Such observational datasets
only permit correlational conclusions, e.g., "Algorithm A's accuracy is
different on female and male faces in dataset X.". By contrast, experimental
methods manipulate attributes individually and thus permit causal conclusions,
e.g., "Algorithm A's accuracy is affected by gender and skin color."
<br />Our method is based on generating synthetic faces using a neural face
generator, where each attribute of interest is modified independently while
leaving all other attributes constant. Human observers crucially provide the
ground truth on perceptual identity similarity between synthetic image pairs.
We validate our method quantitatively by evaluating race and gender biases of
three research-grade face recognition models. Our synthetic pipeline reveals
that for these algorithms, accuracy is lower for Black and East Asian
population subgroups. Our method can also quantify how perceptual changes in
attributes affect face identity distances reported by these models. Our large
synthetic dataset, consisting of 48,000 synthetic face image pairs (10,200
unique synthetic faces) and 555,000 human annotations (individual attributes
and pairwise identity comparisons) is available to researchers in this
important area.

<p class="mathjax">Several studies rely on the de facto standard Adaptive Monte Carlo
Localization (AMCL) method to localize a robot in an Occupancy Grid Map (OGM)
extracted from a building information model (BIM model). However, most of these
studies assume that the BIM model precisely represents the real world, which is
rarely true. Discrepancies between the reference BIM model and the real world
(Scan-BIM deviations) are not only due to furniture or clutter but also the
usual as-planned and as-built deviations that exist with any model created in
the design phase. These deviations affect the accuracy of AMCL drastically.
This paper proposes an open-source method to generate appropriate Pose
Graph-based maps from BIM models for robust 2D-LiDAR localization in changing
and dynamic environments. First, 2D OGMs are automatically generated from
complex BIM models. These OGMs only represent structural elements allowing
indoor autonomous robot navigation. Then, an efficient technique converts these
2D OGMs into Pose Graph-based maps enabling more accurate robot pose tracking.
Finally, we leverage the different map representations for accurate, robust
localization with a combination of state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, we
provide a quantitative comparison of various state-of-the-art localization
algorithms in three simulated scenarios with varying levels of Scan-BIM
deviations and dynamic agents. More precisely, we compare two Particle Filter
(PF) algorithms: AMCL and General Monte Carlo Localization (GMCL); and two
Graph-based Localization (GBL) methods: Google's Cartographer and SLAM Toolbox,
solving the global localization and pose tracking problems. The numerous
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method contributes to a robust
localization with an as-designed BIM model or a sparse OGM in changing and
dynamic environments, outperforming the conventional AMCL in accuracy and
robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Factor graphs are a very powerful graphical representation, used to model
many problems in robotics. They are widely spread in the areas of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM), computer vision, and localization. In this
paper we describe an approach to fill the gap with other areas, such as optimal
control, by presenting an extension of Factor Graph Solvers to constrained
optimization. The core idea of our method is to encapsulate the Augmented
Lagrangian (AL) method in factors of the graph that can be integrated
straightforwardly in existing factor graph solvers. We show the generality of
our approach by addressing three applications, arising from different areas:
pose estimation, rotation synchronization and Model Predictive Control (MPC) of
a pseudo-omnidirectional platform. We implemented our approach using C++ and
ROS. Besides the generality of the approach, application results show that we
can favorably compare against domain specific approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Age of information (AoI) is an effective performance metric measuring the
freshness of information and is particularly suitable for applications
involving status update. In this paper, using the age violation probability as
the metric, scheduling for heterogeneous multi-source systems is studied. Two
queueing disciplines, namely the infinite packet queueing discipline and the
single packet queueing discipline, are considered for scheduling packets within
each source. A generalized round-robin (GRR) scheduling policy is then proposed
to schedule the sources. Bounds on the exponential decay rate of the age
violation probability for the proposed GRR scheduling policy under each
queueing discipline are rigorously analyzed. Simulation results are provided,
which show that the proposed GRR scheduling policy can efficiently serve many
sources with heterogeneous arrivals and that our bounds can capture the true
decay rate quite accurately. When specialized to the homogeneous source
setting, the analysis concretizes the common belief that the single packet
queueing discipline has a better AoI performance than the infinite packet
queueing discipline. Moreover, simulations on this special case reveals that
under the proposed scheduling policy, the two disciplines would have similar
asymptotic performance when the inter-arrival time is much larger than the
total transmission time.

<p class="mathjax">Underwater images often suffer from color distortion and low contrast
resulting in various image types, due to the scattering and absorption of light
by water. While it is difficult to obtain high-quality paired training samples
with a generalized model. To tackle these challenges, we design a Generalized
Underwater image enhancement method via a Physical-knowledge-guided Dynamic
Model (short for GUPDM), consisting of three parts: Atmosphere-based Dynamic
Structure (ADS), Transmission-guided Dynamic Structure (TDS), and Prior-based
Multi-scale Structure (PMS). In particular, to cover complex underwater scenes,
this study changes the global atmosphere light and the transmission to simulate
various underwater image types (e.g., the underwater image color ranging from
yellow to blue) through the formation model. We then design ADS and TDS that
use dynamic convolutions to adaptively extract prior information from
underwater images and generate parameters for PMS. These two modules enable the
network to select appropriate parameters for various water types adaptively.
Besides, the multi-scale feature extraction module in PMS uses convolution
blocks with different kernel sizes and obtains weights for each feature map via
channel attention block and fuses them to boost the receptive field of the
network. The source code will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Markerless Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) aims to anchor digital content in
the physical world without using specific 2D or 3D objects. Absolute Pose
Regressors (APR) are end-to-end machine learning solutions that infer the
device's pose from a single monocular image. Thanks to their low computation
cost, they can be directly executed on the constrained hardware of mobile AR
devices. However, APR methods tend to yield significant inaccuracies for input
images that are too distant from the training set. This paper introduces
KS-APR, a pipeline that assesses the reliability of an estimated pose with
minimal overhead by combining the inference results of the APR and the prior
images in the training set. Mobile AR systems tend to rely upon visual-inertial
odometry to track the relative pose of the device during the experience. As
such, KS-APR favours reliability over frequency, discarding unreliable poses.
This pipeline can integrate most existing APR methods to improve accuracy by
filtering unreliable images with their pose estimates. We implement the
pipeline on three types of APR models on indoor and outdoor datasets. The
median error on position and orientation is reduced for all models, and the
proportion of large errors is minimized across datasets. Our method enables
state-of-the-art APRs such as DFNetdm to outperform single-image and sequential
APR methods. These results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of
KS-APR for visual localization tasks that do not require one-shot decisions.

<p class="mathjax">Node classification is the task of predicting the labels of unlabeled nodes
in a graph. State-of-the-art methods based on graph neural networks achieve
excellent performance when all labels are available during training. But in
real-life, models are often applied on data with new classes, which can lead to
massive misclassification and thus significantly degrade performance. Hence,
developing open-set classification methods is crucial to determine if a given
sample belongs to a known class. Existing methods for open-set node
classification generally use transductive learning with part or all of the
features of real unseen class nodes to help with open-set classification. In
this paper, we propose a novel generative open-set node classification method,
i.e. $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$, which follows a stricter inductive learning setting
where no information about unknown classes is available during training and
validation. Two kinds of proxy unknown nodes, inter-class unknown proxies and
external unknown proxies are generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the
distribution of novel classes. Using the generated proxies, a closed-set
classifier can be transformed into an open-set one, by augmenting it with an
extra proxy classifier. Under the constraints of both cross entropy loss and
complement entropy loss, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ achieves superior effectiveness for
unknown class detection and known class classification, which is validated by
experiments on benchmark graph datasets. Moreover, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ does not
have specific requirement on the GNN architecture and shows good
generalizations.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) under changing environment models many real-world
applications via nonstationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and hence
gains considerable interest. However, theoretical studies on nonstationary MDPs
in the literature have mainly focused on tabular and linear (mixture) MDPs,
which do not capture the nature of unknown representation in deep RL. In this
paper, we make the first effort to investigate nonstationary RL under episodic
low-rank MDPs, where both transition kernels and rewards may vary over time,
and the low-rank model contains unknown representation in addition to the
linear state embedding function. We first propose a parameter-dependent policy
optimization algorithm called PORTAL, and further improve PORTAL to its
parameter-free version of Ada-PORTAL, which is able to tune its
hyper-parameters adaptively without any prior knowledge of nonstationarity. For
both algorithms, we provide upper bounds on the average dynamic suboptimality
gap, which show that as long as the nonstationarity is not significantly large,
PORTAL and Ada-PORTAL are sample-efficient and can achieve arbitrarily small
average dynamic suboptimality gap with polynomial sample complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Deceptive text classification is a critical task in natural language
processing that aims to identify deceptive or fraudulent content. This study
presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and transformer-based
approaches for deceptive text classification. We investigate the effectiveness
of traditional machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art transformer
models, such as BERT, XLNET, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, in detecting deceptive
text. A labeled dataset consisting of deceptive and non-deceptive texts is used
for training and evaluation purposes. Through extensive experimentation, we
compare the performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score, of the different approaches. The results of this study shed light on the
strengths and limitations of machine learning and transformer-based methods for
deceptive text classification, enabling researchers and practitioners to make
informed decisions when dealing with deceptive content

<p class="mathjax">Recent developments and the beginning market introduction of high-resolution
imaging 4D (3+1D) radar sensors have initialized deep learning-based radar
perception research. We investigate deep learning-based models operating on
radar point clouds for 3D object detection. 3D object detection on lidar point
cloud data is a mature area of 3D vision. Many different architectures have
been proposed, each with strengths and weaknesses. Due to similarities between
3D lidar point clouds and 3+1D radar point clouds, those existing 3D object
detectors are a natural basis to start deep learning-based 3D object detection
on radar data. Thus, the first step is to analyze the detection performance of
the existing models on the new data modality and evaluate them in depth. In
order to apply existing 3D point cloud object detectors developed for lidar
point clouds to the radar domain, they need to be adapted first. While some
detectors, such as PointPillars, have already been adapted to be applicable to
radar data, we have adapted others, e.g., Voxel R-CNN, SECOND, PointRCNN, and
PV-RCNN. To this end, we conduct a cross-model validation (evaluating a set of
models on one particular data set) as well as a cross-data set validation
(evaluating all models in the model set on several data sets). The
high-resolution radar data used are the View-of-Delft and Astyx data sets.
Finally, we evaluate several adaptations of the models and their training
procedures. We also discuss major factors influencing the detection performance
on radar data and propose possible solutions indicating potential future
research avenues.

<p class="mathjax">We aim at providing the object detection community with an efficient and
performant object detector, termed YOLO-MS. The core design is based on a
series of investigations on how convolutions with different kernel sizes affect
the detection performance of objects at different scales. The outcome is a new
strategy that can strongly enhance multi-scale feature representations of
real-time object detectors. To verify the effectiveness of our strategy, we
build a network architecture, termed YOLO-MS. We train our YOLO-MS on the MS
COCO dataset from scratch without relying on any other large-scale datasets,
like ImageNet, or pre-trained weights. Without bells and whistles, our YOLO-MS
outperforms the recent state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including
YOLO-v7 and RTMDet, when using a comparable number of parameters and FLOPs.
Taking the XS version of YOLO-MS as an example, with only 4.5M learnable
parameters and 8.7G FLOPs, it can achieve an AP score of 43%+ on MS COCO, which
is about 2%+ higher than RTMDet with the same model size. Moreover, our work
can also be used as a plug-and-play module for other YOLO models. Typically,
our method significantly improves the AP of YOLOv8 from 37%+ to 40%+ with even
fewer parameters and FLOPs. Code is available at
https://github.com/FishAndWasabi/YOLO-MS.

and optimizing a database system to ensure data availability, performance, and
reliability. However, it is hard and tedious for DBAs to manage a large number
of database instances (e.g., millions of instances on the cloud databases).
Recently large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to understand
valuable documents and accordingly generate reasonable answers. Thus, we
propose D-Bot, a LLM-based database administrator that can continuously acquire
database maintenance experience from textual sources, and provide reasonable,
well-founded, in-time diagnosis and optimization advice for target databases.
This paper presents a revolutionary LLM-centric framework for database
maintenance, including (i) database maintenance knowledge detection from
documents and tools, (ii) tree of thought reasoning for root cause analysis,
and (iii) collaborative diagnosis among multiple LLMs. Our preliminary
experimental results that D-Bot can efficiently and effectively diagnose the

<p class="mathjax">Quality-Diversity (QD) methods are algorithms that aim to generate a set of
diverse and high-performing solutions to a given problem. Originally developed
for evolutionary robotics, most QD studies are conducted on a limited set of
domains - mainly applied to locomotion, where the fitness and the behavior
signal are dense. Grasping is a crucial task for manipulation in robotics.
Despite the efforts of many research communities, this task is yet to be
solved. Grasping cumulates unprecedented challenges in QD literature: it
suffers from reward sparsity, behavioral sparsity, and behavior space
misalignment. The present work studies how QD can address grasping. Experiments
have been conducted on 15 different methods on 10 grasping domains,
corresponding to 2 different robot-gripper setups and 5 standard objects. An
evaluation framework that distinguishes the evaluation of an algorithm from its
internal components has also been proposed for a fair comparison. The obtained
results show that MAP-Elites variants that select successful solutions in
priority outperform all the compared methods on the studied metrics by a large
margin. We also found experimental evidence that sparse interaction can lead to
deceptive novelty. To our knowledge, the ability to efficiently produce
examples of grasping trajectories demonstrated in this work has no precedent in
the literature.

<p class="mathjax">We describe a generic construction of non-wellfounded syntax involving
variable binding and its monadic substitution operation. Our construction of
the syntax and its substitution takes place in category theory, notably by
using monoidal categories and strong functors between them. A language is
specified by a multi-sorted binding signature, say {\Sigma}. First, we provide
sufficient criteria for {\Sigma} to generate a language of possibly infinite
terms, through {\omega}-continuity. Second, we construct a monadic substitution
operation for the language generated by {\Sigma}. A cornerstone in this
construction is a mild generalization of the notion of heterogeneous
substitution systems developed by Matthes and Uustalu; such a system
encapsulates the necessary corecursion scheme for implementing substitution.
The results are formalized in the Coq proof assistant, through the UniMath
library of univalent mathematics.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown a surprising level of performance on
multiple software engineering problems. However, they have not yet been applied
to fault localization (FL), in which one must find the code element responsible
for a bug from a potentially vast software repository. Nonetheless, LLM
application to FL has the potential to benefit developers both in terms of
performance and explainability. In this work, we present AutoFL, an automated
fault localization technique that only requires a single failing test, and in
its fault localization process generates an explanation about why the given
test fails. Using the function call API of the ChatGPT large language model, we
provide tools that allow it to explore a large source code repository, which
would otherwise pose a significant challenge as it would be impossible to fit
all the source code within the limited prompt length. Our results indicate that
on the widely used Defects4J benchmark, AutoFL could identify the faulty method
on the first try more often than all standalone techniques we compared against
from prior work. Nonetheless, there is ample room to improve performance, and
we encourage the further experimentation of language model-based fault
localization as a promising research area.

<p class="mathjax">Endeavors have been recently made to transfer knowledge from the labeled
pinhole image domain to the unlabeled panoramic image domain via Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA). The aim is to tackle the domain gaps caused by the
style disparities and distortion problem from the non-uniformly distributed
pixels of equirectangular projection (ERP). Previous works typically focus on
transferring knowledge based on geometric priors with specially designed
multi-branch network architectures. As a result, considerable computational
costs are induced, and meanwhile, their generalization abilities are profoundly
hindered by the variation of distortion among pixels. In this paper, we find
that the pixels' neighborhood regions of the ERP indeed introduce less
distortion. Intuitively, we propose a novel UDA framework that can effectively
address the distortion problems for panoramic semantic segmentation. In
comparison, our method is simpler, easier to implement, and more
computationally efficient. Specifically, we propose distortion-aware attention
(DA) capturing the neighboring pixel distribution without using any geometric
constraints. Moreover, we propose a class-wise feature aggregation (CFA) module
to iteratively update the feature representations with a memory bank. As such,
the feature similarity between two domains can be consistently optimized.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance while remarkably reducing 80% parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Explainable AI has the potential to support more interactive and fluid
co-creative AI systems which can creatively collaborate with people. To do
this, creative AI models need to be amenable to debugging by offering
eXplainable AI (XAI) features which are inspectable, understandable, and
modifiable. However, currently there is very little XAI for the arts. In this
work, we demonstrate how a latent variable model for music generation can be
made more explainable; specifically we extend MeasureVAE which generates
measures of music. We increase the explainability of the model by: i) using
latent space regularisation to force some specific dimensions of the latent
space to map to meaningful musical attributes, ii) providing a user interface
feedback loop to allow people to adjust dimensions of the latent space and
observe the results of these changes in real-time, iii) providing a
visualisation of the musical attributes in the latent space to help people
understand and predict the effect of changes to latent space dimensions. We
suggest that in doing so we bridge the gap between the latent space and the
generated musical outcomes in a meaningful way which makes the model and its
outputs more explainable and more debuggable.

<p class="mathjax">Tactile perception is an increasingly popular gateway in human-machine
interaction, yet universal design guidelines for tactile displays are still
lacking, largely due to the absence of methods to measure sensibility across
skin areas. In this study, we address this gap by developing and evaluating two
fully automated vibrotactile tasks that require subjects to discriminate the
position of vibrotactile stimuli using a two-interval forced-choice procedure
(2IFC). Of the two methodologies, one was initially validated through a
preliminary study involving 13 participants. Subsequently, we applied the
validated and improved vibrotactile testing procedure to a larger sample of 23
participants, enabling a direct and valid comparison with static perception.
Our findings reveal a significantly finer spatial acuity for static stimuli
perception compared to vibrotactile stimuli perception from a stimulus
separation of 15 mm onwards. This study introduces a novel method for
generating both universal thresholds and individual person-specific data for
vibratory perception, marking a critical step towards the development of
functional vibrotactile displays. The results underline the need for further
research in this area and provide a foundation for the development of universal
design guidelines for tactile displays.

<p class="mathjax">Vertex classification -- the problem of identifying the class labels of nodes
in a graph -- has applicability in a wide variety of domains. Examples include
classifying subject areas of papers in citation networks or roles of machines
in a computer network. Vertex classification using graph convolutional networks
is susceptible to targeted poisoning attacks, in which both graph structure and
node attributes can be changed in an attempt to misclassify a target node. This
vulnerability decreases users' confidence in the learning method and can
prevent adoption in high-stakes contexts. Defenses have also been proposed,
focused on filtering edges before creating the model or aggregating information
from neighbors more robustly. This paper considers an alternative: we leverage
network characteristics in the training data selection process to improve
robustness of vertex classifiers.
<br />We propose two alternative methods of selecting training data: (1) to select
the highest-degree nodes and (2) to iteratively select the node with the most
neighbors minimally connected to the training set. In the datasets on which the
original attack was demonstrated, we show that changing the training set can
make the network much harder to attack. To maintain a given probability of
attack success, the adversary must use far more perturbations; often a factor
of 2--4 over the random training baseline. These training set selection methods
often work in conjunction with the best recently published defenses to provide
even greater robustness. While increasing the amount of randomly selected
training data sometimes results in a more robust classifier, the proposed
methods increase robustness substantially more. We also run a simulation study
in which we demonstrate conditions under which each of the two methods
outperforms the other, controlling for the graph topology, homophily of the
labels, and node attributes.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach, based on mesh refinement or
parametric enrichment, for convection diffusion equations containing randomness
in their coefficients. A parametric system of convection diffusion equations
obtained by an application of stochastic Galerkin approach is discretized by
using a symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG) method with upwinding for
the convection term in the spatial domain. We show the reliability of the
proposed residual-based error estimator in the energy norm contributed by the
error due to the SIPG discretization, the error due to the data oscillations,
and the error due to the (generalized) polynomial chaos discretization in the
parametric space. To illustrate the performance of the proposed estimator,
several benchmark examples including a random diffusivity parameter, a random
velocity parameter, random diffusivity/velocity parameters, and a random (jump)
discontinuous diffusivity parameter, are tested.

<p class="mathjax">Patient's vital signs, which are displayed on monitors, make the
anesthesiologist's visual attention (VA) a key component in the safe management
of patients under general anesthesia; moreover, the distribution of said VA and
the ability to acquire specific cues throughout the anesthetic, may have a
direct impact on patient's outcome. Currently, most studies employ wearable
eye-tracking technologies to analyze anesthesiologists' visual patterns. Albeit
being able to produce meticulous data, wearable devices are not a sustainable
solution for large-scale or long-term use for data collection in the operating
room (OR). Thus, by utilizing a novel eye-tracking method in the form of deep
learning models that process monitor-mounted webcams, we collected continuous
behavioral data and gained insight into the anesthesiologist's VA distribution
with minimal disturbance to their natural workflow. In this study, we collected
OR video recordings using the proposed framework and compared different visual
behavioral patterns. We distinguished between baseline VA distribution during
uneventful periods to patterns associated with active phases or during
critical, unanticipated incidents. In the future, such a platform may serve as
a crucial component of context-aware assistive technologies in the OR.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based language models (TLMs) have widely been recognized to be a
cutting-edge technology for the successful development of deep-learning-based
solutions to problems and applications that require natural language processing
and understanding. Like for other textual domains, TLMs have indeed pushed the
state-of-the-art of AI approaches for many tasks of interest in the legal
domain. Despite the first Transformer model being proposed about six years ago,
there has been a rapid progress of this technology at an unprecedented rate,
whereby BERT and related models represent a major reference, also in the legal
domain. This article provides the first systematic overview of TLM-based
methods for AI-driven problems and tasks in the legal sphere. A major goal is
to highlight research advances in this field so as to understand, on the one
hand, how the Transformers have contributed to the success of AI in supporting
legal processes, and on the other hand, what are the current limitations and
opportunities for further research development.

<p class="mathjax">Various autonomous applications rely on recognizing specific known landmarks
in their environment. For example, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM)
is an important technique that lays the foundation for many common tasks, such
as navigation and long-term object tracking. This entails building a map on the
go based on sensory inputs which are prone to accumulating errors. Recognizing
landmarks in the environment plays a vital role in correcting these errors and
further improving the accuracy of SLAM. The most popular choice of sensors for
conducting SLAM today is optical sensors such as cameras or LiDAR sensors.
These can use landmarks such as QR codes as a prerequisite. However, such
sensors become unreliable in certain conditions, e.g., foggy, dusty,
reflective, or glass-rich environments. Sonar has proven to be a viable
alternative to manage such situations better. However, acoustic sensors also
require a different type of landmark. In this paper, we put forward a method to
detect the presence of bio-mimetic acoustic landmarks using support vector
machines trained on the frequency bands of the reflecting acoustic echoes using
an embedded real-time imaging sonar.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum annealers are specialized quantum computers for solving combinatorial
optimization problems using special characteristics of quantum computing (QC),
such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum tunneling. Theoretically,
quantum annealers can outperform classical computers. However, the currently
available quantum annealers are small-scale, i.e., they have limited quantum
bits (qubits); hence, they currently cannot demonstrate the quantum advantage.
Nonetheless, research is warranted to develop novel mechanisms to formulate
combinatorial optimization problems for quantum annealing (QA). However,
solving combinatorial problems with QA in software engineering remains
unexplored. Toward this end, we propose BootQA, the very first effort at
solving the test case minimization (TCM) problem with QA. In BootQA, we provide
a novel formulation of TCM for QA, followed by devising a mechanism to
incorporate bootstrap sampling to QA to optimize the use of qubits. We also
implemented our TCM formulation in three other optimization processes:
classical simulated annealing (SA), QA without problem decomposition, and QA
with an existing D-Wave problem decomposition strategy, and conducted an
empirical evaluation with three real-world TCM datasets. Results show that
BootQA outperforms QA without problem decomposition and QA with the existing
decomposition strategy in terms of effectiveness. Moreover, BootQA's
effectiveness is similar to SA. Finally, BootQA has higher efficiency in terms
of time when solving large TCM problems than the other three optimization
processes.

<p class="mathjax">On-Demand Ride-Pooling services have the potential to increase traffic
efficiency compared to private vehicle trips by decreasing parking space needed
and increasing vehicle occupancy due to higher vehicle utilization and shared
trips, respectively. Thereby, an operator controls a fleet of vehicles that
serve requested trips on-demand while trips can be shared. In this highly
dynamic and stochastic setting, asymmetric spatio-temporal request
distributions can drive the system towards an imbalance between demand and
supply when vehicles end up in regions with low demand. This imbalance would
lead to low fleet utilization and high customer waiting times. This study
proposes a novel rebalancing algorithm to predictively reposition idle fleet
vehicles to reduce this imbalance. The algorithm first samples artificial
requests from a predicted demand distribution and simulates future fleet states
to identify supply shortages. An assignment problem is formulated that assigns
repositioning trips considering multiple samples and forecast horizons. The
algorithm is implemented in an agent-based simulation framework and compared to
multiple state-of-the-art rebalancing algorithms. A case study for Chicago,
Illinois shows the benefits of applying the repositioning strategy by
increasing service rate and vehicle revenue hours by roughly 50% compared to a
service without repositioning. It additionally outperforms all comparison
algorithms by serving more customers, increasing the pooling efficiency and
decreasing customer waiting time regardless of the forecasting method applied.
As a trade-off, the computational time increases, but with a termination within
a couple of seconds it is still applicable for large-scale real world
instances.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to provide recommendations for
different domains (e.g., types of products) with overlapping users/items and is
common for platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, and LinkedIn that host multiple
services. Existing MDR models face two challenges: First, it is difficult to
disentangle knowledge that generalizes across domains (e.g., a user likes cheap
items) and knowledge specific to a single domain (e.g., a user likes blue
clothing but not blue cars). Second, they have limited ability to transfer
knowledge across domains with small overlaps. We propose a new MDR method named
EDDA with two key components, i.e., embedding disentangling recommender and
domain alignment, to tackle the two challenges respectively. In particular, the
embedding disentangling recommender separates both the model and embedding for
the inter-domain part and the intra-domain part, while most existing MDR
methods only focus on model-level disentangling. The domain alignment leverages
random walks from graph processing to identify similar user/item pairs from
different domains and encourages similar user/item pairs to have similar
embeddings, enhancing knowledge transfer. We compare EDDA with 12
state-of-the-art baselines on 3 real datasets. The results show that EDDA
consistently outperforms the baselines on all datasets and domains. All
datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/Stevenn9981/EDDA.

Subsequently, we demonstrate that this construction is optimal regarding the

<p class="mathjax">The ability of robots to autonomously navigate through 3D environments
depends on their comprehension of spatial concepts, ranging from low-level
geometry to high-level semantics, such as objects, places, and buildings. To
enable such comprehension, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a robust tool for
representing the environment as a layered graph of concepts and their
relationships. However, building these representations using monocular vision
systems in real-time remains a difficult task that has not been explored in
depth. This paper puts forth a real-time spatial perception system Mono-Hydra,
combining a monocular camera and an IMU sensor setup, focusing on indoor
scenarios. However, the proposed approach is adaptable to outdoor applications,
offering flexibility in its potential uses. The system employs a suite of deep
learning algorithms to derive depth and semantics. It uses a robocentric
visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm based on square-root information,
thereby ensuring consistent visual odometry with an IMU and a monocular camera.
This system achieves sub-20 cm error in real-time processing at 15 fps,
enabling real-time 3D scene graph construction using a laptop GPU (NVIDIA
3080). This enhances decision-making efficiency and effectiveness in simple
camera setups, augmenting robotic system agility. We make Mono-Hydra publicly

<p class="mathjax">Shrinking hardware structures and decreasing operating voltages lead to an
increasing number of transient hardware faults,which thus become a core problem
to consider for safety-critical systems. Here, systematic fault injection (FI),
where one program-under-test is systematically stressed with faults, provides
an in-depth resilience analysis in the presence of faults. However, FI
campaigns require many independent injection experiments and, combined, long
run times, especially if we aim for a high coverage of the fault space. One
cost factor is the forwarding phase, which is the time required to bring the
system-under test into the fault-free state at injection time. One common
technique to speed up the forwarding are checkpoints of the fault-free system
state at fixed points in time.
<br />In this paper, we show that the placement of checkpoints has a significant
influence on the required forwarding cycles, especially if we place faults
non-uniformly on the time axis. For this, we discuss the checkpoint-selection
problem in general, formalize it as a maximum-weight reward path problem in
graphs, propose an ILP formulation and a dynamic programming algorithm that
find the optimal solution, and provide a heuristic checkpoint-selection method
based on a genetic algorithm. Applied to the MiBench benchmark suite, our
approach consistently reduces the forward-phase cycles by at least 88 percent
and up to 99.934 percent when placing 16 checkpoints.

<p class="mathjax">Retrosynthesis consists of breaking down a chemical compound recursively
step-by-step into molecular precursors until a set of commercially available
molecules is found with the goal to provide a synthesis route. Its two primary
research directions, single-step retrosynthesis prediction, which models the
chemical reaction logic, and multi-step synthesis planning, which tries to find
the correct sequence of reactions, are inherently intertwined. Still, this
connection is not reflected in contemporary research. In this work, we combine
these two major research directions by applying multiple single-step
retrosynthesis models within multi-step synthesis planning and analyzing their
impact using public and proprietary reaction data. We find a disconnection
between high single-step performance and potential route-finding success,
suggesting that single-step models must be evaluated within synthesis planning
in the future. Furthermore, we show that the commonly used single-step
retrosynthesis benchmark dataset USPTO-50k is insufficient as this evaluation
task does not represent model performance and scalability on larger and more
diverse datasets. For multi-step synthesis planning, we show that the choice of
the single-step model can improve the overall success rate of synthesis
planning by up to +28% compared to the commonly used baseline model. Finally,
we show that each single-step model finds unique synthesis routes, and differs
in aspects such as route-finding success, the number of found synthesis routes,
and chemical validity, making the combination of single-step retrosynthesis
prediction and multi-step synthesis planning a crucial aspect when developing
future methods.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to cope accurately and fast with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
samples is crucial in real-world safety demanding applications. In this work we
first study the interplay between critical points of 3D point clouds and OOD
samples. Our findings are that common corruptions and outliers are often
interpreted as critical points. We generalize the notion of critical points
into importance measures. We show that training a classification network based
only on less important points dramatically improves robustness, at a cost of
minor performance loss on the clean set. We observe that normalized entropy is
highly informative for corruption analysis. An adaptive threshold based on
normalized entropy is suggested for selecting the set of uncritical points. Our
proposed importance measure is extremely fast to compute. We show it can be
used for a variety of applications, such as Explainable AI (XAI), Outlier
Removal, Uncertainty Estimation, Robust Classification and Adversarial Defense.
We reach SOTA results on the two latter tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Activity progress prediction aims to estimate what percentage of an activity
has been completed. Currently this is done with machine learning approaches,
trained and evaluated on complicated and realistic video datasets. The videos
in these datasets vary drastically in length and appearance. And some of the
activities have unanticipated developments, making activity progression
difficult to estimate. In this work, we examine the results obtained by
existing progress prediction methods on these datasets. We find that current
progress prediction methods seem not to extract useful visual information for
the progress prediction task. Therefore, these methods fail to exceed simple
frame-counting baselines. We design a precisely controlled dataset for activity
progress prediction and on this synthetic dataset we show that the considered
methods can make use of the visual information, when this directly relates to
the progress prediction. We conclude that the progress prediction task is
ill-posed on the currently used real-world datasets. Moreover, to fairly
measure activity progression we advise to consider a, simple but effective,
frame-counting baseline.

<p class="mathjax">Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services have been an active research topic in
recent years. Many studies focused on developing control algorithms to supply
efficient services. To cope with a large search space to solve the underlying
vehicle routing problem, studies usually apply hard time-constraints on pick-up
and drop-off while considering static network travel times to reduce
computational time. As travel times in real street networks are dynamic and
stochastic, assigned routes considered feasible by the control algorithm in one
time step might become infeasible in the next. Since once assigned and
confirmed, customers should still be part of the solution, damage control is
necessary to counteract this effect. In this study, a detailed simulation
framework for MoD services is coupled with a microscopic traffic simulation to
create dynamic and stochastic travel times, and tested in a case study for
Munich, Germany. Results showed that the combination of inaccurate travel time
estimation and damage control strategies for infeasible routes deteriorates the
performance of MoD services -- hailing and pooling -- significantly. Moreover,
customers suffer from unreliable pick-up time and travel time estimations.
Allowing re-assignments of initial vehicle schedules according to updated
system states helps to restore system efficiency and reliability, but only to a
minor extent.

<p class="mathjax">Polar codes with Reed-Solomon (RS) kernel have great potential in
next-generation communication systems due to their high polarization rate. In
this paper, we study the polarization characteristics of RS polar codes and
propose two types of partial orders (POs) for the synthesized channels, which
are supported by validity proofs. By combining these partial orders, a Partial
Distance-based Polarization Weight (PDPW) construction method is presented. The
proposed method achieves comparable performance to Monte-Carlo simulations
while requiring lower complexity. Additionally, a Minimum Polarization Weight
Puncturing (MPWP) scheme for rate-matching is proposed to enhance its practical
applicability in communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the
RS polar codes based on the proposed PDPW construction outperform the 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) NR polar codes in terms of standard code
performance and rate-matching performance.

<p class="mathjax">In real medical data, training samples typically show long-tailed
distributions with multiple labels. Class distribution of the medical data has
a long-tailed shape, in which the incidence of different diseases is quite
varied, and at the same time, it is not unusual for images taken from
symptomatic patients to be multi-label diseases. Therefore, in this paper, we
concurrently address these two issues by putting forth a robust asymmetric loss
on the polynomial function. Since our loss tackles both long-tailed and
multi-label classification problems simultaneously, it leads to a complex
design of the loss function with a large number of hyper-parameters. Although a
model can be highly fine-tuned due to a large number of hyper-parameters, it is
difficult to optimize all hyper-parameters at the same time, and there might be
a risk of overfitting a model. Therefore, we regularize the loss function using
the Hill loss approach, which is beneficial to be less sensitive against the
numerous hyper-parameters so that it reduces the risk of overfitting the model.
For this reason, the proposed loss is a generic method that can be applied to
most medical image classification tasks and does not make the training process
more time-consuming. We demonstrate that the proposed robust asymmetric loss
performs favorably against the long-tailed with multi-label medical image
classification in addition to the various long-tailed single-label datasets.
Notably, our method achieves Top-5 results on the CXR-LT dataset of the ICCV
CVAMD 2023 competition. We opensource our implementation of the robust
asymmetric loss in the public repository: https://github.com/kalelpark/RAL.

<p class="mathjax">Images taken under the low-light condition often contain blur and saturated
pixels at the same time. Deblurring images with saturated pixels is quite
challenging. Because of the limited dynamic range, the saturated pixels are
usually clipped in the imaging process and thus cannot be modeled by the linear
blur model. Previous methods use manually designed smooth functions to
approximate the clipping procedure. Their deblurring processes often require
empirically defined parameters, which may not be the optimal choices for
different images. In this paper, we develop a data-driven approach to model the
saturated pixels by a learned latent map. Based on the new model, the non-blind
deblurring task can be formulated into a maximum a posterior (MAP) problem,
which can be effectively solved by iteratively computing the latent map and the
latent image. Specifically, the latent map is computed by learning from a map
estimation network (MEN), and the latent image estimation process is
implemented by a Richardson-Lucy (RL)-based updating scheme. To estimate
high-quality deblurred images without amplified artifacts, we develop a prior
estimation network (PEN) to obtain prior information, which is further
integrated into the RL scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms both
quantitatively and qualitatively on synthetic and real-world images.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the deployment of multiple movable antennas (MAs) at the
base station (BS) for enhancing the multiuser communication performance. First,
we model the multiuser channel in the uplink to characterize the wireless
channel variation caused by MAs' movement at the BS. Then, an optimization
problem is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable rate among multiple
users for MA-aided uplink multiuser communications by jointly optimizing the
MAs' positions, their receive combining at the BS, and the transmit power of
users, under the constraints of finite moving region of MAs, minimum inter-MA
distance, and maximum transmit power of each user. To solve this challenging
non-convex optimization problem, a two-loop iterative algorithm is proposed by
leveraging the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Specifically, the
outer-loop updates the positions of a set of particles, where each particle's
position represents one realization of the antenna positioning vector (APV) of
all MAs. The inner-loop implements the fitness evaluation for each particle in
terms of the max-min achievable rate of multiple users with its corresponding
APV, where the receive combining matrix of the BS and the transmit power of
each user are optimized by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD)
technique. Simulation results show that the antenna position optimization for
MAs-aided BS can significantly improve the rate performance as compared to
conventional BS with fixed-position antennas (FPAs).

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play a crucial role in surveying marine
environments, carrying out underwater inspection tasks, and ocean exploration.
However, in order to ensure that the AUV is able to carry out its mission
successfully, a control system capable of adapting to changing environmental
conditions is required. Furthermore, to ensure the robotic platform's safe
operation, the onboard controller should be able to operate under certain
constraints. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Model Predictive
Path Integral Control (MPPI) for the control of an AUV. We utilise a non-linear
model of the AUV to propagate the samples of the MPPI, which allow us to
compute the control action in real time. We provide a detailed evaluation of
the effect of the main hyperparameters on the performance of the MPPI
controller. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the proposed method
with a classical PID and Cascade PID approach, demonstrating the superiority of
our proposed controller. Finally, we present results where environmental
constraints are added and show how MPPI can handle them by simply incorporating
those constraints in the cost function.

<p class="mathjax">Although App updates are frequent and software engineers would like to verify
updated features only, automated testing techniques verify entire Apps and are
thus wasting resources. We present Continuous Adaptation of Learned Models
(CALM), an automated App testing approach that efficiently tests App updates by
adapting App models learned when automatically testing previous App versions.
CALM focuses on functional testing. Since functional correctness can be mainly
verified through the visual inspection of App screens, CALM minimizes the
number of App screens to be visualized by software testers while maximizing the
percentage of updated methods and instructions exercised. Our empirical
evaluation shows that CALM exercises a significantly higher proportion of
updated methods and instructions than six state-of-the-art approaches, for the
same maximum number of App screens to be visually inspected. Further, in common
update scenarios, where only a small fraction of methods are updated, CALM is
even quicker to outperform all competing approaches in a more significant way.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of short video and live-streaming platforms has
revolutionized how consumers engage in online shopping. Instead of browsing
product pages, consumers are now turning to rich-content e-commerce, where they
can purchase products through dynamic and interactive media like short videos
and live streams. This emerging form of online shopping has introduced
technical challenges, as products may be presented differently across various
media domains. Therefore, a unified product representation is essential for
achieving cross-domain product recognition to ensure an optimal user search
experience and effective product recommendations. Despite the urgent industrial
need for a unified cross-domain product representation, previous studies have
predominantly focused only on product pages without taking into account short
videos and live streams. To fill the gap in the rich-content e-commerce area,
in this paper, we introduce a large-scale cRoss-dOmain Product Ecognition
dataset, called ROPE. ROPE covers a wide range of product categories and
contains over 180,000 products, corresponding to millions of short videos and
live streams. It is the first dataset to cover product pages, short videos, and
live streams simultaneously, providing the basis for establishing a unified
product representation across different media domains. Furthermore, we propose
a Cross-dOmain Product rEpresentation framework, namely COPE, which unifies
product representations in different domains through multimodal learning
including text and vision. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of COPE in learning a joint feature space for all
product domains.

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes the development of a detailed 3D geometric model of an
acoustical guitar. Modeling an instrument is a sophisticated task considering
the individual parts and their complex shapes. The geometry of the parts
visible from the outside can be measured using appropriate tools, but it is
very difficult to measure the details of the internal parts like bracing,
heels, and other features by hand through the sound hole. Otherwise, it would
be necessary to disassemble the guitar to measure the precise position and
dimensions of the parts inside it. Reassembling the guitar could result in
improper functioning. To avoid damaging the instrument by disassembling or
taking inaccurate measurements through the sound hole, a computer tomography
(CT) scan of the guitar body was performed. Using this method, cross-sectional
images of the guitar body in all the three dimensions were extracted with 1 mm
spacing between adjacent images. In total, approximately 2000 images were
generated and used in developing the geometric model of the guitar. The 3D
model will be further used to develop a vibro-acoustic simulation model of the
guitar

<p class="mathjax">Our modern world relies on a growing number of interconnected and interacting
devices, leading to a plethora of logs establishing audit trails for all kinds
of events. Simultaneously, logs become increasingly important for forensic
investigations, and thus, an adversary will aim to alter logs to avoid
culpability, e.g., by compromising devices that generate and store logs. Thus,
it is essential to ensure that no one can tamper with any logs without going
undetected. However, existing approaches to establish tamper evidence of logs
do not scale and cannot protect the increasingly large number of devices found
today, as they impose large storage or network overheads. Additionally, most
schemes do not provide an efficient mechanism to prove that individual events
have been logged to establish accountability when different devices interact.
<br />This paper introduces a novel scheme for practical large-scale tamper-evident
logging with the help of a trusted third party. To achieve this, we present a
new binary hash tree construction designed around timestamps to achieve
constant storage overhead with a configured temporal resolution. Additionally,
our design enables the efficient construction of shareable proofs, proving that
an event was indeed logged. Our evaluation shows that - using practical
parameters - our scheme can localize any tampering of logs with a sub-second
resolution, with a constant overhead of ~8KB per hour per device.

methods that could expedite the identification of software weaknesses without
reducing the process efficacy would benefit the software engineering industry
and thus benefit modern life. This research focuses on finding an efficient
machine learning algorithm to identify software weaknesses from requirement
specifications. The research uses the CWE repository and PROMISE exp dataset
for training. Keywords extracted using latent semantic analysis help map the
CWE categories to PROMISE_exp. Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM),
decision trees, neural network, and convolutional neural network (CNN)
algorithms were tested, with SVM and neural network producing reliable results.
The research is unique contribution lies in the mapping technique and algorithm
selection. It serves as a valuable reference for the secure software

<p class="mathjax">A deepfake is a photo or video of a person whose image has been digitally
altered or partially replaced with an image of someone else. Deepfakes have the
potential to cause a variety of problems and are often used maliciously. A
common usage is altering videos of prominent political figures and celebrities.
These deepfakes can portray them making offensive, problematic, and/or untrue
statements. Current deepfakes can be very realistic, and when used in this way,
can spread panic and even influence elections and political opinions. There are
many deepfake detection strategies currently in use but finding the most
comprehensive and universal method is critical. So, in this survey we will
address the problems of malicious deepfake creation and the lack of universal
deepfake detection methods. Our objective is to survey and analyze a variety of
current methods and advances in the field of deepfake detection.

<p class="mathjax">The LockBit 3.0 ransomware variant is arguably the most threatening of
malware in recent times. With no regard for a victim's industry, the ransomware
has undergone several evolutions to arrive at an adaptable and evasive variant
which has been a menace to governments and organisations, recently infiltrating
Advanced Computer Software group. Previous LockBit studies mostly concentrated
on measuring the impact of the ransomware attack, prevention, encryption
detection, decryption, or data recovery, thereby providing little or no benefit
to the less tech savvy populace as a detailed breakdown of the mode of attack
is rarely examined. This article analyses the LockBit 3.0 attack techniques
with a contextual illustration of the attack on Advanced Computer Software
group. With the NHS being a major client of the organisation, and its services
alongside 15 other clients being crippled for hours during the attack,
attention is drawn to how dreadful such disruption may be in critical
organisations. We observed that the upgrade of Lockbit based on releasing newer
versions is in a bid to continuously ensure the malware's efficiency - a virtue
that keeps it at the zenith - by staying ahead of improved defenses. Our study
highlights social engineering as a vibrant portal to Lockbit's maliciousness
and indicates an investment in detection systems may profit more than in
prevention systems. Therefore, further research should consider improving
detection systems against Lockbit 3.0.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated outstanding
performance in various fields, particularly in natural language understanding
and generation tasks. In complex application scenarios, users tend to engage in
multi-turn conversations with ChatGPT to keep contextual information and obtain
comprehensive responses. However, human forgetting and model contextual
forgetting remain prominent issues in multi-turn conversation scenarios, which
challenge the users' conversation comprehension and contextual continuity for
ChatGPT. To address these challenges, we propose an interactive conversation
visualization system called C5, which includes Global View, Topic View, and
Context-associated Q\&amp;A View. The Global View uses the GitLog diagram metaphor
to represent the conversation structure, presenting the trend of conversation
evolution and supporting the exploration of locally salient features. The Topic
View is designed to display all the question and answer nodes and their
relationships within a topic using the structure of a knowledge graph, thereby
display the relevance and evolution of conversations. The Context-associated
Q\&amp;A View consists of three linked views, which allow users to explore
individual conversations deeply while providing specific contextual information
when posing questions. The usefulness and effectiveness of C5 were evaluated
through a case study and a user study.

<p class="mathjax">Current research in zero-shot translation is plagued by several issues such
as high compute requirements, increased training time and off target
translations. Proposed remedies often come at the cost of additional data or
compute requirements. Pivot based neural machine translation is preferred over
a single-encoder model for most settings despite the increased training and
evaluation time. In this work, we overcome the shortcomings of zero-shot
translation by taking advantage of transliteration and linguistic similarity.
We build a single encoder-decoder neural machine translation system for
Dravidian-Dravidian multilingual translation and perform zero-shot translation.
We compare the data vs zero-shot accuracy tradeoff and evaluate the performance
of our vanilla method against the current state of the art pivot based method.
We also test the theory that morphologically rich languages require large
vocabularies by restricting the vocabulary using an optimal transport based
technique. Our model manages to achieves scores within 3 BLEU of large-scale
pivot-based models when it is trained on 50\% of the language directions.

<p class="mathjax">We examine whether symmetry can be used to defend tree-based ensemble
classifiers such as gradient-boosting decision trees (GBDTs) against
adversarial perturbation attacks. The idea is based on a recent symmetry
defense for convolutional neural network classifiers (CNNs) that utilizes CNNs'
lack of invariance with respect to symmetries. CNNs lack invariance because
they can classify a symmetric sample, such as a horizontally flipped image,
differently from the original sample. CNNs' lack of invariance also means that
CNNs can classify symmetric adversarial samples differently from the incorrect
classification of adversarial samples. Using CNNs' lack of invariance, the
recent CNN symmetry defense has shown that the classification of symmetric
adversarial samples reverts to the correct sample classification. In order to
apply the same symmetry defense to GBDTs, we examine GBDT invariance and are
the first to show that GBDTs also lack invariance with respect to symmetries.
We apply and evaluate the GBDT symmetry defense for nine datasets against six
perturbation attacks with a threat model that ranges from zero-knowledge to
perfect-knowledge adversaries. Using the feature inversion symmetry against
zero-knowledge adversaries, we achieve up to 100% accuracy on adversarial
samples even when default and robust classifiers have 0% accuracy. Using the
feature inversion and horizontal flip symmetries against perfect-knowledge
adversaries, we achieve up to over 95% accuracy on adversarial samples for the
GBDT classifier of the F-MNIST dataset even when default and robust classifiers
have 0% accuracy.

produce sequences of (mostly) coherent sentences. But are they saying anything
with those strings or simply babbling in a convincing simulacrum of language
use? This is a vague question, and there are many ways of making it precise.
Here we will address one aspect of the question, namely, whether LMs' words
refer: that is, whether the outputs of LMs achieve "word-to-world" connections.
There is prima facie reason to think they do not since LMs do not interact with
the world in the way that ordinary language users do. Drawing on insights from
the externalist tradition in philosophy of language, we argue that appearances
are misleading and that there is good reason to think that LMs can refer.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel method for computing bijective density-equalizing
quasiconformal (DEQ) flattening maps for multiply-connected open surfaces. In
conventional density-equalizing maps, shape deformations are solely driven by
prescribed constraints on the density distribution, defined as the population
per unit area, while the bijectivity and local geometric distortions of the
mappings are uncontrolled. Also, prior methods have primarily focused on
simply-connected open surfaces but not surfaces with more complicated
topologies. Our proposed method overcomes these issues by formulating the
density diffusion process as a quasiconformal flow, which allows us to
effectively control the local geometric distortion and guarantee the
bijectivity of the mapping by solving an energy minimization problem involving
the Beltrami coefficient of the mapping. To achieve an optimal parameterization
of multiply-connected surfaces, we develop an iterative scheme that optimizes
both the shape of the target planar circular domain and the density-equalizing
quasiconformal map onto it. In addition, landmark constraints can be
incorporated into our proposed method for consistent feature alignment. The
method can also be naturally applied to simply-connected open surfaces. By
changing the prescribed population, a large variety of surface flattening maps
with different desired properties can be achieved. The method is tested on both
synthetic and real examples, demonstrating its efficacy in various applications
in computer graphics and medical imaging.

Category Feature Transformer (CFT) that explores the flow of category embedding
and transformation among multi-stage features through the prevalent multi-head
attention mechanism. CFT learns unified feature embeddings for individual
semantic categories from high-level features during each aggregation process
and dynamically broadcasts them to high-resolution features. Integrating the
proposed CFT into a typical feature pyramid structure exhibits superior
performance over a broad range of backbone networks. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular semantic segmentation benchmarks. Specifically, the
proposed CFT obtains a compelling 55.1% mIoU with greatly reduced model
parameters and computations on the challenging ADE20K dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Hardware security keys undoubtedly have advantage for users as "usability"
pain is trivial compared to the maximum "security" gain in authentication.
Naturally, the hardware factor in the authentication received a widespread
adoption amongst average users, as it is ergonomically less demanding than
phone texts or authentication prompts. This ergonomic advantage in particular
is essential for users who are blind or low vision, as their interaction with a
phone is impractical. However, the "usability" for low vision or blind users
pain might be much higher than an average well-bodied user for the same
"security" gain. In an effort to learn more we conducted a usability assessment
with ten low vision or blind users setting up the OnlyKey two-factor
authentication key. First, the setup process was insurmountable for more than
half of the participants, resulting in a situation where the hardware key was
abandoned. Secondly, the lack of tactile orientation led participants to
consider it as both impractical, and prone to difficulties locating or loosing
it. We discuss the implications of our findings for future improvements in
usable authentication for visually impaired users.

<p class="mathjax">Channel modelling is essential to designing modern wireless communication
systems. The increasing complexity of channel modelling and the cost of
collecting high-quality wireless channel data have become major challenges. In
this paper, we propose a diffusion model based channel sampling approach for
rapidly synthesizing channel realizations from limited data. We use a diffusion
model with a U Net based architecture operating in the frequency space domain.
To evaluate how well the proposed model reproduces the true distribution of
channels in the training dataset, two evaluation metrics are used: $i)$ the
approximate $2$-Wasserstein distance between real and generated distributions
of the normalized power spectrum in the antenna and frequency domains and $ii)$
precision and recall metric for distributions. We show that, compared to
existing GAN based approaches which suffer from mode collapse and unstable
training, our diffusion based approach trains stably and generates diverse and
high-fidelity samples from the true channel distribution. We also show that we
can pretrain the model on a simulated urban macro-cellular channel dataset and
fine-tune it on a smaller, out-of-distribution urban micro-cellular dataset,
therefore showing that it is feasible to model real world channels using
limited data with this approach.

<p class="mathjax">The Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a pivotal role in
shaping the impact of large language models (LLMs), contributing significantly
to controlling output toxicity and selecting output styles, particularly as
LLMs often harbor misleading content, highlighting the urgency to align them
with human values for secure AI systems. The RLHF, characterized by complexity,
instability, and sensitivity to hyperparameters, makes the evaluation of the
reward model for complex tasks challenging, thereby further complicating the
use of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this paper, we introduce a simple
task designed to employ Gloden as a reward model that validates the
effectiveness of PPO and inspires it, primarily explaining the task of
utilizing PPO to manipulate the tokenizer length of the output generated by the
model. Experiments confirm that PPO is not only effective in manipulating the
output tokenizer length to a certain extent in this type of task but also
exhibits facilitated training once the influence of the reward model effect is
excluded, making it an exciting development.

studied as means of explanation. The Banzhaf value, originally developed in
Game Theory, is a natural measure of fact contribution, yet its efficient
computation for select-project-join-union queries is challenging. In this
paper, we introduce three algorithms to compute the Banzhaf value of database
facts: an exact algorithm, an anytime deterministic approximation algorithm
with relative error guarantees, and an algorithm for ranking and top-$k$. They
have three key building blocks: compilation of query lineage into an equivalent
function that allows efficient Banzhaf value computation; dynamic programming
computation of the Banzhaf values of variables in a Boolean function using the
Banzhaf values for constituent functions; and a mechanism to compute
efficiently lower and upper bounds on Banzhaf values for any positive DNF
function.
<br />We complement the algorithms with a dichotomy for the Banzhaf-based ranking
problem: given two facts, deciding whether the Banzhaf value of one is greater
than of the other is tractable for hierarchical queries and intractable for
non-hierarchical queries.
<br />We show experimentally that our algorithms significantly outperform exact and
approximate algorithms from prior work, most times up to two orders of
magnitude. Our algorithms can also cover challenging problem instances that are
beyond reach for prior work.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content

while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our comprehensive
system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate
the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods

<p class="mathjax">Lifelong indoor localization in a given map is the basis for navigation of
autonomous mobile robots. In this letter, we address the problem of robust
localization in cluttered indoor environments like office spaces and corridors
using 3D LiDAR point clouds in a given Area Graph, which is a hierarchical,
topometric semantic map representation that uses polygons to demark areas such
as rooms, corridors or buildings. This representation is very compact, can
represent different floors of buildings through its hierarchy and provides
semantic information that helps with localization, like poses of doors and
glass. In contrast to this, commonly used map representations, such as
occupancy grid maps or point clouds, lack these features and require frequent
updates in response to environmental changes (e.g. moved furniture), unlike our
approach, which matches against lifelong architectural features such as walls
and doors. For that we apply filtering to remove clutter from the 3D input
point cloud and then employ further scoring and weight functions for
localization. Given a broad initial guess from WiFi localization, our
experiments show that our global localization and the weighted point to line
ICP pose tracking perform very well, even when compared to localization and
SLAM algorithms that use the current, feature-rich cluttered map for
localization.

<p class="mathjax">Skin lesion analysis models are biased by artifacts placed during image
acquisition, which influence model predictions despite carrying no clinical
information. Solutions that address this problem by regularizing models to
prevent learning those spurious features achieve only partial success, and
existing test-time debiasing techniques are inappropriate for skin lesion
analysis due to either making unrealistic assumptions on the distribution of
test data or requiring laborious annotation from medical practitioners. We
propose TTS (Test-Time Selection), a human-in-the-loop method that leverages
positive (e.g., lesion area) and negative (e.g., artifacts) keypoints in test
samples. TTS effectively steers models away from exploiting spurious
artifact-related correlations without retraining, and with less annotation
requirements. Our solution is robust to a varying availability of annotations,
and different levels of bias. We showcase on the ISIC2019 dataset (for which we
release a subset of annotated images) how our model could be deployed in the
real-world for mitigating bias.

<p class="mathjax">The spread of toxic content online is an important problem that has adverse
effects on user experience online and in our society at large. Motivated by the
importance and impact of the problem, research focuses on developing solutions
to detect toxic content, usually leveraging machine learning (ML) models
trained on human-annotated datasets. While these efforts are important, these
models usually do not generalize well and they can not cope with new trends
(e.g., the emergence of new toxic terms). Currently, we are witnessing a shift
in the approach to tackling societal issues online, particularly leveraging
large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or T5 that are trained on vast corpora
and have strong generalizability. In this work, we investigate how we can use
LLMs and prompt learning to tackle the problem of toxic content, particularly
focusing on three tasks; 1) Toxicity Classification, 2) Toxic Span Detection,
and 3) Detoxification. We perform an extensive evaluation over five model
architectures and eight datasets demonstrating that LLMs with prompt learning
can achieve similar or even better performance compared to models trained on
these specific tasks. We find that prompt learning achieves around 10\%
improvement in the toxicity classification task compared to the baselines,
while for the toxic span detection task we find better performance to the best
baseline (0.643 vs. 0.640 in terms of $F_1$-score). Finally, for the
detoxification task, we find that prompt learning can successfully reduce the
average toxicity score (from 0.775 to 0.213) while preserving semantic meaning.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural network (DNN) deployment has been confined to larger hardware
devices due to their expensive computational requirements. This challenge has
recently reached another scale with the emergence of large language models
(LLMs). In order to reduce both their memory footprint and latency, a promising
technique is quantization. It consists in converting floating point
representations to low bit-width fixed point representations, usually by
assuming a uniform mapping onto a regular grid. This process, referred to in
the literature as uniform quantization, may however be ill-suited as most DNN
weights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution. This is even worse
on LLMs whose weight distributions are known to exhibit large, high impact,
outlier values. In this work, we propose an improvement over the most commonly
adopted way to tackle this limitation in deep learning models quantization,
namely, non-uniform quantization. NUPES leverages automorphisms to preserve the
scalar multiplications. Such transformations are derived from power functions.
However, the optimization of the exponent parameter and weight values remains a
challenging and novel problem which could not be solved with previous post
training optimization techniques which only learn to round up or down weight
values in order to preserve the predictive function. We circumvent this
limitation with a new paradigm: learning new quantized weights over the entire
quantized space. Similarly, we enable the optimization of the power exponent,
i.e. the optimization of the quantization operator itself during training by
alleviating all the numerical instabilities. The resulting predictive function
is compatible with integer-only low-bit inference. We show the ability of the
method to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates in both, data-free and
data-driven configurations.

<p class="mathjax">Inter-city highway transportation is significant for urban life. As one of
the key functions in intelligent transportation system (ITS), traffic
evaluation always plays significant role nowadays, and daily traffic flow
prediction still faces challenges at network-wide toll stations. On the one
hand, the data imbalance in practice among various locations deteriorates the
performance of prediction. On the other hand, complex correlative
spatio-temporal factors cannot be comprehensively employed in long-term
duration. In this paper, a prediction method is proposed for daily traffic flow
in highway domain through spatio-temporal deep learning. In our method, data
normalization strategy is used to deal with data imbalance, due to long-tail
distribution of traffic flow at network-wide toll stations. And then, based on
graph convolutional network, we construct networks in distinct semantics to
capture spatio-temporal features. Beside that, meteorology and calendar
features are used by our model in the full connection stage to extra external
characteristics of traffic flow. By extensive experiments and case studies in
one Chinese provincial highway, our method shows clear improvement in
predictive accuracy than baselines and practical benefits in business.

<p class="mathjax">Object goal navigation aims to navigate an agent to locations of a given
object category in unseen environments. Classical methods explicitly build maps
of environments and require extensive engineering while lacking semantic
information for object-oriented exploration. On the other hand, end-to-end
learning methods alleviate manual map design and predict actions using implicit
representations. Such methods, however, lack an explicit notion of geometry and
may have limited ability to encode navigation history. In this work, we propose
an implicit spatial map for object goal navigation. Our implicit map is
recursively updated with new observations at each step using a transformer. To
encourage spatial reasoning, we introduce auxiliary tasks and train our model
to reconstruct explicit maps as well as to predict visual features, semantic
labels and actions. Our method significantly outperforms the state of the art
on the challenging MP3D dataset and generalizes well to the HM3D dataset. We
successfully deploy our model on a real robot and achieve encouraging object
goal navigation results in real scenes using only a few real-world
demonstrations. Code, trained models and videos are available at

depth. Thus, it acts differently from other tasks (e.g., classification and
segmentation) in many ways. In this paper, we find that self-supervised
monocular depth estimation shows a direction sensitivity and environmental
dependency in the feature representation. But the current backbones borrowed
from other tasks pay less attention to handling different types of
environmental information, limiting the overall depth accuracy. To bridge this
gap, we propose a new Direction-aware Cumulative Convolution Network (DaCCN),
which improves the depth feature representation in two aspects. First, we
propose a direction-aware module, which can learn to adjust the feature
extraction in each direction, facilitating the encoding of different types of
information. Secondly, we design a new cumulative convolution to improve the
efficiency for aggregating important environmental information. Experiments
show that our method achieves significant improvements on three widely used
benchmarks, KITTI, Cityscapes, and Make3D, setting a new state-of-the-art
performance on the popular benchmarks with all three types of self-supervision.

<p class="mathjax">Biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tends to become cumbersome for
most researchers, frequently due to the amount and heterogeneity of text to be
processed. To address this challenge, the industry is continuously developing
highly efficient tools and creating more flexible engineering solutions. This
work presents the integration between industry data engineering solutions for
efficient data processing and academic systems developed for Named Entity

reflects an integration of those components with external knowledge in the form
of additional training data from other datasets and biomedical ontologies. We
used this pipeline in the 2022 LitCoin NLP Challenge, where our team
LasigeUnicage was awarded the 7th Prize out of approximately 200 participating

<p class="mathjax">In today's chemical production plants, human field operators perform frequent
checks on the plant's integrity to guarantee high safety standards, and thus
are possibly the first to encounter dangerous operating conditions. To
alleviate their tasks of failure detection and monitoring by audio, visual, and
olfactory perceptions, we present a robotic system that consists of an
autonomously navigating robot integrated with various sensors and data
processing. We aim to resemble the human sensing and interpretation
capabilities of sight, smell, and hearing, for providing automated inspection.
We evaluate our system extensively at a wastewater facility in full working
conditions. Our results demonstrate that the system is able to robustly
navigate a plant and to provide useful information about critical operating
conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Discrete-choice models are used in economics, marketing and revenue
management to predict customer purchase probabilities, say as a function of
prices and other features of the offered assortment. While they have been shown
to be expressive, capturing customer heterogeneity and behaviour, they are also
hard to estimate, often based on many unobservables like utilities; and
moreover, they still fail to capture many salient features of customer
behaviour. A natural question then, given their success in other contexts, is
if neural networks can eliminate the necessity of carefully building a
context-dependent customer behaviour model and hand-coding and tuning the
estimation. It is unclear however how one would incorporate assortment effects
into such a neural network, and also how one would optimize the assortment with
such a black-box generative model of choice probabilities. In this paper we
investigate first whether a single neural network architecture can predict
purchase probabilities for datasets from various contexts and generated under
various models and assumptions. Next, we develop an assortment optimization
formulation that is solvable by off-the-shelf integer programming solvers. We
compare against a variety of benchmark discrete-choice models on simulated as
well as real-world datasets, developing training tricks along the way to make
the neural network prediction and subsequent optimization robust and comparable
in performance to the alternates.

<p class="mathjax">For long-duration operations in GPS-denied environments, accurate and
repeatable waypoint navigation is an essential capability. While simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) works well for single-session operations,
repeated, multi-session operations require robots to navigate to the same
spot(s) accurately and precisely each and every time. Localization and
navigation errors can build up from one session to the next if they are not
accounted for. Localization using a global reference map works well, but there
are no publicly available packages for quickly building maps and navigating
with them. We propose a new architecture using a combination of two publicly
available packages with a newly released package to create a fully functional
multi-session navigation system for ground vehicles. The system takes just a
few hours from the beginning of the first manual scan to perform autonomous
waypoint navigation.

<p class="mathjax">Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) becomes more and more important in a world
where robots integrate fast in all aspects of our lives but HRI applications
depend massively on the utilized robotic system as well as the deployment
environment and cultural differences. Because of these variable dependencies it
is often not feasible to use a data-driven approach to train a model for human
intent recognition. Expert systems have been proven to close this gap very
efficiently. Furthermore, it is important to support understandability in HRI
systems to establish trust in the system. To address the above-mentioned
challenges in HRI we present an adaptable python library in which current
state-of-the-art Models for context recognition can be integrated. For
Context-Based Intention Recognition a two-layer Bayesian Network (BN) is used.
The bayesian approach offers explainability and clarity in the creation of
scenarios and is easily extendable with more modalities. Additionally, it can
be used as an expert system if no data is available but can as well be
fine-tuned when data becomes available.

<p class="mathjax">We replace the multiplication and sigmoid function of the conventional
recurrent gate with addition and ReLU activation. This mechanism is designed to
maintain long-term memory for sequence processing but at a reduced
computational cost, thereby opening up for more efficient execution or larger
models on restricted hardware. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gating
mechanisms such as LSTM and GRU have been widely successful in learning from
sequential data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.
Conventionally, the update based on current inputs and the previous state
history is each multiplied with dynamic weights and combined to compute the
next state. However, multiplication can be computationally expensive,
especially for certain hardware architectures or alternative arithmetic systems
such as homomorphic encryption. It is demonstrated that the novel gating
mechanism can capture long-term dependencies for a standard synthetic sequence
learning task while significantly reducing computational costs such that
execution time is reduced by half on CPU and by one-third under encryption.
Experimental results on handwritten text recognition tasks furthermore show
that the proposed architecture can be trained to achieve comparable accuracy to
conventional GRU and LSTM baselines. The gating mechanism introduced in this
paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic
encryption by avoiding the multiplication of encrypted variables. It can also
support quantization in (unencrypted) plaintext applications, with the
potential for substantial performance gains since the addition-based
formulation can avoid the expansion to double precision often required for
multiplication.

<p class="mathjax">Automated medical report generation has become increasingly important in
medical analysis. It can produce computer-aided diagnosis descriptions and thus
significantly alleviate the doctors' work. Inspired by the huge success of
neural machine translation and image captioning, various deep learning methods
have been proposed for medical report generation. However, due to the inherent
properties of medical data, including data imbalance and the length and
correlation between report sequences, the generated reports by existing methods
may exhibit linguistic fluency but lack adequate clinical accuracy. In this
work, we propose an image-to-indicator hierarchical transformer (IIHT)
framework for medical report generation. It consists of three modules, i.e., a
classifier module, an indicator expansion module and a generator module. The
classifier module first extracts image features from the input medical images
and produces disease-related indicators with their corresponding states. The
disease-related indicators are subsequently utilised as input for the indicator
expansion module, incorporating the "data-text-data" strategy. The
transformer-based generator then leverages these extracted features along with
image features as auxiliary information to generate final reports. Furthermore,
the proposed IIHT method is feasible for radiologists to modify disease
indicators in real-world scenarios and integrate the operations into the
indicator expansion module for fluent and accurate medical report generation.
Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods under
various evaluation metrics demonstrate the great performance of the proposed
method.

<p class="mathjax">In real-world traffic scenarios, agents such as pedestrians and car drivers
often observe neighboring agents who exhibit similar behavior as examples and
then mimic their actions to some extent in their own behavior. This information
can serve as prior knowledge for trajectory prediction, which is unfortunately
largely overlooked in current trajectory prediction models. This paper
introduces a novel Predecessor-and-Successor (PnS) method that incorporates a
predecessor tracing module to model the influence of predecessors (identified
from concurrent neighboring agents) on the successor (target agent) within the
same scene. The method utilizes the moving patterns of these predecessors to
guide the predictor in trajectory prediction. PnS effectively aligns the motion
encodings of the successor with multiple potential predecessors in a
probabilistic manner, facilitating the decoding process. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of PnS by integrating it into a graph-based predictor for
pedestrian trajectory prediction on the ETH/UCY datasets, resulting in a new
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we replace the HD map-based
scene-context module with our PnS method in a transformer-based predictor for
vehicle trajectory prediction on the nuScenes dataset, showing that the
predictor maintains good prediction performance even without relying on any map
information.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) is widely used today, especially through deep neural
networks (DNNs), however, increasing computational load and resource
requirements have led to cloud-based solutions. To address this problem, a new
generation of networks called Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) has emerged, which
mimic the behavior of the human brain to improve efficiency and reduce energy
consumption. These networks often process large amounts of sensitive
information, such as confidential data, and thus privacy issues arise.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a solution, allowing calculations to be
performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. This research compares
traditional DNNs and SNNs using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) encryption
scheme. The LeNet-5 model, a widely-used convolutional architecture, is used
for both DNN and SNN models based on the LeNet-5 architecture, and the networks
are trained and compared using the FashionMNIST dataset. The results show that
SNNs using HE achieve up to 40% higher accuracy than DNNs for low values of the
plaintext modulus t, although their execution time is longer due to their
time-coding nature with multiple time-steps.

<p class="mathjax">Recent dataset search platforms use ML task-based utility measures rather
than metadata-based keywords, to search large dataset corpora. Requesters
provide an initial dataset, and the platform seeks additional datasets that
augment -- join or union -- requester's dataset to most improve the model
(e.g., linear regression) performance. Although effective, current task-based
data searches are stymied by (1) high latency which deters users, (2) privacy
concerns for regulatory standards, and (3) low data quality which provides low
utility. We introduce Mileena, a fast, private, and high-quality task-based
dataset search platform. At its heart, Mileena is built on pre-computed
semi-ring sketches for efficient ML training and evaluation. Based on
semi-ring, we develop a novel Factorized Privacy Mechanism that makes the
search differentially private and scales to arbitrary corpus sizes and numbers
of requests without major quality degradation. We also demonstrate the early
promise in using LLM-based agents for automatic data transformation and
applying semi-rings to support causal discovery and treatment effect

<p class="mathjax">Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been
demonstrated to be effective in solving multi-criteria decision-making
problems. In real-world applications, analysts often employ several algorithms
concurrently and compare their solution sets to gain insight into the
characteristics of different algorithms and explore a broader range of feasible
solutions. However, EMO algorithms are typically treated as black boxes,
leading to difficulties in performing detailed analysis and comparisons between
the internal evolutionary processes. Inspired by the successful application of
visual analytics tools in explainable AI, we argue that interactive
visualization can significantly enhance the comparative analysis between
multiple EMO algorithms. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework
that enables the exploration and comparison of evolutionary processes in EMO
algorithms. Guided by a literature review and expert interviews, the proposed
framework addresses various analytical tasks and establishes a multi-faceted
visualization design to support the comparative analysis of intermediate
generations in the evolution as well as solution sets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework through case studies on benchmarking and
real-world multi-objective optimization problems to elucidate how analysts can
leverage our framework to inspect and compare diverse algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In various service-oriented applications such as distributed autonomous
delivery, healthcare, tourism, transportation, and many others, where service
agents need to perform serial and time-bounded tasks to achieve their goals,
quality of service must constantly be assured. In addition to safety
requirements, such agents also need to fulfill performance requirements in
order to satisfy their quality of service. This paper proposes the novel
quality-aware time window temporal logic (QTWTL) by extending the traditional
time window temporal logic (TWTL) with two operators for counting and
aggregation operations. We also propose offline runtime monitoring algorithms
for the performance monitoring of QTWTL specifications. To analyze the
feasibility and efficiency of our proposed approach, we generate a large number
of traces using the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission Trip Record
data, formalize their performance requirements using QTWTL, and monitor them
using the proposed algorithms. The obtained results show that the monitoring
algorithm has a linear space and time complexity with respect to the number of
traces monitored.

<p class="mathjax">Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions for
source code. The prevailing approaches adopt transformer-based encoder-decoder
architectures, where the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the source code is
utilized for encoding structural information. However, ASTs are much longer
than the corresponding source code, and existing methods ignore this size
constraint by directly feeding the entire linearized AST into the encoders.
This simplistic approach makes it challenging to extract truly valuable
dependency relations from the overlong input sequence and leads to significant
computational overhead due to self-attention applied to all nodes in the AST.
<br />To address this issue effectively and efficiently, we present a model,
AST-MHSA that uses multi-head attention to extract the important semantic
information from the AST. The model consists of two main components: an encoder
and a decoder. The encoder takes as input the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the
code and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder then takes these
hidden states as input and generates a natural language summary of the code.
<br />The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to learn different
representations of the input code, which can be combined to generate a more
comprehensive summary. The model is trained on a dataset of code and summaries,
and the parameters of the model are optimized to minimize the loss between the
generated summaries and the ground-truth summaries.

<p class="mathjax">Video moment localization aims to retrieve the target segment of an untrimmed
video according to the natural language query. Weakly supervised methods gains
attention recently, as the precise temporal location of the target segment is
not always available. However, one of the greatest challenges encountered by
the weakly supervised method is implied in the mismatch between the video and
language induced by the coarse temporal annotations. To refine the
vision-language alignment, recent works contrast the cross-modality
similarities driven by reconstructing masked queries between positive and
negative video proposals. However, the reconstruction may be influenced by the
latent spurious correlation between the unmasked and the masked parts, which
distorts the restoring process and further degrades the efficacy of contrastive
learning since the masked words are not completely reconstructed from the
cross-modality knowledge. In this paper, we discover and mitigate this spurious
correlation through a novel proposed counterfactual cross-modality reasoning
method. Specifically, we first formulate query reconstruction as an aggregated
causal effect of cross-modality and query knowledge. Then by introducing
counterfactual cross-modality knowledge into this aggregation, the spurious
impact of the unmasked part contributing to the reconstruction is explicitly
modeled. Finally, by suppressing the unimodal effect of masked query, we can
rectify the reconstructions of video proposals to perform reasonable
contrastive learning. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces ESBMC v7.3, the latest Efficient SMT-Based
Context-Bounded Model Checker version, which now incorporates a new clang-based
C++ front-end. While the previous CPROVER-based front-end served well for
handling C++03 programs, it encountered challenges keeping up with the evolving
C++ language. As new language and library features were added in each C++
version, the limitations of the old front-end became apparent, leading to
difficult-to-maintain code. Consequently, modern C++ programs were challenging
to verify. To overcome this obstacle, we redeveloped the front-end, opting for
a more robust approach using clang. The new front-end efficiently traverses the
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in-memory using clang APIs and transforms each AST
node into ESBMC's Intermediate Representation. Through extensive
experimentation, our results demonstrate that ESBMC v7.3 with the new front-end
significantly reduces parse and conversion errors, enabling successful
verification of a wide range of C++ programs, thereby outperforming previous
ESBMC versions.

<p class="mathjax">The Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP) system is a fundamental model in
plasma physics that describes the Brownian motion of a large ensemble of
particles within a surrounding bath. Under the high-field scaling, both
collision and field are dominant. This paper introduces two
Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNN) methods within a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework for solving the VPFP system in the high-field
regime. These methods aim to overcome the computational challenges posed by
high dimensionality and multiple scales of the system. The first APNN method
leverages the micro-macro decomposition model of the original VPFP system,
while the second is based on the mass conservation law. Both methods ensure
that the loss function of the neural networks transitions naturally from the
kinetic model to the high-field limit model, thereby preserving the correct
asymptotic behavior. Through extensive numerical experiments, these APNN
methods demonstrate their effectiveness in solving multiscale and high
dimensional uncertain problems, as well as their broader applicability for
problems with long time duration and non-equilibrium initial data.

<p class="mathjax">An enriched approximation space is the span of a conventional basis with a
few extra functions included, for example to capture known features of the
solution to a computational problem. Adding functions to a basis makes it
overcomplete and, consequently, the corresponding discretized approximation
problem may require solving an ill-conditioned system. Recent research
indicates that these systems can still provide highly accurate numerical
approximations under reasonable conditions. In this paper we propose an
efficient algorithm to compute such approximations. It is based on the AZ
algorithm for overcomplete sets and frames, which simplifies in the case of an
enriched basis. In addition, analysis of the original AZ algorithm and of the
proposed variant gives constructive insights on how to achieve optimal and
stable discretizations using enriched bases. We apply the algorithm to examples
of enriched approximation spaces in literature, including a few non-standard
approximation problems and an enriched spectral method for a 2D boundary value
problem, and show that the simplified AZ algorithm is indeed stable, accurate
and efficient.

<p class="mathjax">A shared space area is a low-speed urban area in which pedestrians, cyclists,
and vehicles share the road, often relying on informal interaction rules and
greatly expanding freedom of movement for pedestrians and cyclists. While
shared space has the potential to improve pedestrian priority in urban areas,
it presents unique challenges for pedestrian-AV interaction due to the absence
of a clear right of way. The current study applied Virtual Reality (VR)
experiments to investigate pedestrian-AV interaction in a shared space, with a
particular focus on the impact of external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on
pedestrian crossing behavior. Fifty-three participants took part in the VR
experiment and three eHMI conditions were investigated: no eHMI, eHMI with a
pedestrian sign on the windshield, and eHMI with a projected zebra crossing on
the road. Data collected via VR and questionnaires were used for objective and
subjective measures to understand pedestrian-AV interaction. The study revealed
that the presence of eHMI had an impact on participants' gazing behavior but
not on their crossing decisions. Additionally, participants had a positive user
experience with the current VR setting and expressed a high level of trust and
perceived safety during their interaction with the AV. These findings highlight
the potential of utilizing VR to explore and understand pedestrian-AV
interactions.

<p class="mathjax">In today's rapidly evolving urban landscapes, efficient and accurate mapping
of road infrastructure is critical for optimizing transportation systems,
enhancing road safety, and improving the overall mobility experience for
drivers and commuters. Yet, a formidable bottleneck obstructs progress - the
laborious and time-intensive manual identification of intersections. Simply
considering the shear number of intersections that need to be identified, and
the labor hours required per intersection, the need for an automated solution
becomes undeniable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that
leverages connected vehicle data and cutting-edge deep learning techniques. By
employing geohashing to segment vehicle trajectories and then generating image
representations of road segments, we utilize the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once
version 5) algorithm for accurate classification of both straight road segments
and intersections. Experimental results demonstrate an impressive overall
classification accuracy of 95%, with straight roads achieving a remarkable 97%
F1 score and intersections reaching a 90% F1 score. This approach not only
saves time and resources but also enables more frequent updates and a
comprehensive understanding of the road network. Our research showcases the
potential impact on traffic management, urban planning, and autonomous vehicle
navigation systems. The fusion of connected vehicle data and deep learning
models holds promise for a transformative shift in road infrastructure mapping,
propelling us towards a smarter, safer, and more connected transportation
ecosystem.

<p class="mathjax">Although deep learning models have shown impressive performance on supervised
learning tasks, they often struggle to generalize well when the training
(source) and test (target) domains differ. Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA)
has emerged as a popular solution to this problem. However, current DA
techniques rely on visual backbones, which may lack semantic richness. Despite
the potential of large-scale vision-language foundation models like CLIP, their
effectiveness for DA has yet to be fully explored. To address this gap, we
introduce AD-CLIP, a domain-agnostic prompt learning strategy for CLIP that
aims to solve the DA problem in the prompt space. We leverage the frozen vision
backbone of CLIP to extract both image style (domain) and content information,
which we apply to learn prompt tokens. Our prompts are designed to be
domain-invariant and class-generalizable, by conditioning prompt learning on
image style and content features simultaneously. We use standard supervised
contrastive learning in the source domain, while proposing an entropy
minimization strategy to align domains in the embedding space given the target
domain data. We also consider a scenario where only target domain samples are
available during testing, without any source domain data, and propose a
cross-domain style mapping network to hallucinate domain-agnostic tokens. Our
extensive experiments on three benchmark DA datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of AD-CLIP compared to existing literature.

<p class="mathjax">Modern transportation planning relies heavily on accurate predictions of
person and vehicle trips. However, traditional planning models often fail to
account for the intricacies and dynamics of travel behavior, leading to
less-than-optimal accuracy in these predictions. This study explores the
potential of deep learning techniques to transform the way we approach trip
predictions, and ultimately, transportation planning. Utilizing a comprehensive
dataset from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we developed and
trained a deep learning model for predicting person and vehicle trips. The
proposed model leverages the vast amount of information in the NHTS data,
capturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by
traditional models. As a result, our deep learning model achieved an impressive
accuracy of 98% for person trip prediction and 96% for vehicle trip estimation.
This represents a significant improvement over the performances of traditional
transportation planning models, thereby demonstrating the power of deep
learning in this domain. The implications of this study extend beyond just more
accurate predictions. By enhancing the accuracy and reliability of trip
prediction models, planners can formulate more effective, data-driven
transportation policies, infrastructure, and services. As such, our research
underscores the need for the transportation planning field to embrace advanced
techniques like deep learning. The detailed methodology, along with a thorough
discussion of the results and their implications, are presented in the
subsequent sections of this paper.

<p class="mathjax">The commonly adopted detect-then-match approach to registration finds
difficulties in the cross-modality cases due to the incompatible keypoint
detection and inconsistent feature description. We propose, 2D3D-MATR, a
detection-free method for accurate and robust registration between images and
point clouds. Our method adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline where it first
computes coarse correspondences between downsampled patches of the input image
and the point cloud and then extends them to form dense correspondences between
pixels and points within the patch region. The coarse-level patch matching is
based on transformer which jointly learns global contextual constraints with
self-attention and cross-modality correlations with cross-attention. To resolve
the scale ambiguity in patch matching, we construct a multi-scale pyramid for
each image patch and learn to find for each point patch the best matching image
patch at a proper resolution level. Extensive experiments on two public
benchmarks demonstrate that 2D3D-MATR outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
P2-Net by around $20$ percentage points on inlier ratio and over $10$ points on
registration recall. Our code and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">The task of retrieving already debunked narratives aims to detect stories
that have already been fact-checked. The successful detection of claims that
have already been debunked not only reduces the manual efforts of professional
fact-checkers but can also contribute to slowing the spread of misinformation.
Mainly due to the lack of readily available data, this is an understudied
problem, particularly when considering the cross-lingual task, i.e. the
retrieval of fact-checking articles in a language different from the language
of the online post being checked. This paper fills this gap by (i) creating a
novel dataset to enable research on cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked
narratives, using tweets as queries to a database of fact-checking articles;
(ii) presenting an extensive experiment to benchmark fine-tuned and
off-the-shelf multilingual pre-trained Transformer models for this task; and
(iii) proposing a novel multistage framework that divides this cross-lingual
debunk retrieval task into refinement and re-ranking stages. Results show that
the task of cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked narratives is
challenging and off-the-shelf Transformer models fail to outperform a strong
lexical-based baseline (BM25). Nevertheless, our multistage retrieval framework
is robust, outperforming BM25 in most scenarios and enabling cross-domain and
zero-shot learning, without significantly harming the model's performance.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, methods for skeleton-based human activity recognition have been
shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, these attack methods
require either the full knowledge of the victim (i.e. white-box attacks),
access to training data (i.e. transfer-based attacks) or frequent model queries
(i.e. black-box attacks). All their requirements are highly restrictive,
raising the question of how detrimental the vulnerability is. In this paper, we
show that the vulnerability indeed exists. To this end, we consider a new
attack task: the attacker has no access to the victim model or the training
data or labels, where we coin the term hard no-box attack. Specifically, we
first learn a motion manifold where we define an adversarial loss to compute a
new gradient for the attack, named skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient. Our
gradient contains information of the motion dynamics, which is different from
existing gradient-based attack methods that compute the loss gradient assuming
each dimension in the data is independent. The SMI gradient can augment many
gradient-based attack methods, leading to a new family of no-box attack
methods. Extensive evaluation and comparison show that our method imposes a
real threat to existing classifiers. They also show that the SMI gradient
improves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial samples in
both no-box and transfer-based black-box settings.

<p class="mathjax">Strong stability is a property of time integration schemes for ODEs that
preserve temporal monotonicity of solutions in arbitrary (inner product) norms.
It is proved that explicit Runge--Kutta schemes of order $p\in 4\mathbb{N}$
with $s=p$ stages for linear autonomous ODE systems are not strongly stable,
closing an open stability question from [Z.~Sun and C.-W.~Shu, SIAM J. Numer.
Anal. 57 (2019), 1158--1182]. Furthermore, for explicit Runge--Kutta methods of
order $p\in\mathbb{N}$ and $s&gt;p$ stages, we prove several sufficient as well as
necessary conditions for strong stability. These conditions involve both the
stability function and the hypocoercivity index of the ODE system matrix. This
index is a structural property combining the Hermitian and skew-Hermitian part
of the system matrix.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed machine learning (DML) technology makes it possible to train
large neural networks in a reasonable amount of time. Meanwhile, as the
computing power grows much faster than network capacity, network communication
has gradually become the bottleneck of DML. Current multi-tenant GPU clusters
face network contention caused by hash-collision problem which not only further
increases the overhead of communication, but also creates unfairness and
affects the user experience. In this paper, we firstly analyse how network
contention affects the training time in a cluster with 32 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.
Then we propose vClos to eliminate network contention by jointly optimizing
network topology and communication pattern in distributed training. An
OCS-vClos which introduces a layer of optical circuit switches (OCSs) in the
leaf-spine network is also proposed to reduce potential network resource
fragmentation caused by resource allocation strategy in vClos. Testbed
experiments and real-trace-based large-scale simulations are conducted to
demonstrate the superiority of vClos over existing network resource scheduling
strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang (2017) introduced the pebbling comonad for
k-variable counting logic and thereby initiated a line of work that imports
category theoretic machinery to finite model theory. Such game comonads have
been developed for various logics, yielding characterisations of logical
equivalences in terms of isomorphisms in the associated co-Kleisli category. We
show a first limitation of this approach by studying linear-algebraic logic,
which is strictly more expressive than first-order counting logic and whose
k-variable logical equivalence relations are known as invertible-map
equivalences (IM). We show that there exists no finite-rank comonad on the
category of graphs whose co-Kleisli isomorphisms characterise IM-equivalence,
answering a question of \'O Conghaile and Dawar (CSL 2021). We obtain this
result by ruling out a characterisation of IM-equivalence in terms of
homomorphism indistinguishability and employing the Lov\'asz-type theorems for
game comonads established by Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio (2021). Two graphs are
homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class if they admit the same number
of homomorphisms from every graph in the class. The IM-equivalences cannot be
characterised in this way, neither when counting homomorphisms in the natural
numbers, nor in any finite prime field.

<p class="mathjax">Training large language models (LLMs) with open-domain instruction data has
yielded remarkable success in aligning to end tasks and user preferences.
Extensive research has highlighted that enhancing the quality and diversity of
instruction data consistently improves performance. However, the impact of data
complexity, as a crucial metric, remains relatively unexplored in three
aspects: (1) scaling law, where the sustainability of performance improvements
with increasing complexity is uncertain, (2) additional tokens, whether the
improvement brought by complexity comes from introducing more training tokens,
and (3) curriculum tuning, where the potential advantages of incorporating
instructions ranging from easy to difficult are not yet fully understood. In
this paper, we propose \textit{tree-instruct} to systematically enhance the
complexity of instruction data in a controllable manner. This approach adds a
specified number of nodes into the instruction semantic tree, yielding new
instruction data based on the modified tree. By adjusting the number of added
nodes, we can control the difficulty level in the modified instruction data.
Our preliminary experiments reveal the following insights: (1) Increasing
complexity consistently leads to sustained performance improvements. For
instance, using 1,000 instruction data and 10 nodes resulted in a substantial
24\% increase in win rate. (2) Under the same token budget, a few complex
instructions outperform diverse yet simple instructions. (3) Curriculum
instruction tuning might not yield the anticipated results; focusing on
increasing complexity appears to be the key.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant interest in recent
years as a solution to address the challenges posed by sparse and noisy data in
recommender systems. Despite the growing number of SSL algorithms designed to
provide state-of-the-art performance in various recommendation scenarios (e.g.,
graph collaborative filtering, sequential recommendation, social
recommendation, KG-enhanced recommendation), there is still a lack of unified
frameworks that integrate recommendation algorithms across different domains.
Such a framework could serve as the cornerstone for self-supervised
recommendation algorithms, unifying the validation of existing methods and
driving the design of new ones. To address this gap, we introduce SSLRec, a
novel benchmark platform that provides a standardized, flexible, and
comprehensive framework for evaluating various SSL-enhanced recommenders. The
SSLRec library features a modular architecture that allows users to easily
evaluate state-of-the-art models and a complete set of data augmentation and
self-supervised toolkits to help create SSL recommendation models with specific
needs. Furthermore, SSLRec simplifies the process of training and evaluating
different recommendation models with consistent and fair settings. Our SSLRec
platform covers a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art SSL-enhanced
recommendation models across different scenarios, enabling researchers to
evaluate these cutting-edge models and drive further innovation in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Many of us make quick decisions that affect our data privacy on our
smartphones without due consideration of our values. One such decision point is
establishing whether to download a smartphone app or not. In this work, we aim
to better understand the relationship between our values, our privacy
preferences, and our app choices, as well as explore the effectiveness of a
smartphone value-centered privacy assistant (VcPA) at promoting value-centered
app selection. To do this, we conducted a mixed-methods study that involved two
phases. The first was an online survey of 273 smartphone user's values and
privacy preferences when considering whether to download one of two apps (Lose
It! and OpenLitterMap). Our results suggest that values and privacy preferences
are related in an app or context-dependent manner. The second phase was testing
the VcPA with 77 users in a synthetic Mock App Store setting. We established
usability of a VcPA, with the VcPA helping some users more than others with
selecting apps consistent with their selected value profile. Future qualitative
and context-specific explorations of user perspectives could contribute to
adequately capturing the specific role of values for privacy decision-making
and improving the VcPA.

driving. While autonomous vehicles demonstrate high performance in closed-set
conditions, they encounter difficulties when confronted with unexpected
situations. At the same time, world models emerged in the field of model-based
reinforcement learning as a way to enable agents to predict the future
depending on potential actions. This led to outstanding results in sparse
reward and complex control tasks. This work provides an overview of how world
models can be leveraged to perform anomaly detection in the domain of
autonomous driving. We provide a characterization of world models and relate
individual components to previous works in anomaly detection to facilitate
further research in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Discovering causal relations among semantic factors is an emergent topic in
representation learning. Most causal representation learning (CRL) methods are
fully supervised, which is impractical due to costly labeling. To resolve this
restriction, weakly supervised CRL methods were introduced. To evaluate CRL
performance, four existing datasets, Pendulum, Flow, CelebA(BEARD) and
CelebA(SMILE), are utilized. However, existing CRL datasets are limited to
simple graphs with few generative factors. Thus we propose two new datasets
with a larger number of diverse generative factors and more sophisticated
causal graphs. In addition, current real datasets, CelebA(BEARD) and
CelebA(SMILE), the originally proposed causal graphs are not aligned with the
dataset distributions. Thus, we propose modifications to them.

<p class="mathjax">Critical points mark locations in the domain where the level-set topology of
a scalar function undergoes fundamental changes and thus indicate potentially
interesting features in the data. Established methods exist to locate and
relate such points in a deterministic setting, but it is less well understood
how the concept of critical points can be extended to the analysis of uncertain
data. Most methods for this task aim at finding likely locations of critical
points or estimate the probability of their occurrence locally but do not
indicate if critical points at potentially different locations in different
realizations of a stochastic process are manifestations of the same feature,
which is required to characterize the spatial uncertainty of critical points.
Previous work on relating critical points across different realizations
reported challenges for interpreting the resulting spatial distribution of
critical points but did not investigate the causes. In this work, we provide a
mathematical formulation of the problem of finding critical points with spatial
uncertainty and computing their spatial distribution, which leads us to the
notion of uncertain critical points. We analyze the theoretical properties of
these structures and highlight connections to existing works for special
classes of uncertain fields. We derive conditions under which
well-interpretable results can be obtained and discuss the implications of
those restrictions for the field of visualization. We demonstrate that the
discussed limitations are not purely academic but also arise in real-world
data.

<p class="mathjax">CNNs and Transformers have their own advantages and both have been widely
used for dense prediction in multi-task learning (MTL). Most of the current
studies on MTL solely rely on CNN or Transformer. In this work, we present a
novel MTL model by combining both merits of deformable CNN and query-based
Transformer with shared gating for multi-task learning of dense prediction.
This combination may offer a simple and efficient solution owing to its
powerful and flexible task-specific learning and advantages of lower cost, less
complexity and smaller parameters than the traditional MTL methods. We
introduce deformable mixer Transformer with gating (DeMTG), a simple and
effective encoder-decoder architecture up-to-date that incorporates the
convolution and attention mechanism in a unified network for MTL. It is
exquisitely designed to use advantages of each block, and provide deformable
and comprehensive features for all tasks from local and global perspective.
First, the deformable mixer encoder contains two types of operators: the
channel-aware mixing operator leveraged to allow communication among different
channels, and the spatial-aware deformable operator with deformable convolution
applied to efficiently sample more informative spatial locations. Second, the
task-aware gating transformer decoder is used to perform the task-specific
predictions, in which task interaction block integrated with self-attention is
applied to capture task interaction features, and the task query block
integrated with gating attention is leveraged to select corresponding
task-specific features. Further, the experiment results demonstrate that the
proposed DeMTG uses fewer GFLOPs and significantly outperforms current
Transformer-based and CNN-based competitive models on a variety of metrics on
three dense prediction datasets. Our code and models are available at
https://github.com/yangyangxu0/DeMTG.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning training training algorithms are a huge success in recent years
in many fields including speech, text,image video etc. Deeper and deeper layers
are proposed with huge success with resnet structures having around 152 layers.
Shallow convolution neural networks(CNN's) are still an active research, where
some phenomena are still unexplained. Activation functions used in the network
are of utmost importance, as they provide non linearity to the networks. Relu's
are the most commonly used activation function.We show a complex piece-wise
linear(PWL) activation in the hidden layer. We show that these PWL activations
work much better than relu activations in our networks for convolution neural
networks and multilayer perceptrons. Result comparison in PyTorch for shallow
and deep CNNs are given to further strengthen our case.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work has shown that it is possible to resynthesize high-quality speech
based, not on text, but on low bitrate discrete units that have been learned in
a self-supervised fashion and can therefore capture expressive aspects of
speech that are hard to transcribe (prosody, voice styles, non-verbal
vocalization). The adoption of these methods is still limited by the fact that
most speech synthesis datasets are read, severely limiting spontaneity and
expressivity. Here, we introduce Expresso, a high-quality expressive speech
dataset for textless speech synthesis that includes both read speech and
improvised dialogues rendered in 26 spontaneous expressive styles. We
illustrate the challenges and potentials of this dataset with an expressive
resynthesis benchmark where the task is to encode the input in low-bitrate
units and resynthesize it in a target voice while preserving content and style.
We evaluate resynthesis quality with automatic metrics for different
self-supervised discrete encoders, and explore tradeoffs between quality,
bitrate and invariance to speaker and style. All the dataset, evaluation
metrics and baseline models are open source

<p class="mathjax">Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and
freight mobility. Besides the enormous challenge of perception, i.e. accurately
perceiving the environment using available sensor data, automated driving
comprises planning a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To
promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future
motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly
handle prediction and planning as sequential separate tasks. While this
accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego-vehicle, it fails
to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego-vehicle's
behavior. Recent works suggest that integrating prediction and planning in an
interdependent joint step is necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and
comfortable driving. While various models implement such integrated systems, a
comprehensive overview and theoretical understanding of different principles
are lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based
prediction, planning, and integrated prediction and planning models. Different
facets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to
behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we
discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration
methods. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges,
and highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions
for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in
science and engineering. Recently, mostly due to the high computational cost of
traditional solution techniques, deep neural network based surrogates have
gained increased interest. The practical utility of such neural PDE solvers
relies on their ability to provide accurate, stable predictions over long time
horizons, which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we present a
large-scale analysis of common temporal rollout strategies, identifying the
neglect of non-dominant spatial frequency information, often associated with
high frequencies in PDE solutions, as the primary pitfall limiting stable,
accurate rollout performance. Based on these insights, we draw inspiration from
recent advances in diffusion models to introduce PDE-Refiner; a novel model
class that enables more accurate modeling of all frequency components via a
multistep refinement process. We validate PDE-Refiner on challenging benchmarks
of complex fluid dynamics, demonstrating stable and accurate rollouts that
consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including neural, numerical,
and hybrid neural-numerical architectures. We further demonstrate that
PDE-Refiner greatly enhances data efficiency, since the denoising objective
implicitly induces a novel form of spectral data augmentation. Finally,
PDE-Refiner's connection to diffusion models enables an accurate and efficient
assessment of the model's predictive uncertainty, allowing us to estimate when
the surrogate becomes inaccurate.

<p class="mathjax">3D scene reconstruction is a long-standing vision task. Existing approaches
can be categorized into geometry-based and learning-based methods. The former
leverages multi-view geometry but can face catastrophic failures due to the
reliance on accurate pixel correspondence across views. The latter was
proffered to mitigate these issues by learning 2D or 3D representation
directly. However, without a large-scale video or 3D training data, it can
hardly generalize to diverse real-world scenarios due to the presence of tens
of millions or even billions of optimization parameters in the deep network.
Recently, robust monocular depth estimation models trained with large-scale
datasets have been proven to possess weak 3D geometry prior, but they are
insufficient for reconstruction due to the unknown camera parameters, the
affine-invariant property, and inter-frame inconsistency. Here, we propose a
novel test-time optimization approach that can transfer the robustness of
affine-invariant depth models such as LeReS to challenging diverse scenes while
ensuring inter-frame consistency, with only dozens of parameters to optimize
per video frame. Specifically, our approach involves freezing the pre-trained
affine-invariant depth model's depth predictions, rectifying them by optimizing
the unknown scale-shift values with a geometric consistency alignment module,
and employing the resulting scale-consistent depth maps to robustly obtain
camera poses and achieve dense scene reconstruction, even in low-texture
regions. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-dataset reconstruction on five zero-shot testing datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Although audio generation shares commonalities across different types of
audio, such as speech, music, and sound effects, designing models for each type
requires careful consideration of specific objectives and biases that can
significantly differ from those of other types. To bring us closer to a unified
perspective of audio generation, this paper proposes a framework that utilizes
the same learning method for speech, music, and sound effect generation. Our
framework introduces a general representation of audio, called language of
audio (LOA). Any audio can be translated into LOA based on AudioMAE, a
self-supervised pre-trained representation learning model. In the generation
process, we translate any modalities into LOA by using a GPT-2 model, and we
perform self-supervised audio generation learning with a latent diffusion model
conditioned on LOA. The proposed framework naturally brings advantages such as
in-context learning abilities and reusable self-supervised pretrained AudioMAE
and latent diffusion models. Experiments on the major benchmarks of
text-to-audio, text-to-music, and text-to-speech demonstrate new
state-of-the-art or competitive performance to previous approaches. Our demo
and code are available at https://audioldm.github.io/audioldm2.

<p class="mathjax">High-definition (HD) map provides abundant and precise static environmental
information of the driving scene, serving as a fundamental and indispensable
component for planning in autonomous driving system. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Map} \textbf{TR}ansformer, an end-to-end framework for online
vectorized HD map construction. We propose a unified permutation-equivalent
modeling approach, \ie, modeling map element as a point set with a group of
equivalent permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element
and stabilizes the learning process. We design a hierarchical query embedding
scheme to flexibly encode structured map information and perform hierarchical
bipartite matching for map element learning. To speed up convergence, we
further introduce auxiliary one-to-many matching and dense supervision. The
proposed method well copes with various map elements with arbitrary shapes. It
runs at real-time inference speed and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Abundant qualitative results show stable
and robust map construction quality in complex and various driving scenes. Code
and more demos are available at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/MapTR} for
facilitating further studies and applications.

<p class="mathjax">Tracking and following objects of interest is critical to several robotics
use cases, ranging from industrial automation to logistics and warehousing, to
healthcare and security. In this paper, we present a robotic system to detect,
track, and follow any object in real-time. Our approach, dubbed ``follow
anything'' (FAn), is an open-vocabulary and multimodal model -- it is not
restricted to concepts seen at training time and can be applied to novel
classes at inference time using text, images, or click queries. Leveraging rich
visual descriptors from large-scale pre-trained models (foundation models), FAn
can detect and segment objects by matching multimodal queries (text, images,
clicks) against an input image sequence. These detected and segmented objects
are tracked across image frames, all while accounting for occlusion and object
re-emergence. We demonstrate FAn on a real-world robotic system (a micro aerial
vehicle) and report its ability to seamlessly follow the objects of interest in
a real-time control loop. FAn can be deployed on a laptop with a lightweight
(6-8 GB) graphics card, achieving a throughput of 6-20 frames per second. To
enable rapid adoption, deployment, and extensibility, we open-source all our
code on our project webpage at https://github.com/alaamaalouf/FollowAnything .

<p class="mathjax">Gradient-based optimization is now ubiquitous across graphics, but
unfortunately can not be applied to problems with undefined or zero gradients.
To circumvent this issue, the loss function can be manually replaced by a
"surrogate" that has similar minima but is differentiable. Our proposed
framework, ZeroGrads, automates this process by learning a neural approximation
of the objective function, the surrogate, which in turn can be used to
differentiate through arbitrary black-box graphics pipelines. We train the
surrogate on an actively smoothed version of the objective and encourage
locality, focusing the surrogate's capacity on what matters at the current
training episode. The fitting is performed online, alongside the parameter
optimization, and self-supervised, without pre-computed data or pre-trained
models. As sampling the objective is expensive (it requires a full rendering or
simulator run), we devise an efficient sampling scheme that allows for
tractable run-times and competitive performance at little overhead. We
demonstrate optimizing diverse non-convex, non-differentiable black-box
problems in graphics, such as visibility in rendering, discrete parameter
spaces in procedural modelling or optimal control in physics-driven animation.
In contrast to more traditional algorithms, our approach scales well to higher
dimensions, which we demonstrate on problems with up to 35k interlinked
variables.

<p class="mathjax">The recent proliferation of 3D content that can be consumed on hand-held
devices necessitates efficient tools for transmitting large geometric data,
e.g., 3D meshes, over the Internet. Detailed high-resolution assets can pose a
challenge to storage as well as transmission bandwidth, and level-of-detail
techniques are often used to transmit an asset using an appropriate bandwidth
budget. It is especially desirable for these methods to transmit data
progressively, improving the quality of the geometry with more data. Our key
insight is that the geometric details of 3D meshes often exhibit similar local
patterns even across different shapes, and thus can be effectively represented
with a shared learned generative space. We learn this space using a
subdivision-based encoder-decoder architecture trained in advance on a large
collection of surfaces. We further observe that additional residual features
can be transmitted progressively between intermediate levels of subdivision
that enable the client to control the tradeoff between bandwidth cost and
quality of reconstruction, providing a neural progressive mesh representation.
We evaluate our method on a diverse set of complex 3D shapes and demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction
quality.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we develop a new method to automatically convert 2D line
drawings from three orthographic views into 3D CAD models. Existing methods for
this problem reconstruct 3D models by back-projecting the 2D observations into
3D space while maintaining explicit correspondence between the input and
output. Such methods are sensitive to errors and noises in the input, thus
often fail in practice where the input drawings created by human designers are
imperfect. To overcome this difficulty, we leverage the attention mechanism in
a Transformer-based sequence generation model to learn flexible mappings
between the input and output. Further, we design shape programs which are
suitable for generating the objects of interest to boost the reconstruction
accuracy and facilitate CAD modeling applications. Experiments on a new
benchmark dataset show that our method significantly outperforms existing ones
when the inputs are noisy or incomplete.

<p class="mathjax">In this work we present a novel optimization strategy for image
reconstruction tasks under analysis-based image regularization, which promotes
sparse and/or low-rank solutions in some learned transform domain. We
parameterize such regularizers using potential functions that correspond to
weighted extensions of the $\ell_p^p$-vector and $\mathcal{S}_p^p$
Schatten-matrix quasi-norms with $0 &lt; p \le 1$. Our proposed minimization
strategy extends the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method,
typically used for synthesis-based $\ell_p$ and $\mathcal{S}_p$ norm and
analysis-based $\ell_1$ and nuclear norm regularization. We prove that under
mild conditions our minimization algorithm converges linearly to a stationary
point, and we provide an upper bound for its convergence rate. Further, to
select the parameters of the regularizers that deliver the best results for the
problem at hand, we propose to learn them from training data by formulating the
supervised learning process as a stochastic bilevel optimization problem. We
show that thanks to the convergence guarantees of our proposed minimization
strategy, such optimization can be successfully performed with a
memory-efficient implicit back-propagation scheme. We implement our learned
IRLS variants as recurrent networks and assess their performance on the
challenging image reconstruction tasks of non-blind deblurring,
super-resolution and demosaicking. The comparisons against other existing
learned reconstruction approaches demonstrate that our overall method is very
competitive and in many cases outperforms existing unrolled networks, whose
number of parameters is orders of magnitude higher than in our case.

<p class="mathjax">Lesion segmentation of ultrasound medical images based on deep learning
techniques is a widely used method for diagnosing diseases. Although there is a
large amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places,
labeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no
datasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the
possibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural
images that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant
features that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration
between ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of
public datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source
domains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,
and there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,
which may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial
transfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed.
Specifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial
transfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a
certain pair of source and target domains, which provides the possibility to
utilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a
single source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse
knowledge from multiple source domains. In order to ensure the effectiveness of
the fusion and maximize the use of precious data, a multi-source domain
independent strategy is also proposed to improve the estimation of the target
domain data distribution, which further increases the learning ability of the
multi-source adversarial migration learning network in multiple domains.

<p class="mathjax">Phosphorylation is central to numerous fundamental cellular processes,
influencing the onset and progression of a variety of diseases. Identification
of phosphorylation sites is thus an important step for understanding the
molecular mechanisms of cells and virus infection, which potentially leads to
new therapeutic targets. In this study, we present PTransIPs, a novel deep
learning model for the identification of phosphorylation sites. PTransIPs
treats amino acids in protein sequences as words in natural language,
extracting unique encodings based on the types along with position of amino
acids in the sequence. It also incorporates embeddings from large pre-trained
protein models as additional data inputs. PTransIPS is further trained on a
combination model of convolutional neural network with residual connections and
Transformer model equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms. At last, the
model outputs classification results through a fully connected layer. The
results of independent testing reveal that PTransIPs outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving AUROCs of 0.9232 and 0.9660 for
identifying phosphorylated S/T and Y sites respectively. In addition, ablation
studies prove that pretrained model embeddings contribute to the performance of
PTransIPs. Furthermore, PTransIPs has interpretable amino acid preference,
visible training process and shows generalizability on other bioactivity
classification tasks. To facilitate usage, our code and data are publicly
accessible at \url{https://github.com/StatXzy7/PTransIPs}.

<p class="mathjax">This paper demonstrates the utility of organized numerical representations of
genes in research involving flat string gene formats (i.e., FASTA/FASTQ5).
FASTA/FASTQ files have several current limitations, such as their large file
sizes, slow processing speeds for mapping and alignment, and contextual
dependencies. These challenges significantly hinder investigations and tasks
that involve finding similar sequences. The solution lies in transforming
sequences into an alternative representation that facilitates easier clustering
into similar groups compared to the raw sequences themselves. By assigning a
unique vector embedding to each short sequence, it is possible to more
efficiently cluster and improve upon compression performance for the string
representations of cDNA libraries. Furthermore, through learning alternative
coordinate vector embeddings based on the contexts of codon triplets, we can
demonstrate clustering based on amino acid properties. Finally, using this
sequence embedding method to encode barcodes and cDNA sequences, we can improve
the time complexity of the similarity search by coupling vector embeddings with
an algorithm that determines the proximity of vectors in Euclidean space; this
allows us to perform sequence similarity searches in a quicker and more modular
fashion.

<p class="mathjax">The multifactorial etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that
its study would benefit greatly from multimodal approaches that combine data
from widely varying platforms, e.g., neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical
characterization. Prior neuroimaging-genetic analyses often apply naive feature
concatenation approaches in data-driven work or use the findings from one
modality to guide posthoc analysis of another, missing the opportunity to
analyze the paired multimodal data in a truly unified approach. In this paper,
we develop a more integrative model for combining genetic, demographic, and
neuroimaging data. Inspired by the influence of genotype on phenotype, we
propose using an attention-based approach where the genetic data guides
attention to neuroimaging features of importance for model prediction. The
genetic data is derived from copy number variation parameters, while the
neuroimaging data is from functional magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluate
the proposed approach on ASD classification and severity prediction tasks,
using a sex-balanced dataset of 228 ASD and typically developing subjects in a
10-fold cross-validation framework. We demonstrate that our attention-based
model combining genetic information, demographic data, and functional magnetic
resonance imaging results in superior prediction performance compared to other
multimodal approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Manually grading structural changes with the modified Stoke Ankylosing
Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) on spinal X-ray imaging is costly and
time-consuming due to bone shape complexity and image quality variations. In
this study, we address this challenge by prototyping a 2-step auto-grading
pipeline, called VertXGradeNet, to automatically predict mSASSS scores for the
cervical and lumbar vertebral units (VUs) in X-ray spinal imaging. The
VertXGradeNet utilizes VUs generated by our previously developed VU extraction
pipeline (VertXNet) as input and predicts mSASSS based on those VUs.
VertXGradeNet was evaluated on an in-house dataset of lateral cervical and
lumbar X-ray images for axial spondylarthritis patients. Our results show that
VertXGradeNet can predict the mSASSS score for each VU when the data is limited
in quantity and imbalanced. Overall, it can achieve a balanced accuracy of 0.56
and 0.51 for 4 different mSASSS scores (i.e., a score of 0, 1, 2, 3) on two
test datasets. The accuracy of the presented method shows the potential to
streamline the spinal radiograph readings and therefore reduce the cost of
future clinical trials.

<p class="mathjax">The capacity to identify and analyze protein-protein interactions, along with
their internal modular organization, plays a crucial role in comprehending the
intricate mechanisms underlying biological processes at the molecular level. We
can learn a lot about the structure and dynamics of these interactions by using
network analysis. We can improve our understanding of the biological roots of
disease pathogenesis by recognizing network communities. This knowledge, in
turn, holds significant potential for driving advancements in drug discovery
and facilitating personalized medicine approaches for disease treatment. In
this study, we aimed to uncover the communities within the variant B.1.1.529
(Omicron virus) using two proposed novel algorithm (ABCDE and ALCDE) and four
widely recognized algorithms: Girvan-Newman, Louvain, Leiden, and Label
Propagation algorithm. Each of these algorithms has established prominence in
the field and offers unique perspectives on identifying communities within
complex networks. We also compare the networks by the global properties,
statistic summary, subgraph count, graphlet and validate by the modulaity. By
employing these approaches, we sought to gain deeper insights into the
structural organization and interconnections present within the Omicron virus

<p class="mathjax">While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in the medical
field, the causes of differences in prediction performance are often unknown.
This lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the efficacy of bias
mitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset balancing still often
performs best in reducing performance gaps but is unable to resolve all
performance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes of gender bias
in machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis. In particular, we explore the
hypothesis that breast tissue leads to underexposure of the lungs and causes
lower model performance. Methodologically, we propose a new sampling method
which addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings per patient in two
widely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing the impact of
label errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences across diseases,
datasets, and gender representations in the training set shows that dataset
imbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences. Moreover, relative
group performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating important
dataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance. Finally, we
investigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by cropping out the
breasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve the observed
performance gaps. In conclusion, our results indicate that dataset-specific
factors, not fundamental physiological differences, are the main drivers of
male--female performance gaps in chest X-ray analyses on widely used NIH and
CheXpert Dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The primary method for identifying mental disorders automatically has
traditionally involved using binary classifiers. These classifiers are trained
using behavioral data obtained from an interview setup. In this training
process, data from individuals with the specific disorder under consideration
are categorized as the positive class, while data from all other participants
constitute the negative class. In practice, it is widely recognized that
certain mental disorders share similar symptoms, causing the collected
behavioral data to encompass a variety of attributes associated with multiple
disorders. Consequently, attributes linked to the targeted mental disorder
might also be present within the negative class. This data impurity may lead to
sub-optimal training of the classifier for a mental disorder of interest. In
this study, we investigate this hypothesis in the context of major depressive
disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder detection (PTSD). The results
show that upon removal of such data impurity, MDD and PTSD detection
performances are significantly improved.

<p class="mathjax">The forces acting on bridge structural elements caused by live loads are
computed by live load models defined in design codes. In most cases, such live
load models are defined by studies performed on girder bridges, where extreme
values of shear forces and bending moment are intended to be predicted. This
paper shows that when code live load models are applied to truss bridges, the
estimated forces in some structural elements may not be representative of those
caused by actual traffic. Three WIM (weigh-in-motion) databases, which are
recorded on roads in Mexico, are used as real traffic data. The results suggest
that current code live load models are not entirely adequate to estimate forces
in structural elements of truss bridges.

<p class="mathjax">The present work discusses the use of a weakly-supervised deep learning
algorithm that reduces the cost of labelling pixel-level masks for complex
radio galaxies with multiple components. The algorithm is trained on weak
class-level labels of radio galaxies to get class activation maps (CAMs). The
CAMs are further refined using an inter-pixel relations network (IRNet) to get
instance segmentation masks over radio galaxies and the positions of their
infrared hosts. We use data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, specifically the Evolutionary Map of the Universe
(EMU) Pilot Survey, which covered a sky area of 270 square degrees with an RMS
sensitivity of 25-35 $\mu$Jy/beam. We demonstrate that weakly-supervised deep
learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy in predicting pixel-level
information, including masks for the extended radio emission encapsulating all
galaxy components and the positions of the infrared host galaxies. We evaluate
the performance of our method using mean Average Precision (mAP) across
multiple classes at a standard intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5.
We show that the model achieves a mAP$_{50}$ of 67.5\% and 76.8\% for radio
masks and infrared host positions, respectively. The network architecture can

<p class="mathjax">Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and
unpredictable seizures, necessitating accurate prediction for effective
management and patient care. Application of machine learning (ML) on
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, along with its ability to provide
valuable insights into brain activity during seizures, is able to make accurate
and robust seizure prediction an indispensable component in relevant studies.
In this research, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of five
machine learning models - Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Extra Trees
(ET), Logistic Regression (LR), and Gradient Boosting (GB) - for the prediction
of epileptic seizures using EEG data. The dataset underwent meticulous
preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, outlier handling, and
oversampling, ensuring data quality and facilitating accurate model training.
These preprocessing techniques played a crucial role in enhancing the models'
performance. The results of our analysis demonstrate the performance of each
model in terms of accuracy. The LR classifier achieved an accuracy of 56.95%,
while GB and DT both attained 97.17% accuracy. RT achieved a higher accuracy of
98.99%, while the ET model exhibited the best performance with an accuracy of
99.29%. Our findings reveal that the ET model outperformed not only the other
models in the comparative analysis but also surpassed the state-of-the-art
results from previous research. The superior performance of the ET model makes
it a compelling choice for accurate and robust epileptic seizure prediction
using EEG data.

level of sugar in the blood, which causes the retinal capillaries to block and
bleed, causing retinal tissue damage. It usually results in blindness. Early
detection can help in lowering the risk of DR and its severity. The robust and

task. This paper develops a machine learning model for detecting Diabetic
Retinopathy that is entirely accurate. Pre-trained models such as ResNet50,

<p class="mathjax">Optics is an exciting route for the next generation of computing hardware for
machine learning, promising several orders of magnitude enhancement in both
computational speed and energy efficiency. However, to reach the full capacity
of an optical neural network it is necessary that the computing not only for
the inference, but also for the training be implemented optically. The primary
algorithm for training a neural network is backpropagation, in which the
calculation is performed in the order opposite to the information flow for
inference. While straightforward in a digital computer, optical implementation
of backpropagation has so far remained elusive, particularly because of the
conflicting requirements for the optical element that implements the nonlinear
activation function. In this work, we address this challenge for the first time
with a surprisingly simple and generic scheme. Saturable absorbers are employed
for the role of the activation units, and the required properties are achieved
through a pump-probe process, in which the forward propagating signal acts as
the pump and backward as the probe. Our approach is adaptable to various analog
platforms, materials, and network structures, and it demonstrates the
possibility of constructing neural networks entirely reliant on analog optical
processes for both training and inference tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In this research, a comparative study of four Quantum Machine Learning (QML)
models was conducted for fraud detection in finance. We proved that the Quantum
Support Vector Classifier model achieved the highest performance, with F1
scores of 0.98 for fraud and non-fraud classes. Other models like the
Variational Quantum Classifier, Estimator Quantum Neural Network (QNN), and
Sampler QNN demonstrate promising results, propelling the potential of QML
classification for financial applications. While they exhibit certain
limitations, the insights attained pave the way for future enhancements and
optimisation strategies. However, challenges exist, including the need for more
efficient Quantum algorithms and larger and more complex datasets. The article
provides solutions to overcome current limitations and contributes new insights
to the field of Quantum Machine Learning in fraud detection, with important
implications for its future development.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation is an important step in medical image analysis,
especially as a crucial prerequisite for efficient disease diagnosis and
treatment. The use of deep learning for image segmentation has become a
prevalent trend. The widely adopted approach currently is U-Net and its
variants. Additionally, with the remarkable success of pre-trained models in
natural language processing tasks, transformer-based models like TransUNet have
achieved desirable performance on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.
In this paper, we conduct a survey of the most representative four medical
image segmentation models in recent years. We theoretically analyze the
characteristics of these models and quantitatively evaluate their performance
on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Tuberculosis Chest X-rays and ovarian tumors).
Finally, we discuss the main challenges and future trends in medical image
segmentation. Our work can assist researchers in the related field to quickly
establish medical segmentation models tailored to specific regions.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins encode rich biological
information and have been workhorses in bioinformatic methods for tasks like
protein design and protein structure prediction for decades. Recent
breakthroughs like AlphaFold2 that use transformers to attend directly over
large quantities of raw MSAs have reaffirmed their importance. Generation of
MSAs is highly computationally intensive, however, and no datasets comparable
to those used to train AlphaFold2 have been made available to the research
community, hindering progress in machine learning for proteins. To remedy this
problem, we introduce OpenProteinSet, an open-source corpus of more than 16
million MSAs, associated structural homologs from the Protein Data Bank, and
AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions. We have previously demonstrated the
utility of OpenProteinSet by successfully retraining AlphaFold2 on it. We
expect OpenProteinSet to be broadly useful as training and validation data for
1) diverse tasks focused on protein structure, function, and design and 2)
large-scale multimodal machine learning research.

<p class="mathjax">To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) images while
minimizing radiation exposure, various methods have been proposed for
reconstructing standard-dose PET (SPET) images from low-dose PET (LPET)
sinograms directly. However, current methods often neglect boundaries during
sinogram-to-image reconstruction, resulting in high-frequency distortion in the
frequency domain and diminished or fuzzy edges in the reconstructed images.
Furthermore, the convolutional architectures, which are commonly used, lack the
ability to model long-range non-local interactions, potentially leading to
inaccurate representations of global structures. To alleviate these problems,
we propose a transformer-based model that unites triple domains of sinogram,
image, and frequency for direct PET reconstruction, namely TriDo-Former.
Specifically, the TriDo-Former consists of two cascaded networks, i.e., a
sinogram enhancement transformer (SE-Former) for denoising the input LPET
sinograms and a spatial-spectral reconstruction transformer (SSR-Former) for
reconstructing SPET images from the denoised sinograms. Different from the
vanilla transformer that splits an image into 2D patches, based specifically on
the PET imaging mechanism, our SE-Former divides the sinogram into 1D
projection view angles to maintain its inner-structure while denoising,
preventing the noise in the sinogram from prorogating into the image domain.
Moreover, to mitigate high-frequency distortion and improve reconstruction
details, we integrate global frequency parsers (GFPs) into SSR-Former. The GFP
serves as a learnable frequency filter that globally adjusts the frequency
components in the frequency domain, enforcing the network to restore
high-frequency details resembling real SPET images. Validations on a clinical
dataset demonstrate that our TriDo-Former outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

coupling operator in many engineering applications is nonlinear. In this
letter, we propose a generalized primal-dual correction method (GPD-CM) to
handle SPPs with a nonlinear coupling operator. To achieve this, we customize
the proximal matrix and corrective matrix by adjusting the values of
regularization factors. By the unified framework, the convergence of GPD-CM is
directly obtained. Numerical results on a SPP with an exponential coupling

<p class="mathjax">This paper compares the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance between the
fully-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) sensing versus its semi-passive counterpart. In particular, we consider
a basic setup with one base station (BS), one uniform linear array (ULA) IRS,
and one point target at the BS's NLoS region, in which the BS and the IRS
jointly design the transmit and reflective beamforming for performance
optimization. By considering two special cases with the BS-IRS channels being
line-of-sight (LoS) and Rayleigh fading, respectively, we derive the
corresponding asymptotic sensing SNR when the number of reflecting elements $N$
at the IRS becomes sufficiently large. It is revealed that in the two special
cases, the sensing SNR increases proportional to $N^2$ for the semi-passive IRS
sensing system, but proportional to $N^4$ for the fully-passive IRS sensing
system. As such, the fully-passive IRS sensing system is shown to outperform
the semi-passive counterpart when $N$ becomes large, which is due to the fact
that the fully-passive IRS sensing enjoys additional reflective beamforming
gain from the IRS to the BS that outweighs the resultant path loss in this
case. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate our analysis under
different transmit and reflective beamforming design schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Soft dynamic time warping (SDTW) is a differentiable loss function that
allows for training neural networks from weakly aligned data. Typically, SDTW
is used to iteratively compute and refine soft alignments that compensate for
temporal deviations between the training data and its weakly annotated targets.
One major problem is that a mismatch between the estimated soft alignments and
the reference alignments in the early training stage leads to incorrect
parameter updates, making the overall training procedure unstable. In this
paper, we investigate such stability issues by considering the task of pitch
class estimation from music recordings as an illustrative case study. In
particular, we introduce and discuss three conceptually different strategies (a
hyperparameter scheduling, a diagonal prior, and a sequence unfolding strategy)
with the objective of stabilizing intermediate soft alignment results. Finally,
we report on experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies
and discuss efficiency and implementation issues.

<p class="mathjax">Ultrasound (US) imaging is better suited for intraoperative settings because
it is real-time and more portable than other imaging techniques, such as
mammography. However, US images are characterized by lower spatial resolution
noise-like artifacts. This research aims to address these limitations by
providing surgeons with mammogram-like image quality in real-time from noisy US
images. Unlike previous approaches for improving US image quality that aim to
reduce artifacts by treating them as (speckle noise), we recognize their value
as informative wave interference pattern (WIP). To achieve this, we utilize the
Stride software to numerically solve the forward model, generating ultrasound
images from mammograms images by solving wave-equations. Additionally, we
leverage the power of domain adaptation to enhance the realism of the simulated
ultrasound images. Then, we utilize generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
tackle the inverse problem of generating mammogram-quality images from
ultrasound images. The resultant images have considerably more discernible
details than the original US images.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervision has been widely explored as a means of addressing the lack
of inductive biases in vision transformer architectures, which limits
generalisation when networks are trained on small datasets. This is crucial in
the context of cortical imaging, where phenotypes are complex and
heterogeneous, but the available datasets are limited in size. This paper
builds upon recent advancements in translating vision transformers to surface
meshes and investigates the potential of Masked AutoEncoder (MAE)
self-supervision for cortical surface learning. By reconstructing surface data
from a masked version of the input, the proposed method effectively models
cortical structure to learn strong representations that translate to improved
performance in downstream tasks. We evaluate our approach on cortical phenotype
regression using the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) and demonstrate
that pre-training leads to a 26\% improvement in performance, with an 80\%
faster convergence, compared to models trained from scratch. Furthermore, we
establish that pre-training vision transformer models on large datasets, such
as the UK Biobank (UKB), enables the acquisition of robust representations for
finetuning in low-data scenarios. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at \url{https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-vision-transformers}.

<p class="mathjax">Computational models of neurodegeneration aim to emulate the evolving pattern
of pathology in the brain during neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's
disease. Previous studies have made specific choices on the mechanisms of
pathology production and diffusion, or assume that all the subjects lie on the
same disease progression trajectory. However, the complexity and heterogeneity
of neurodegenerative pathology suggests that multiple mechanisms may contribute
synergistically with complex interactions, meanwhile the degree of contribution
of each mechanism may vary among individuals. We thus put forward a
coupled-mechanisms modelling framework which non-linearly combines the
network-topology-informed pathology appearance with the process of pathology
spreading within a dynamic modelling system. We account for the heterogeneity
of disease by fitting the model at the individual level, allowing the
epicenters and rate of progression to vary among subjects. We construct a
Bayesian model selection framework to account for feature importance and
parameter uncertainty. This provides a combination of mechanisms that best
explains the observations for each individual from the ADNI dataset. With the
obtained distribution of mechanism importance for each subject, we are able to
identify subgroups of patients sharing similar combinations of apparent
mechanisms.

<p class="mathjax">With the recent expansion of urban greening interventions, the definition of
spatial indicators to measure the provision of urban greenery has become of
pivotal importance in informing the policy-design process. By analyzing the
stability of the population and area rankings induced by several indicators of
green accessibility for over 1,000 cities worldwide, we investigate the extent
to which the use of a single metric provides a reliable assessment of green
accessibility in a city. The results suggest that, due to the complex
interaction between the spatial distribution of greenspaces in an urban center
and its population distribution, the use of a single indicator might lead to
insufficient discrimination across areas or subgroups of the population, even
when focusing on one form of green accessibility. From a policy perspective,
this indicates the need to switch toward a multi-dimensional framework that is
able to organically evaluate a range of indicators at once.

<p class="mathjax">This paper provides an overview of the historical progression of distributed
optimization techniques, tracing their development from early duality-based
methods pioneered by Dantzig, Wolfe, and Benders in the 1960s to the emergence
of the Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN)
algorithm. The initial focus on Lagrangian relaxation for convex problems and
decomposition strategies led to the refinement of methods like the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The resurgence of interest in
distributed optimization in the late 2000s, particularly in machine learning
and imaging, demonstrated ADMM's practical efficacy and its unifying potential.
This overview also highlights the emergence of the proximal center method and
its applications in diverse domains. Furthermore, the paper underscores the
distinctive features of ALADIN, which offers convergence guarantees for
non-convex scenarios without introducing auxiliary variables, differentiating
it from traditional augmentation techniques. In essence, this work encapsulates
the historical trajectory of distributed optimization and underscores the
promising prospects of ALADIN in addressing non-convex optimization challenges.

<p class="mathjax">Large skew-t factor copula models are attractive for the modeling of
financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence.
We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and
Capitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence
than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high
dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian
variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a conditionally
Gaussian generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an
augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A fast stochastic
gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The
new methodology is used to estimate copula models for intraday returns from
2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity
in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in
pairwise correlations. We show that intraday predictive densities from the
skew-t copula are more accurate than from some other copula models, while
portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise tail
dependencies improve performance relative to the benchmark index.

<p class="mathjax">As data shift or new data become available, updating clinical machine
learning models may be necessary to maintain or improve performance over time.
However, updating a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior
of the updated model does not align with user expectations, resulting in poor
user-model team performance. Existing compatibility measures depend on model
decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are
used to generate rankings based on estimated risk. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging
good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection
techniques, with an increase in $C^R$ of $0.019$ ($95\%$ confidence interval:
$0.005$, $0.035$). This work provides new tools to analyze and update risk
stratification models used in clinical care.

<p class="mathjax">Structural MRI and PET imaging play an important role in the diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease (AD), showing the morphological changes and glucose
metabolism changes in the brain respectively. The manifestations in the brain
image of some cognitive impairment patients are relatively inconspicuous, for
example, it still has difficulties in achieving accurate diagnosis through sMRI
in clinical practice. With the emergence of deep learning, convolutional neural
network (CNN) has become a valuable method in AD-aided diagnosis, but some CNN
methods cannot effectively learn the features of brain image, making the
diagnosis of AD still presents some challenges. In this work, we propose an
end-to-end 3D CNN framework for AD diagnosis based on ResNet, which integrates
multi-layer features obtained under the effect of the attention mechanism to
better capture subtle differences in brain images. The attention maps showed
our model can focus on key brain regions related to the disease diagnosis. Our
method was verified in ablation experiments with two modality images on 792
subjects from the ADNI database, where AD diagnostic accuracies of 89.71% and
91.18% were achieved based on sMRI and PET respectively, and also outperformed
some state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in
engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these
primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact.
Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource
requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this
approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative
physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide
a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
<br />At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated
fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling
from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic
oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear
systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix
determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions,
we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to
digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms
exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration,
highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields,
and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal irreversibility, often referred to as the arrow of time, is a
fundamental concept in statistical mechanics. Markers of irreversibility also
provide a powerful characterisation of information processing in biological
systems. However, current approaches tend to describe temporal irreversibility
in terms of a single scalar quantity, without disentangling the underlying
dynamics that contribute to irreversibility. Here we propose a broadly
applicable information-theoretic framework to characterise the arrow of time in
multivariate time series, which yields qualitatively different types of
irreversible information dynamics. This multidimensional characterisation
reveals previously unreported high-order modes of irreversibility, and
establishes a formal connection between recent heuristic markers of temporal
irreversibility and metrics of information processing. We demonstrate the
prevalence of high-order irreversibility in the hyperactive regime of a
biophysical model of brain dynamics, showing that our framework is both
theoretically principled and empirically useful. This work challenges the view
of the arrow of time as a monolithic entity, enhancing both our theoretical
understanding of irreversibility and our ability to detect it in practical
applications.

<p class="mathjax">We show that the essential properties of entropy (monotonicity, additivity
and subadditivity) are consequences of entropy being a monoidal natural
transformation from the under category functor $-/\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ (where
$\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ is category of $\ell_{\rho}$ discrete probability
spaces) to $\Delta_{\mathbb{R}}$. Moreover, the Shannon entropy can be
characterized as the universal monoidal natural transformation from
$-/\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ to the category of "strongly regularly ordered"
vector spaces (a reflective subcategory of the lax-slice 2-category over
$\mathsf{MonCat}_{\ell}$ in the 2-category of monoidal categories), providing a
succinct characterization of Shannon entropy as a reflection arrow. We can
likewise define entropy for every category with a monoidal structure on its
under categories (e.g. the category of finite abelian groups, the category of
finite inhabited sets, the category of finite dimensional vector spaces, and
the augmented simplex category) via the reflection arrow to the reflective
subcategory of strongly regularly ordered vector spaces. This implies that all
these entropies over different categories are components of a single natural
transformation (the unit of the idempotent monad), allowing us to connect these
entropies in a natural manner. We also provide a universal characterization of
the conditional Shannon entropy based on the chain rule which, unlike the
characterization of information loss by Baez, Fritz and Leinster, does not
require any continuity assumption.
