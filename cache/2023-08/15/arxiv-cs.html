<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel exploration of the interaction between generative
AI models, visualization, and narrative generation processes, using OpenAI's
GPT as a case study. Drawing on Umberto Eco's ``Six Walks in the Fictional
Woods'', we engender a speculative, transdisciplinary scientific narrative
plentiful with references and links to relevant talks. To enrich our
exposition, we present a visualization prototype to analyze storyboarded
narratives, and extensive conversations with ChatGPT. Our paper is thoroughly
decorated with thoughtful decorations that try to encode meaning and complement
the narrative.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm,
aiming to train a global model by exploiting the decentralized data across
millions of edge devices. Compared with centralized learning, FL preserves the
clients' privacy by refraining from explicitly downloading their data. However,
given the geo-distributed edge devices (e.g., mobile, car, train, or subway)
with highly dynamic networks in the wild, aggregating all the model updates
from those participating devices will result in inevitable long-tail delays in
FL. This will significantly degrade the efficiency of the training process. To
resolve the high system heterogeneity in time-sensitive FL scenarios, we
propose a novel FL framework, DynamicFL, by considering the communication
dynamics and data quality across massive edge devices with a specially designed
client manipulation strategy. \ours actively selects clients for model updating
based on the network prediction from its dynamic network conditions and the
quality of its training data. Additionally, our long-term greedy strategy in
client selection tackles the problem of system performance degradation caused
by short-term scheduling in a dynamic network. Lastly, to balance the trade-off
between client performance evaluation and client manipulation granularity, we
dynamically adjust the length of the observation window in the training process
to optimize the long-term system efficiency. Compared with the state-of-the-art
client selection scheme in FL, \ours can achieve a better model accuracy while
consuming only 18.9\% -- 84.0\% of the wall-clock time. Our component-wise and
sensitivity studies further demonstrate the robustness of \ours under various
real-life scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">After the pandemic, humanity has been facing different types of challenges.
Social relationships, societal values, and academic and professional behavior
have been hit the most. People are shifting their routines to social media and
gadgets, and getting addicted to their isolation. This sudden change in their
lives has caused an unusual social breakdown and endangered their mental
health. In mid-2021, Pakistan's first Human Library was established under
HelpingMind to overcome these effects. Despite online sessions and webinars,
HelpingMind needs technology to reach the masses. In this work, we customized
the UI or UX of a Go Together Mobile Application (GTMA) to meet the
requirements of the client organization. A very interesting concept of the book
(expert listener or psychologist) and the reader is introduced in GTMA. It
offers separate dashboards, separate reviews or rating systems, booking, and
venue information to engage the human reader with his or her favorite human
book. The loyalty program enables the members to avail discounts through a
mobile application and its membership is global where both the human-reader and
human-books can register under the platform. The minimum viable product has
been approved by our client organization.

<p class="mathjax">The assessment of behavioral traits in dogs is a well-studied challenge due
to its many practical applications such as selection for breeding, prediction
of working aptitude, chances of being adopted, etc. Most methods for assessing
behavioral traits are questionnaire or observation-based, which require a
significant amount of time, effort and expertise. In addition, these methods
are also susceptible to subjectivity and bias, making them less reliable. In
this study, we proposed an automated computational approach that may provide a
more objective, robust and resource-efficient alternative to current solutions.
Using part of a Stranger Test protocol, we tested n=53 dogs for their response
to the presence and benign actions of a stranger. Dog coping styles were scored
by three experts. Moreover, data were collected from their handlers using the
Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). An
unsupervised clustering of the dogs' trajectories revealed two main clusters
showing a significant difference in the stranger-directed fear C-BARQ factor,
as well as a good separation between (sufficiently) relaxed dogs and dogs with
excessive behaviors towards strangers based on expert scoring. Based on the
clustering, we obtained a machine learning classifier for expert scoring of
coping styles towards strangers, which reached an accuracy of 78%. We also
obtained a regression model predicting C-BARQ factor scores with varying
performance, the best being Owner-Directed Aggression (with a mean average
error of 0.108) and Excitability (with a mean square error of 0.032). This case
study demonstrates a novel paradigm of digitally enhanced canine behavioral
testing.

<p class="mathjax">Parkinson's is a Neurologic disorder that not only affects the human body but
also their social and personal life. Especially children having the Parkinson's
disease come up with infinite difficulties in different areas of life mostly in
social interaction, communication, connectedness, and other skills such as
thinking, reasoning, learning, remembering. This study gives the solution to
learning social skills by using smartphone applications. The children having
Parkinson's disease (juvenile) can learn to solve social and common problems by
observing real-life situations that cannot be explained properly by
instructors. The result shows that the application will enhance their
involvement in learning and solving a complex problem.

<p class="mathjax">Rotational invariance is a popular inductive bias used by many fields in
machine learning, such as computer vision and machine learning for quantum
chemistry. Rotation-invariant machine learning methods set the state of the art
for many tasks, including molecular property prediction and 3D shape
classification. These methods generally either rely on task-specific
rotation-invariant features, or they use general-purpose deep neural networks
which are complicated to design and train. However, it is unclear whether the
success of these methods is primarily due to the rotation invariance or the
deep neural networks. To address this question, we suggest a simple and
general-purpose method for learning rotation-invariant functions of
three-dimensional point cloud data using a random features approach.
Specifically, we extend the random features method of Rahimi &amp; Recht 2007 by
deriving a version that is invariant to three-dimensional rotations and showing
that it is fast to evaluate on point cloud data. We show through experiments
that our method matches or outperforms the performance of general-purpose
rotation-invariant neural networks on standard molecular property prediction
benchmark datasets QM7 and QM9. We also show that our method is general-purpose
and provides a rotation-invariant baseline on the ModelNet40 shape
classification task. Finally, we show that our method has an order of magnitude
smaller prediction latency than competing kernel methods.

<p class="mathjax">Imagine stepping into a virtual world that's as rich, dynamic, and
interactive as our physical one. This is the promise of the Metaverse, and it's
being brought to life by the transformative power of Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI). This paper offers a comprehensive exploration of how
generative AI technologies are shaping the Metaverse, transforming it into a
dynamic, immersive, and interactive virtual world. We delve into the
applications of text generation models like ChatGPT and GPT-3, which are
enhancing conversational interfaces with AI-generated characters. We explore
the role of image generation models such as DALL-E and MidJourney in creating
visually stunning and diverse content. We also examine the potential of 3D
model generation technologies like Point-E and Lumirithmic in creating
realistic virtual objects that enrich the Metaverse experience. But the journey
doesn't stop there. We also address the challenges and ethical considerations
of implementing these technologies in the Metaverse, offering insights into the
balance between user control and AI automation. This paper is not just a study,
but a guide to the future of the Metaverse, offering readers a roadmap to
harnessing the power of generative AI in creating immersive virtual worlds.

<p class="mathjax">Improving the effectiveness of problem solving in teams is an important
research topic due to the complexity and cross-disciplinary nature of modern
problems. It is unlikely that an individual can successfully tackle alone such
problems. Increasing team effectiveness is challenging due to the many
entangled cognitive, motivational, social, and emotional aspects specific to
teamwork. It is often difficult to reliably identify the characteristics that
make a team efficient or those that are main hurdles in teamwork. Moreover,
experiments often produced conflicting results, which suggests possibly
incorrect modeling of team activities and/or hypothesis formulation errors.
Automated data acquisition followed by analytics based on models for teamwork
is a intriguing option to alleviate some of the limitations. This paper
proposes a model describing an individual's activities during team problem
solving. Verbal discussions between team members are used to build models. The
model captures the multiple images (representations) created and used by an
individual during solving as well as the solving activities utilizing these
images. Then, a team model includes the interacting models of the members. Case
studies showed that the model can highlight differences between teams depending
on the nature of the individual work before teamwork starts. Inefficiencies in
teamwork can be also pointed out using the model.

<p class="mathjax">While research on explainable AI (XAI) is booming and explanation techniques
have proven promising in many application domains, standardised human-centred
evaluation procedures are still missing. In addition, current evaluation
procedures do not assess XAI methods holistically in the sense that they do not
treat explanations' effects on humans as a complex user experience. To tackle
this challenge, we propose to adapt the User-Centric Evaluation Framework used
in recommender systems: we integrate explanation aspects, summarise explanation
properties, indicate relations between them, and categorise metrics that
measure these properties. With this comprehensive evaluation framework, we hope
to contribute to the human-centred standardisation of XAI evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Farmers can now use IoT to improve farm efficiency and productivity by using
sensors for farm monitoring to enhance decision-making in areas such as
fertilization, irrigation, climate forecast, and harvesting information. Local
farmers in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on the other hand, continue to lack knowledge
and experience with smart farm technology. As a result, the 'SUNSpACe' project,
funded by the European Union's Erasmus+ Program, was launched to launch a
training course which improve the knowledge and performance of Thai farmers. To
assess the effectiveness of the training, The Kirkpatrick model was used in
this study. Eight local farmers took part in the training, which was divided
into two sections: mobile learning and smart farm laboratory. During the
training activities, different levels of the Kirkpatrick model were conducted
and tested: reaction (satisfaction test), learning (knowledge test), and
behavior (performance test). The overall result demonstrated the participants'
positive reaction to the outcome. The paper also discusses the limitations and
suggestions for training activities.

<p class="mathjax">This article showcases a personal decision support tool (PDST) called
HOPLITE, for performing insightful and actionable quantitative assessments of
hospital capacity, to support hospital planners and health care managers. The
tool is user-friendly and intuitive, automates tasks, provides instant
reporting, and is extensible. It has been developed as an Excel Visual Basic
for Applications (VBA) due to its perceived ease of deployment, ease of use,
Office's vast installed userbase, and extensive legacy in business. The
methodology developed in this article bridges the gap between mathematical
theory and practice, which our inference suggests, has restricted the uptake
and or development of advanced hospital planning tools and software. To the
best of our knowledge, no personal decision support tool (PDST) has yet been
created and installed within any existing hospital IT systems, to perform the
aforementioned tasks. This article demonstrates that the development of a PDST
for hospitals is viable and that optimization methods can be embedded quite
simply at no cost. The results of extensive development and testing indicate
that HOPLITE can automate many nuanced tasks. Furthermore, there are few
limitations and only minor scalability issues with the application of free to
use optimization software. The functionality that HOPLITE provides may make it
easier to calibrate hospitals strategically and/or tactically to demands. It
may give hospitals more control over their case-mix and their resources,
helping them to operate more proactively and more efficiently.

unrestricted topologies and piecewise polynomial activation functions. We
consider the general scenario where the running time is unlimited and
floating-point numbers are used for simulating reals. We characterize a class
of these neural networks with a rule-based logic for Boolean networks. In
particular, we show that the sizes of the neural networks and the corresponding
Boolean rule formulae are polynomially related. In fact, in the direction from
Boolean rules to neural networks, the blow-up is only linear. We also analyze
the delays in running times due to the translations. In the translation from
neural networks to Boolean rules, the time delay is polylogarithmic in the
neural network size and linear in time. In the converse translation, the time
delay is linear in both factors.

<p class="mathjax">Impairment of hand functions in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI)
severely disrupts activities of daily living. Recent advances have enabled
rehabilitation assisted by robotic devices to augment the residual function of
the muscles. Traditionally, non-invasive electromyography-based peripheral
neural interfaces have been utilized to sense volitional motor intent to drive
robotic assistive devices. However, the dexterity and fidelity of control that
can be achieved with electromyography-based control have been limited due to
inherent limitations in signal quality. We have developed and tested a
muscle-computer interface (MCI) utilizing sonomyography to provide control of a
virtual cursor for individuals with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury. We
demonstrate that individuals with SCI successfully gained control of a virtual
cursor by utilizing contractions of muscles of the wrist joint. The
sonomyography-based interface enabled control of the cursor at multiple graded
levels demonstrating the ability to achieve accurate and stable endpoint
control. Our sonomyography-based muscle-computer interface can enable dexterous
control of upper-extremity assistive devices for individuals with
motor-incomplete SCI.

<p class="mathjax">Diagnostic errors in radiology often occur due to incomplete visual
assessments by radiologists, despite their knowledge of predicting disease
classes. This insufficiency is possibly linked to the absence of required
training in search patterns. Additionally, radiologists lack consistent
feedback on their visual search patterns, relying on ad-hoc strategies and peer
input to minimize errors and enhance efficiency, leading to suboptimal patterns
and potential false negatives. This study aimed to use eye-tracking technology
to analyze radiologist search patterns, quantify performance using established
metrics, and assess the impact of an automated feedback-driven educational
framework on detection accuracy. Ten residents participated in a controlled
trial focused on detecting suspicious pulmonary nodules. They were divided into
an intervention group (received automated feedback) and a control group.
Results showed that the intervention group exhibited a 38.89% absolute
improvement in detecting suspicious-for-cancer nodules, surpassing the control
group's improvement (5.56%, p-value=0.006). Improvement was more rapid over the
four training sessions (p-value=0.0001). However, other metrics such as speed,
search pattern heterogeneity, distractions, and coverage did not show
significant changes. In conclusion, implementing an automated feedback-driven
educational framework improved radiologist accuracy in detecting suspicious
nodules. The study underscores the potential of such systems in enhancing
diagnostic performance and reducing errors. Further research and broader
implementation are needed to consolidate these promising results and develop
effective training strategies for radiologists, ultimately benefiting patient
outcomes.

independent living of elderly people. These individuals must be able to perform
their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) without help from caretakers. They must
be confident enough that help is just a few minutes with the systems in place.
The focus will be on the medical and emergency systems, which are most
essential for independent living. Zigbee based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
are used to collect the data throughout the home. Smart shirts and smart phones
monitor different parameters of the individual and transmit the data to the
home network. A PC running LabVIEW is used as the central control unit for the
entire house. The house must have a fail proof communication framework for
connecting with emergency services, doctors, helpers and relatives. The home
network is connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and
internet. SMS, email, prerecorded voice-based telephone calls are appropriately
used to report emergencies. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) was built in
LabVIEW in order to control and simulate an entire home. Ambient Intelligence
is built into the system to make it adaptive and dynamic as far as possible.

<p class="mathjax">Hairpin vortices are one of the most important vortical structures in
turbulent flows. Extracting and characterizing hairpin vortices provides useful
insight into many behaviors in turbulent flows. However, hairpin vortices have
complex configurations and might be entangled with other vortices, making their
extraction difficult. In this work, we introduce a framework to extract and
separate hairpin vortices in shear driven turbulent flows for their study. Our
method first extracts general vortical regions with a region-growing strategy
based on certain vortex criteria (e.g., $\lambda_2$) and then separates those
vortices with the help of progressive extraction of ($\lambda_2$) iso-surfaces
in a top-down fashion. This leads to a hierarchical tree representing the
spatial proximity and merging relation of vortices. After separating individual
vortices, their shape and orientation information is extracted. Candidate
hairpin vortices are identified based on their shape and orientation
information as well as their physical characteristics. An interactive
visualization system is developed to aid the exploration, classification, and
analysis of hairpin vortices based on their geometric and physical attributes.
We also present additional use cases of the proposed system for the analysis
and study of general vortices in other types of flows.

<p class="mathjax">Over the last decade, street-view type images have been used across
disciplines to generate and understand various place-based metrics. However
efforts to collect this data were often meant to support investigator-driven
research without regard to the utility of the data for other researchers. To
address this, we describe our methods for collecting and publishing
longitudinal data of this type in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss
some of the challenges we encountered along the way. Our process included
designing a route taking into account both broad area canvassing and community
capitals transects. We also implemented procedures for uploading and publishing
data from each survey. Our methods successfully generated the kind of
longitudinal data that can be beneficial to a variety of research disciplines.
However, there were some challenges with data collection consistency and the
sheer magnitude of data produced. Overall, our approach demonstrates the
feasibility of generating longitudinal street-view data in the wake of a
disaster event. Based on our experience, we provide recommendations for future
researchers attempting to create a similar data set.

<p class="mathjax">Carotid artery plaques can cause arterial vascular diseases such as stroke
and myocardial infarction, posing a severe threat to human life. However, the
current clinical examination mainly relies on a direct assessment by physicians
of patients' clinical indicators and medical images, lacking an integrated
visualization tool for analyzing the influencing factors and composition of
carotid artery plaques. We have designed an intelligent carotid artery plaque
visual analysis system for vascular surgery experts to comprehensively analyze
the clinical physiological and imaging indicators of carotid artery diseases.
The system mainly includes two functions: First, it displays the correlation
between carotid artery plaque and various factors through a series of
information visualization methods and integrates the analysis of patient
physiological indicator data. Second, it enhances the interface guidance
analysis of the inherent correlation between the components of carotid artery
plaque through machine learning and displays the spatial distribution of the
plaque on medical images. Additionally, we conducted two case studies on
carotid artery plaques using real data obtained from a hospital, and the
results indicate that our designed carotid analysis system can effectively
provide clinical diagnosis and treatment guidance for vascular surgeons.

<p class="mathjax">Visualization for machine learning (VIS4ML) research aims to help experts
apply their prior knowledge to develop, understand, and improve the performance
of machine learning models. In conceiving VIS4ML systems, researchers
characterize the nature of human knowledge to support human-in-the-loop tasks,
design interactive visualizations to make ML components interpretable and
elicit knowledge, and evaluate the effectiveness of human-model interchange. We
survey recent VIS4ML papers to assess the generalizability of research
contributions and claims in enabling human-in-the-loop ML. Our results show
potential gaps between the current scope of VIS4ML research and aspirations for
its use in practice. We find that while papers motivate that VIS4ML systems are
applicable beyond the specific conditions studied, conclusions are often
overfitted to non-representative scenarios, are based on interactions with a
small set of ML experts and well-understood datasets, fail to acknowledge
crucial dependencies, and hinge on decisions that lack justification. We
discuss approaches to close the gap between aspirations and research claims and
suggest documentation practices to report generality constraints that better
acknowledge the exploratory nature of VIS4ML research.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a method for addressing the issue of unnoticed
catastrophic deployment and domain shift in neural networks for semantic
segmentation in autonomous driving. Our approach is based on the idea that deep
learning-based perception for autonomous driving is uncertain and best
represented as a probability distribution. As autonomous vehicles' safety is
paramount, it is crucial for perception systems to recognize when the vehicle
is leaving its operational design domain, anticipate hazardous uncertainty, and
reduce the performance of the perception system. To address this, we propose to
encapsulate the neural network under deployment within an uncertainty
estimation envelope that is based on the epistemic uncertainty estimation
through the Monte Carlo Dropout approach. This approach does not require
modification of the deployed neural network and guarantees expected model
performance. Our defensive perception envelope has the capability to estimate a
neural network's performance, enabling monitoring and notification of entering
domains of reduced neural network performance under deployment. Furthermore,
our envelope is extended by novel methods to improve the application in
deployment settings, including reducing compute expenses and confining
estimation noise. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method for
multiple different potential deployment shifts relevant to autonomous driving,
such as transitions into the night, rainy, or snowy domain. Overall, our
approach shows great potential for application in deployment settings and
enables operational design domain recognition via uncertainty, which allows for
defensive perception, safe state triggers, warning notifications, and feedback
for testing or development and adaptation of the perception stack.

<p class="mathjax">Designing a novel Local Binary Pattern (LBP) process usually relies heavily
on human experts' knowledge and experience in the area. Even experts are often
left with tedious episodes of trial and error until they identify an optimal
LBP for a particular dataset. To address this problem, we present a novel
symbolic regression able to automatically discover LBP formulas to remove the
moving parts of a scene by segmenting it into a background and a foreground.
Experimental results conducted on real videos of outdoor urban scenes under
various conditions show that the LBPs discovered by the proposed approach
significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art LBP descriptors both
qualitatively and quantitatively. Our source code and data will be available
online.

<p class="mathjax">For various automated palletizing tasks, the detection of packaging units is
a crucial step preceding the actual handling of the packaging units by an
industrial robot. We propose an approach to this challenging problem that is
fully trained on synthetically generated data and can be robustly applied to
arbitrary real world packaging units without further training or setup effort.
The proposed approach is able to handle sparse and low quality sensor data, can
exploit prior knowledge if available and generalizes well to a wide range of
products and application scenarios. To demonstrate the practical use of our
approach, we conduct an extensive evaluation on real-world data with a wide
range of different retail products. Further, we integrated our approach in a
lab demonstrator and a commercial solution will be marketed through an
industrial partner.

<p class="mathjax">Resilience engineering studies the ability of a system to survive and recover
from disruptive events, which finds applications in several domains. Most
studies emphasize resilience metrics to quantify system performance, whereas
recent studies propose statistical modeling approaches to project system
recovery time after degradation. Moreover, past studies are either performed on
data after recovering or limited to idealized trends. Therefore, this paper
proposes three alternative neural network (NN) approaches including (i)
Artificial Neural Networks, (ii) Recurrent Neural Networks, and (iii)
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to model and predict system performance,
including negative and positive factors driving resilience to quantify the
impact of disruptive events and restorative activities. Goodness-of-fit
measures are computed to evaluate the models and compared with a classical
statistical model, including mean squared error and adjusted R squared. Our
results indicate that NN models outperformed the traditional model on all
goodness-of-fit measures. More specifically, LSTMs achieved an over 60\% higher
adjusted R squared, and decreased predictive error by 34-fold compared to the
traditional method. These results suggest that NN models to predict resilience
are both feasible and accurate and may find practical use in many important
domains.

<p class="mathjax">Image-based re-identification of animal individuals allows gathering of
information such as migration patterns of the animals over time. This, together
with large image volumes collected using camera traps and crowdsourcing, opens
novel possibilities to study animal populations. For many species, the
re-identification can be done by analyzing the permanent fur, feather, or skin
patterns that are unique to each individual. In this paper, we address the
re-identification by combining two types of pattern similarity metrics: 1)
pattern appearance similarity obtained by pattern feature aggregation and 2)
geometric pattern similarity obtained by analyzing the geometric consistency of
pattern similarities. The proposed combination allows to efficiently utilize
both the local and global pattern features, providing a general
re-identification approach that can be applied to a wide variety of different
pattern types. In the experimental part of the work, we demonstrate that the
method achieves promising re-identification accuracies for Saimaa ringed seals
and whale sharks.

<p class="mathjax">A critical task for developing safe autonomous driving stacks is to determine
whether an obstacle is safety-critical, i.e., poses an imminent threat to the
autonomous vehicle. Our previous work showed that Hamilton Jacobi reachability
theory can be applied to compute interaction-dynamics-aware perception safety
zones that better inform an ego vehicle's perception module which obstacles are
considered safety-critical. For completeness, these zones are typically larger
than absolutely necessary, forcing the perception module to pay attention to a
larger collection of objects for the sake of conservatism. As an improvement,
we propose a maneuver-based decomposition of our safety zones that leverages
information about the ego maneuver to reduce the zone volume. In particular, we
propose a "temporal convolution" operation that produces safety zones for
specific ego maneuvers, thus limiting the ego's behavior to reduce the size of
the safety zones. We show with numerical experiments that maneuver-based zones
are significantly smaller (up to 76% size reduction) than the baseline while
maintaining completeness.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Operator Networks are an increasingly popular paradigm for solving
regression in infinite dimensions and hence solve families of PDEs in one shot.
In this work, we aim to establish a first-of-its-kind data-dependent lowerbound
on the size of DeepONets required for them to be able to reduce empirical error
on noisy data. In particular, we show that for low training errors to be
obtained on $n$ data points it is necessary that the common output dimension of
the branch and the trunk net be scaling as $\Omega \left ( {\sqrt{n}} \right
)$. This inspires our experiments with DeepONets solving the
advection-diffusion-reaction PDE, where we demonstrate the possibility that at
a fixed model size, to leverage increase in this common output dimension and
get monotonic lowering of training error, the size of the training data might
necessarily need to scale quadratically with it.

<p class="mathjax">Deep-learning-based surrogate models show great promise for use in geological
carbon storage operations. In this work we target an important application -
the history matching of storage systems characterized by a high degree of
(prior) geological uncertainty. Toward this goal, we extend the recently
introduced recurrent R-U-Net surrogate model to treat geomodel realizations
drawn from a wide range of geological scenarios. These scenarios are defined by
a set of metaparameters, which include the mean and standard deviation of
log-permeability, permeability anisotropy ratio, horizontal correlation length,
etc. An infinite number of realizations can be generated for each set of
metaparameters, so the range of prior uncertainty is large. The surrogate model
is trained with flow simulation results, generated using the open-source
simulator GEOS, for 2000 random realizations. The flow problems involve four
wells, each injecting 1 Mt CO2/year, for 30 years. The trained surrogate model
is shown to provide accurate predictions for new realizations over the full
range of geological scenarios, with median relative error of 1.3% in pressure
and 4.5% in saturation. The surrogate model is incorporated into a Markov chain
Monte Carlo history matching workflow, where the goal is to generate history
matched realizations and posterior estimates of the metaparameters. We show
that, using observed data from monitoring wells in synthetic `true' models,
geological uncertainty is reduced substantially. This leads to posterior 3D
pressure and saturation fields that display much closer agreement with the
true-model responses than do prior predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have successfully been applied to generative tasks in
various continuous domains. However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical
data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains
often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical
framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror
Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical
report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the
context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains
such as image and text generation.

<p class="mathjax">Contrary to the stunning feats observed in birds of prey, aerial manipulation
and grasping with flying robots still lack versatility and agility.
Conventional approaches using rigid manipulators require precise positioning
and are subject to large reaction forces at grasp, which limit performance at
high speeds. The few reported examples of aggressive aerial grasping rely on
motion capture systems, or fail to generalize across environments and grasp
targets. We describe the first example of a soft aerial manipulator equipped
with a fully onboard perception pipeline, capable of robustly localizing and
grasping visually and morphologically varied objects. The proposed system
features a novel passively closing tendon-actuated soft gripper that enables
fast closure at grasp, while compensating for position errors, complying to the
target-object morphology, and dampening reaction forces. The system includes an
onboard perception pipeline that combines a neural-network-based semantic
keypoint detector with a state-of-the-art robust 3D object pose estimator,
whose estimate is further refined using a fixed-lag smoother. The resulting
pose estimate is passed to a minimum-snap trajectory planner, tracked by an
adaptive controller that fully compensates for the added mass of the grasped
object. Finally, a finite-element-based controller determines optimal gripper
configurations for grasping. Rigorous experiments confirm that our approach
enables dynamic, aggressive, and versatile grasping. We demonstrate fully
onboard vision-based grasps of a variety of objects, in both indoor and outdoor
environments, and up to speeds of 2.0 m/s -- the fastest vision-based grasp
reported in the literature. Finally, we take a major step in expanding the
utility of our platform beyond stationary targets, by demonstrating
motion-capture-based grasps of targets moving up to 0.3 m/s, with relative
speeds up to 1.5 m/s.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel method to learn intractable distributions from their
samples. The main idea is to use a parametric distribution model, such as a
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to approximate intractable distributions by
minimizing the KL-divergence. Based on this idea, there are two challenges that
need to be addressed. First, the computational complexity of KL-divergence is
unacceptable when the dimensions of distributions increases. The Monte-Carlo
Marginalization (MCMarg) is proposed to address this issue. The second
challenge is the differentiability of the optimization process, since the
target distribution is intractable. We handle this problem by using Kernel
Density Estimation (KDE). The proposed approach is a powerful tool to learn
complex distributions and the entire process is differentiable. Thus, it can be
a better substitute of the variational inference in variational auto-encoders
(VAE). One strong evidence of the benefit of our method is that the
distributions learned by the proposed approach can generate better images even
based on a pre-trained VAE's decoder. Based on this point, we devise a
distribution learning auto-encoder which is better than VAE under the same
network architecture. Experiments on standard dataset and synthetic data
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">Social determinants of health (SDoH) have an important impact on patient
outcomes but are incompletely collected from the electronic health records
(EHR). This study researched the ability of large language models to extract
SDoH from free text in EHRs, where they are most commonly documented, and
explored the role of synthetic clinical text for improving the extraction of
these scarcely documented, yet extremely valuable, clinical data. 800 patient
notes were annotated for SDoH categories, and several transformer-based models
were evaluated. The study also experimented with synthetic data generation and
assessed for algorithmic bias. Our best-performing models were fine-tuned
Flan-T5 XL (macro-F1 0.71) for any SDoH, and Flan-T5 XXL (macro-F1 0.70). The
benefit of augmenting fine-tuning with synthetic data varied across model
architecture and size, with smaller Flan-T5 models (base and large) showing the
greatest improvements in performance (delta F1 +0.12 to +0.23). Model
performance was similar on the in-hospital system dataset but worse on the
MIMIC-III dataset. Our best-performing fine-tuned models outperformed zero- and
few-shot performance of ChatGPT-family models for both tasks. These fine-tuned
models were less likely than ChatGPT to change their prediction when
race/ethnicity and gender descriptors were added to the text, suggesting less
algorithmic bias (p&lt;0.05). At the patient-level, our models identified 93.8% of
patients with adverse SDoH, while ICD-10 codes captured 2.0%. Our method can
effectively extracted SDoH information from clinic notes, performing better
compare to GPT zero- and few-shot settings. These models could enhance
real-world evidence on SDoH and aid in identifying patients needing social
support.

<p class="mathjax">A recommender system that optimizes its recommendations solely to fit a
user's history of ratings for consumed items can create a filter bubble,
wherein the user does not get to experience items from novel, unseen
categories. One approach to mitigate this undesired behavior is to recommend
items with high potential for serendipity, namely surprising items that are
likely to be highly rated. In this paper, we propose a content-based
formulation of serendipity that is rooted in Bayesian surprise and use it to
measure the serendipity of items after they are consumed and rated by the user.
When coupled with a collaborative-filtering component that identifies similar
users, this enables recommending items with high potential for serendipity. To
facilitate the evaluation of topic-level models for surprise and serendipity,
we introduce a dataset of book reading histories extracted from Goodreads,
containing over 26 thousand users and close to 1.3 million books, where we
manually annotate 449 books read by 4 users in terms of their time-dependent,
topic-level surprise. Experimental evaluations show that models that use
Bayesian surprise correlate much better with the manual annotations of
topic-level surprise than distance-based heuristics, and also obtain better
serendipitous item recommendation performance.

<p class="mathjax">This study introduces a novel non-coherent over-the-air computation (OAC)
scheme aimed at achieving reliable majority vote (MV) calculations in fading
channels. The proposed approach relies on modulating the amplitude of the
elements of complementary sequences (CSs) based on the sign of the parameters
to be aggregated. Notably, our method eliminates the reliance on channel state
information at the nodes, rendering it compatible with time-varying channels.
To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we employ it in a scenario where
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is guided by distributed sensors, relying on
the MV computed using our proposed scheme. The experimental results confirm the
superiority of our approach, as evidenced by a significant reduction in
computation error rates in fading channels, particularly with longer sequence
lengths. Meanwhile, we ensure that the peak-to-mean-envelope power ratio of the
transmitted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals remains within
or below 3 dB.

<p class="mathjax">The fundamental principles, potential applications, and ethical concerns of
ChatGPT are analyzed and discussed in this study. Since ChatGPT emerged, it has
gained a rapidly growing popularity, with more than 600 million users today.
The development of ChatGPT was a significant mile-stone, as it demonstrated the
potential of large-scale language models to generate natural language responses
that are almost indistinguishable from those of a human. ChatGPT's operational
principles, prospective applications, and ability to advance a range of human
endeavours are discussed in the paper. However, much of the work discusses and
poses moral and other problems that rely on the subject. To document the
latter, we submitted 14 queries and captured the ChatGPT responses. ChatGPT
appeared to be honest, self-knowledgeable, and careful with its answers. The
authors come to the realization that since AI is already a part of society, the
pervasiveness of the ChatGPT tool to the general public has once again brought
to light concerns regarding AI in general. Still, they have moved from the
domain of scientific community collective reflection at a conceptual level to
everyday practice this time.

<p class="mathjax">Automated market makers (AMMs) are pricing mechanisms utilized by
decentralized exchanges (DEX). Traditional AMM approaches are constrained by
pricing solely based on their own liquidity pool, without consideration of
external markets or risk management for liquidity providers. In this paper, we
propose a new approach known as UBET AMM (UAMM), which calculates prices by
considering external market prices and the impermanent loss of the liquidity
pool. Despite relying on external market prices, our method maintains the
desired properties of a constant product curve when computing slippages. The
key element of UAMM is determining the appropriate slippage amount based on the
desired target balance, which encourages the liquidity pool to minimize
impermanent loss. We demonstrate that our approach eliminates arbitrage
opportunities when external market prices are efficient.

<p class="mathjax">A key challenge in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence is the well-known
tradeoff between the transparency of an algorithm (i.e., how easily a human can
directly understand the algorithm, as opposed to receiving a post-hoc
explanation), and its accuracy. We report on the design of a new deep network
that achieves improved transparency without sacrificing accuracy. We design a
deep convolutional neuro-fuzzy inference system (DCNFIS) by hybridizing fuzzy
logic and deep learning models and show that DCNFIS performs as accurately as
three existing convolutional neural networks on four well-known datasets. We
furthermore that DCNFIS outperforms state-of-the-art deep fuzzy systems. We
then exploit the transparency of fuzzy logic by deriving explanations, in the
form of saliency maps, from the fuzzy rules encoded in DCNFIS. We investigate
the properties of these explanations in greater depth using the Fashion-MNIST

<p class="mathjax">Voice conversion (VC) aims at altering a person's voice to make it sound
similar to the voice of another person while preserving linguistic content.
Existing methods suffer from a dilemma between content intelligibility and
speaker similarity; i.e., methods with higher intelligibility usually have a
lower speaker similarity, while methods with higher speaker similarity usually
require plenty of target speaker voice data to achieve high intelligibility. In
this work, we propose a novel method \textit{Phoneme Hallucinator} that
achieves the best of both worlds. Phoneme Hallucinator is a one-shot VC model;
it adopts a novel model to hallucinate diversified and high-fidelity target
speaker phonemes based just on a short target speaker voice (e.g. 3 seconds).
The hallucinated phonemes are then exploited to perform neighbor-based voice
conversion. Our model is a text-free, any-to-any VC model that requires no text
annotations and supports conversion to any unseen speaker. Objective and
subjective evaluations show that \textit{Phoneme Hallucinator} outperforms
existing VC methods for both intelligibility and speaker similarity.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose U-RED, an Unsupervised shape REtrieval and
Deformation pipeline that takes an arbitrary object observation as input,
typically captured by RGB images or scans, and jointly retrieves and deforms
the geometrically similar CAD models from a pre-established database to tightly
match the target. Considering existing methods typically fail to handle noisy
partial observations, U-RED is designed to address this issue from two aspects.
First, since one partial shape may correspond to multiple potential full
shapes, the retrieval method must allow such an ambiguous one-to-many
relationship. Thereby U-RED learns to project all possible full shapes of a
partial target onto the surface of a unit sphere. Then during inference, each
sampling on the sphere will yield a feasible retrieval. Second, since
real-world partial observations usually contain noticeable noise, a reliable
learned metric that measures the similarity between shapes is necessary for
stable retrieval. In U-RED, we design a novel point-wise residual-guided metric
that allows noise-robust comparison. Extensive experiments on the synthetic
datasets PartNet, ComplementMe and the real-world dataset Scan2CAD demonstrate
that U-RED surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches by 47.3%, 16.7% and
31.6% respectively under Chamfer Distance.

LLM towards a desired behavior, aligning the generated text with the
preferences of the human operator. We propose using another language model as a
critic, reward model in a zero-shot way thanks to the prompt of a Yes-No
question that represents the user preferences, without requiring further
labeled data. This zero-shot reward model provides the learning signal to
further fine-tune the base LLM using reinforcement learning, as in RLAIF; yet
our approach is also compatible in other contexts such as quality-diversity
search. Extensive evidence of the capabilities of the proposed ZYN framework is
provided through experiments in different domains related to text generation,
including detoxification; optimizing sentiment of movie reviews, or any other
attribute; steering the opinion about a particular topic the model may have;
and personalizing prompt generators for text-to-image tasks. Code to be

<p class="mathjax">While Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve many NLP tasks in zero-shot
settings, applications involving embodied agents remain problematic. In
particular, complex plans that require multi-step reasoning become difficult
and too costly as the context window grows. Planning requires understanding the
likely effects of one's actions and identifying whether the current environment
satisfies the goal state. While symbolic planners find optimal solutions
quickly, they require a complete and accurate representation of the planning
problem, severely limiting their use in practical scenarios. In contrast,
modern LLMs cope with noisy observations and high levels of uncertainty when
reasoning about a task. Our work presents LLM Dynamic Planner (LLM-DP): a
neuro-symbolic framework where an LLM works hand-in-hand with a traditional
planner to solve an embodied task. Given action-descriptions, LLM-DP solves
Alfworld faster and more efficiently than a naive LLM ReAct baseline.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic understanding of roadways is a key enabling factor for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing autonomous driving datasets provide
well-structured urban roads while ignoring unstructured roadways containing
distress, potholes, water puddles, and various kinds of road patches i.e.,
earthen, gravel etc. To this end, we introduce Road Region Segmentation dataset
(R2S100K) -- a large-scale dataset and benchmark for training and evaluation of
road segmentation in aforementioned challenging unstructured roadways. R2S100K
comprises 100K images extracted from a large and diverse set of video sequences
covering more than 1000 KM of roadways. Out of these 100K privacy respecting
images, 14,000 images have fine pixel-labeling of road regions, with 86,000
unlabeled images that can be leveraged through semi-supervised learning
methods. Alongside, we present an Efficient Data Sampling (EDS) based
self-training framework to improve learning by leveraging unlabeled data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
improves learning methods in generalizability and reduces the labeling cost for
semantic segmentation tasks. Our benchmark will be publicly available to
facilitate future research at https://r2s100k.github.io/.

especially for Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, generating detailed
responses that are visually grounded is still a challenging task for these
models. We find that even the current state-of-the-art LVLMs (InstructBLIP)
still contain a staggering 30 percent of hallucinatory text in the form of
non-existent objects, unfaithful descriptions, and inaccurate relationships. To
address this, we introduce M-HalDetect, a {M}ultimodal {Hal}lucination
{Detect}ion Dataset that can be used to train and benchmark models for
hallucination detection and prevention. M-HalDetect consists of 16k
fine-grained labels on VQA examples, making it the first comprehensive
multi-modal hallucination detection dataset for detailed image descriptions.
Unlike previous work that only consider object hallucination, we additionally
annotate both entity descriptions and relationships that are unfaithful. To
demonstrate the potential of this dataset for preference alignment, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization, as well as train fine-grained
multi-modal reward models and evaluate their effectiveness with best-of-n
rejection sampling. We perform human evaluation on both DPO and rejection
sampling, and find that they reduce hallucination rates by 41% and 55%
respectively, a significant improvement over the baseline.

<p class="mathjax">Power quality monitoring has become a vital need in modern power systems
owing to the need for agile operation and troubleshooting scheme. On the other
hand, the nature of load in modern power system is changing in many ways.
Digital loads, which are mostly relied on power electronic equipment, may
distort the quality of power flowing through the network. Moreover, one of the
most critical objectives of smart grids is to improve quality of services
delivered to customers, alongside with security, reliability and efficiency. To
this end, a novel method based on compressive sensing is proposed in this paper
to detect the source and the magnitude of the harmonics. The method takes
advantages of compressive sensing theory in such a way that a real-time
monitoring of harmonic distortion is obtained with a limited number of
measurements. The efficacy of the method is checked by means of various
simulations on IEEE 118 bus test system. The results show the capabilities of
the method in both noisy and noise-free conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) initially gained attention for developing
applications that aid physically impaired individuals. Recently, the idea of
integrating BCI with Augmented Reality (AR) emerged, which uses BCI not only to
enhance the quality of life for individuals with disabilities but also to
develop mainstream applications for healthy users. One commonly used BCI signal
pattern is the Steady-state Visually-evoked Potential (SSVEP), which captures
the brain's response to flickering visual stimuli. SSVEP-based BCI-AR
applications enable users to express their needs/wants by simply looking at
corresponding command options. However, individuals are different in brain
signals and thus require per-subject SSVEP recognition. Moreover, muscle
movements and eye blinks interfere with brain signals, and thus subjects are
required to remain still during BCI experiments, which limits AR engagement. In
this paper, we (1) propose a simple adaptive ensemble classification system
that handles the inter-subject variability, (2) present a simple BCI-AR
framework that supports the development of a wide range of SSVEP-based BCI-AR
applications, and (3) evaluate the performance of our ensemble algorithm in an
SSVEP-based BCI-AR application with head rotations which has demonstrated
robustness to the movement interference. Our testing on multiple subjects
achieved a mean accuracy of 80\% on a PC and 77\% using the HoloLens AR
headset, both of which surpass previous studies that incorporate individual
classifiers and head movements. In addition, our visual stimulation time is 5
seconds which is relatively short. The statistically significant results show
that our ensemble classification approach outperforms individual classifiers in
SSVEP-based BCIs.

<p class="mathjax">By definition, people are reticent or even unwilling to talk about taboo
subjects. Because subjects like sexuality, health, and violence are taboo in
most cultures, important information on each of these subjects can be difficult
to obtain. Are peer produced knowledge bases like Wikipedia a promising
approach for providing people with information on taboo subjects? With its
reliance on volunteers who might also be averse to taboo, can the peer
production model produce high-quality information on taboo subjects? In this
paper, we seek to understand the role of taboo in knowledge bases produced by
volunteers. We do so by developing a novel computational approach to identify
taboo subjects and by using this method to identify a set of articles on taboo
subjects in English Wikipedia. We find that articles on taboo subjects are more
popular than non-taboo articles and that they are frequently vandalized.
Despite frequent vandalism attacks, we also find that taboo articles are higher
quality than non-taboo articles. We hypothesize that stigmatizing societal
attitudes will lead contributors to taboo subjects to seek to be less
identifiable. Although our results are consistent with this proposal in several
ways, we surprisingly find that contributors make themselves more identifiable
in others.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have begun to overshadow GANs and other generative models in
industrial applications due to their superior image generation performance. The
complex architecture of these models furnishes an extensive array of attack
features. In light of this, we aim to design membership inference attacks
(MIAs) catered to diffusion models. We first conduct an exhaustive analysis of
existing MIAs on diffusion models, taking into account factors such as
black-box/white-box models and the selection of attack features. We found that
white-box attacks are highly applicable in real-world scenarios, and the most
effective attacks presently are white-box. Departing from earlier research,
which employs model loss as the attack feature for white-box MIAs, we employ
model gradients in our attack, leveraging the fact that these gradients provide
a more profound understanding of model responses to various samples. We subject
these models to rigorous testing across a range of parameters, including
training steps, sampling frequency, diffusion steps, and data variance. Across
all experimental settings, our method consistently demonstrated near-flawless
attack performance, with attack success rate approaching $100\%$ and attack
AUCROC near $1.0$. We also evaluate our attack against common defense
mechanisms, and observe our attacks continue to exhibit commendable
performance.

widely, with plenty of developments occurring alongside technological advances,
not seldom driven by big industry players. With the huge reach and

is the first to study the CrUX dataset from the viewpoint of relevant metrics
by quantitative evaluation of users Web browsing experience across three device
types and nine European countries. Analysis of data segmented by connection

for all metrics. Similar analysis in the country dimension, shows North
European countries (Sweden, Finland) having maximum 4G connections (85.99%,
81.41% respectively) and steadily performing 25%-36% better at the 75th

the challenge of manually rewriting legacy or unoptimized code in

offers significant benefits, including simplified workflows for developers to
run legacy code on Gemmini generated accelerators and a streamlined programming

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies show promising performance in open-vocabulary object detection
(OVD) using pseudo labels (PLs) from pretrained vision and language models
(VLMs). However, PLs generated by VLMs are extremely noisy due to the gap
between the pretraining objective of VLMs and OVD, which blocks further
advances on PLs. In this paper, we aim to reduce the noise in PLs and propose a
method called online Self-training And a Split-and-fusion head for OVD
(SAS-Det). First, the self-training finetunes VLMs to generate high quality PLs
while prevents forgetting the knowledge learned in the pretraining. Second, a
split-and-fusion (SAF) head is designed to remove the noise in localization of
PLs, which is usually ignored in existing methods. It also fuses complementary
knowledge learned from both precise ground truth and noisy pseudo labels to
boost the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAS-Det is both
efficient and effective. Our pseudo labeling is 3 times faster than prior
methods. SAS-Det outperforms prior state-of-the-art models of the same scale by
a clear margin and achieves 37.4 AP$_{50}$ and 27.3 AP$_r$ on novel categories
of the COCO and LVIS benchmarks, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This work investigates the design of sparse secret sharing schemes that
encode a sparse private matrix into sparse shares. This investigation is
motivated by distributed computing, where the multiplication of sparse and
private matrices is moved from a computationally weak main node to untrusted
worker machines. Classical secret-sharing schemes produce dense shares.
However, sparsity can help speed up the computation. We show that, for matrices
with i.i.d. entries, sparsity in the shares comes at a fundamental cost of
weaker privacy. We derive a fundamental tradeoff between sparsity and privacy
and construct optimal sparse secret sharing schemes that produce shares that
leak the minimum amount of information for a desired sparsity of the shares. We
apply our schemes to distributed sparse and private matrix multiplication
schemes with no colluding workers while tolerating stragglers. For the setting
of two non-communicating clusters of workers, we design a sparse one-time pad
so that no private information is leaked to a cluster of untrusted and
colluding workers, and the shares with bounded but non-zero leakage are
assigned to a cluster of partially trusted workers. We conclude by discussing
the necessity of using permutations for matrices with correlated entries.

<p class="mathjax">Wave energy converters (WECs) are a promising candidate for meeting the
increasing energy demands of today's society. It is known that the sizing and
power take-off (PTO) control of WEC devices have a major impact on their
performance. In addition, to improve power generation, WECs must be optimally
deployed within a farm. While such individual aspects have been investigated
for various WECs, potential improvements may be attained by leveraging an
integrated, system-level design approach that considers all of these aspects.
However, the computational complexity of estimating the hydrodynamic
interaction effects significantly increases for large numbers of WECs. In this
article, we undertake this challenge by developing data-driven surrogate models
using artificial neural networks and the principles of many-body expansion. The
effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by solving a concurrent plant
(i.e., sizing), control (i.e., PTO parameters), and layout optimization of
heaving cylinder WEC devices. WEC dynamics were modeled in the frequency
domain, subject to probabilistic incident waves with farms of $3$, $5$, $7$,
and $10$ WECs. The results indicate promising directions toward a practical
framework for array design investigations with more tractable computational
demands.

<p class="mathjax">Planning an autonomous vehicle's (AV) path in a space shared with pedestrians
requires reasoning about pedestrians' future trajectories. A practical
pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithm for the use of AVs needs to consider
the effect of the vehicle's interactions with the pedestrians on pedestrians'
future motion behaviours. In this regard, this paper systematically reviews
different methods proposed in the literature for modelling pedestrian
trajectory prediction in presence of vehicles that can be applied for
unstructured environments. This paper also investigates specific considerations
for pedestrian-vehicle interaction (compared with pedestrian-pedestrian
interaction) and reviews how different variables such as prediction
uncertainties and behavioural differences are accounted for in the previously
proposed prediction models. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Articles that did
not consider vehicle and pedestrian interactions or actual trajectories, and
articles that only focused on road crossing were excluded. A total of 1260
unique peer-reviewed articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus
databases were identified in the search. 64 articles were included in the final
review as they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An overview of
datasets containing trajectory data of both pedestrians and vehicles used by
the reviewed papers has been provided. Research gaps and directions for future
work, such as having more effective definition of interacting agents in deep
learning methods and the need for gathering more datasets of mixed traffic in
unstructured environments are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Deep-learning-based object detection methods show promise for improving
screening mammography, but high rates of false positives can hinder their
effectiveness in clinical practice. To reduce false positives, we identify
three challenges: (1) unlike natural images, a malignant mammogram typically
contains only one malignant finding; (2) mammography exams contain two views of
each breast, and both views ought to be considered to make a correct
assessment; (3) most mammograms are negative and do not contain any findings.
In this work, we tackle the three aforementioned challenges by: (1) leveraging
Sparse R-CNN and showing that sparse detectors are more appropriate than dense
detectors for mammography; (2) including a multi-view cross-attention module to
synthesize information from different views; (3) incorporating multi-instance
learning (MIL) to train with unannotated images and perform breast-level
classification. The resulting model, M&amp;M, is a Multi-view and Multi-instance
learning system that can both localize malignant findings and provide
breast-level predictions. We validate M&amp;M's detection and classification
performance using five mammography datasets. In addition, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of each proposed component through comprehensive ablation
studies.

<p class="mathjax">Linear Dynamical Systems, both discrete and continuous, are invaluable
mathematical models in a plethora of applications such the verification of
probabilistic systems, model checking, computational biology, cyber-physical
systems, and economics. We consider discrete Linear Recurrence Sequences and
continuous C-finite functions, i.e. solutions to homogeneous Linear
Differential Equations. The Ultimate Positivity Problem gives the recurrence
relation and the initialisation as input and asks whether there is a step $n_0$
(resp. a time $t_0$) such that the Linear Recurrence Sequence $u[n] \ge 0$ for
$n &gt; n_0$ (resp. solution to homogeneous linear differential equation $u(t) \ge
0$ for $t &gt; t_0$). There are intrinsic number-theoretic challenges to surmount
in order to decide these problems, which crucially arise in engineering and the
practical sciences. In these settings, the difficult corner cases are seldom
relevant: tolerance to the inherent imprecision is especially critical. We thus
characterise \textit{robust} instances of the Ultimate Positivity Problem,
i.e.\ inputs for which the decision is locally constant. We describe the sets
of Robust YES and Robust NO instances using the First Order Theory of the
Reals. We show, via the admission of quantifier elimination by the First Order
Theory of the Reals, that these sets are semialgebraic.

<p class="mathjax">As the complexity and computational demands of deep learning models rise, the
need for effective optimization methods for neural network designs becomes
paramount. This work introduces an innovative search mechanism for
automatically selecting the best bit-width and layer-width for individual
neural network layers. This leads to a marked enhancement in deep neural
network efficiency. The search domain is strategically reduced by leveraging
Hessian-based pruning, ensuring the removal of non-crucial parameters.
Subsequently, we detail the development of surrogate models for favorable and
unfavorable outcomes by employing a cluster-based tree-structured Parzen
estimator. This strategy allows for a streamlined exploration of architectural
possibilities and swift pinpointing of top-performing designs. Through rigorous
testing on well-known datasets, our method proves its distinct advantage over
existing methods. Compared to leading compression strategies, our approach
records an impressive 20% decrease in model size without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, our method boasts a 12x reduction in search time relative to the
best search-focused strategies currently available. As a result, our proposed
method represents a leap forward in neural network design optimization, paving
the way for quick model design and implementation in settings with limited
resources, thereby propelling the potential of scalable deep learning
solutions.

<p class="mathjax">A hypothesis class admits a sample compression scheme, if for every sample
labeled by a hypothesis from the class, it is possible to retain only a small
subsample, using which the labels on the entire sample can be inferred. The
size of the compression scheme is an upper bound on the size of the subsample
produced. Every learnable binary hypothesis class (which must necessarily have
finite VC dimension) admits a sample compression scheme of size only a finite
function of its VC dimension, independent of the sample size. For multiclass
hypothesis classes, the analog of VC dimension is the DS dimension. We show
that the analogous statement pertaining to sample compression is not true for
multiclass hypothesis classes: every learnable multiclass hypothesis class,
which must necessarily have finite DS dimension, does not admit a sample
compression scheme of size only a finite function of its DS dimension.

<p class="mathjax">The driver's willingness to give (WTG) control in conditionally automated
driving is assessed in a virtual reality based driving-rig, through their
choice to give away driving control and through the extent to which automated
driving is adopted in a mixed-traffic environment. Within- and across-class
unobserved heterogeneity and locus of control variations are taken into
account. The choice of giving away control is modelled using the mixed logit
(MIXL) and mixed latent class (LCML) model. The significant latent segments of
the locus of control are developed into internalizers and externalizers by the
latent class model (LCM) based on the taste heterogeneity identified from the
MIXL model. Results suggest that drivers choose to "giveAway" control of the
vehicle when greater concentration/attentiveness is required (e.g., in the
nighttime) or when they are interested in performing a non-driving-related task
(NDRT). In addition, it is observed that internalizers demonstrate more
heterogeneity compared to externalizers in terms of WTG.

<p class="mathjax">Through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), disease susceptible genetic
variables can be identified by comparing the genetic data of individuals with
and without a specific disease. However, the discovery of these associations
poses a significant challenge due to genetic heterogeneity and feature
interactions. Genetic variables intertwined with these effects often exhibit
lower effect-size, and thus can be difficult to be detected using machine
learning feature selection methods. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a novel feature selection mechanism for GWAS, named Feature
Co-selection Network (FCSNet). FCS-Net is designed to extract heterogeneous
subsets of genetic variables from a network constructed from multiple
independent feature selection runs based on a genetic algorithm (GA), an
evolutionary learning algorithm. We employ a non-linear machine learning
algorithm to detect feature interaction. We introduce the Community Risk Score
(CRS), a synthetic feature designed to quantify the collective disease
association of each variable subset. Our experiment showcases the effectiveness
of the utilized GA-based feature selection method in identifying feature
interactions through synthetic data analysis. Furthermore, we apply our novel
approach to a case-control colorectal cancer GWAS dataset. The resulting
synthetic features are then used to explain the genetic heterogeneity in an
additional case-only GWAS dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Data complexity analysis quantifies the hardness of constructing a predictive
model on a given dataset. However, the effectiveness of existing data
complexity measures can be challenged by the existence of irrelevant features
and feature interactions in biological micro-array data. We propose a novel
data complexity measure, depth, that leverages an evolutionary inspired feature
selection algorithm to quantify the complexity of micro-array data. By
examining feature subsets of varying sizes, the approach offers a novel
perspective on data complexity analysis. Unlike traditional metrics, depth is
robust to irrelevant features and effectively captures complexity stemming from
feature interactions. On synthetic micro-array data, depth outperforms existing
methods in robustness to irrelevant features and identifying complexity from
feature interactions. Applied to case-control genotype and gene-expression
micro-array datasets, the results reveal that a single feature of
gene-expression data can account for over 90% of the performance of
multi-feature model, confirming the adequacy of the commonly used
differentially expressed gene (DEG) feature selection method for the gene
expression data. Our study also demonstrates that constructing predictive
models for genotype data is harder than gene expression data. The results in
this paper provide evidence for the use of interpretable machine learning
algorithms on microarray data.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of Query Performance Prediction (QPP) for open-domain
multi-hop Question Answering (QA), where the task is to estimate the difficulty
of evaluating a multi-hop question over a corpus. Despite the extensive
research on predicting the performance of ad-hoc and QA retrieval models, there
has been a lack of study on the estimation of the difficulty of multi-hop
questions. The problem is challenging due to the multi-step nature of the
retrieval process, potential dependency of the steps and the reasoning
involved. To tackle this challenge, we propose multHP, a novel pre-retrieval
method for predicting the performance of open-domain multi-hop questions. Our
extensive evaluation on the largest multi-hop QA dataset using several modern
QA systems shows that the proposed model is a strong predictor of the
performance, outperforming traditional single-hop QPP models. Additionally, we
demonstrate that our approach can be effectively used to optimize the
parameters of QA systems, such as the number of documents to be retrieved,
resulting in improved overall retrieval performance.

<p class="mathjax">Spurious correlation caused by subgroup underrepresentation has received
increasing attention as a source of bias that can be perpetuated by deep neural
networks (DNNs). Distributionally robust optimization has shown success in
addressing this bias, although the underlying working mechanism mostly relies
on upweighting under-performing samples as surrogates for those
underrepresented in data. At the same time, while invariant representation
learning has been a powerful choice for removing nuisance-sensitive features,
it has been little considered in settings where spurious correlations are
caused by significant underrepresentation of subgroups. In this paper, we take
the first step to better understand and improve the mechanisms for debiasing
spurious correlation due to subgroup underrepresentation in medical image
classification. Through a comprehensive evaluation study, we first show that 1)
generalized reweighting of under-performing samples can be problematic when
bias is not the only cause for poor performance, while 2) naive invariant
representation learning suffers from spurious correlations itself. We then
present a novel approach that leverages robust optimization to facilitate the
learning of invariant representations at the presence of spurious correlations.
Finetuned classifiers utilizing such representation demonstrated improved
abilities to reduce subgroup performance disparity, while maintaining high
average and worst-group performance.

importance of wellbeing promotion, support, and technique practice that is
effective and accessible. Interactive social robots have been tested to deliver
health programs but have not been explored to deliver wellbeing technique
training in detail. A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted to
explore the feasibility of an autonomous humanoid social robot to deliver a
brief mindful breathing technique to promote information around wellbeing. It
contained two conditions: brief technique training (Technique) and control
designed to represent a simple wait-list activity to represent a
relationship-building discussion (Simple Rapport). This trial also explored
willingness to discuss health-related topics with a robot. Recruitment uptake
rate through convenience sampling was high (53%). A total of 230 participants
took part (mean age = 29 years) with 71% being higher education students. There
were moderate ratings of technique enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and
likelihood to repeat the technique again. Interaction effects were found across
measures with scores varying across gender and distress levels. Males with high
distress and females with low distress who received the simple rapport activity
reported greater comfort to discuss non-health topics than males with low
distress and females with high distress. This trial marks a notable step
towards the design and deployment of an autonomous wellbeing intervention to
investigate the impact of a brief robot-delivered mindfulness training program
for a sub-clinical population.

<p class="mathjax">Maxwell's equations are a collection of coupled partial differential
equations (PDEs) that, together with the Lorentz force law, constitute the
basis of classical electromagnetism and electric circuits. Effectively solving
Maxwell's equations is crucial in various fields, like electromagnetic
scattering and antenna design optimization. Physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) have shown powerful ability in solving PDEs. However, PINNs still
struggle to solve Maxwell's equations in heterogeneous media. To this end, we
propose a domain-adaptive PINN (da-PINN) to solve inverse problems of Maxwell's
equations in heterogeneous media. First, we propose a location parameter of
media interface to decompose the whole domain into several sub-domains.
Furthermore, the electromagnetic interface conditions are incorporated into a
loss function to improve the prediction performance near the interface. Then,
we propose a domain-adaptive training strategy for da-PINN. Finally, the
effectiveness of da-PINN is verified with two case studies.

<p class="mathjax">Graph or network data are widely studied in both data mining and
visualization communities to review the relationship among different entities
and groups. The data facts derived from graph visual analysis are important to
help understand the social structures of complex data, especially for data
journalism. However, it is challenging for data journalists to discover graph
data facts and manually organize correlated facts around a meaningful topic due
to the complexity of graph data and the difficulty to interpret graph
narratives. Therefore, we present an automatic graph facts generation system,
Calliope-Net, which consists of a fact discovery module, a fact organization
module, and a visualization module. It creates annotated node-link diagrams
with facts automatically discovered and organized from network data. A novel
layout algorithm is designed to present meaningful and visually appealing
annotated graphs. We evaluate the proposed system with two case studies and an
in-lab user study. The results show that Calliope-Net can benefit users in
discovering and understanding graph data facts with visually pleasing annotated

<p class="mathjax">Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are gradually adopted by major cloud
providers, offering a practical option of \emph{confidential computing} for
users who don't fully trust public clouds. TEEs use CPU-enabled hardware
features to eliminate direct breaches from compromised operating systems or
hypervisors. However, recent studies have shown that side-channel attacks are
still effective on TEEs. An appealing solution is to convert applications to be
\emph{data oblivious} to deter many side-channel attacks. While a few research
prototypes on TEEs have adopted specific data oblivious operations, the general
conversion approaches have never been thoroughly compared against and tested on
benchmark TEE applications. These limitations make it difficult for researchers
and practitioners to choose and adopt a suitable data oblivious approach for
their applications. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of several representative conversion approaches and implement
benchmark TEE applications with them. We also perform an extensive empirical
study to provide insights into their performance and ease of use.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the neural implementation of complex human behaviors is one of
the major goals in neuroscience. To this end, it is crucial to find a true
representation of the neural data, which is challenging due to the high
complexity of behaviors and the low signal-to-ratio (SNR) of the signals. Here,
we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework, Neural Latent Aligner
(NLA), to find well-constrained, behaviorally relevant neural representations
of complex behaviors. The key idea is to align representations across repeated
trials to learn cross-trial consistent information. Furthermore, we propose a
novel, fully differentiable time warping model (TWM) to resolve the temporal
misalignment of trials. When applied to intracranial electrocorticography
(ECoG) of natural speaking, our model learns better representations for
decoding behaviors than the baseline models, especially in lower dimensional
space. The TWM is empirically validated by measuring behavioral coherence
between aligned trials. The proposed framework learns more cross-trial
consistent representations than the baselines, and when visualized, the
manifold reveals shared neural trajectories across trials.

<p class="mathjax">Tongue segmentation serves as the primary step in automated TCM tongue
diagnosis, which plays a significant role in the diagnostic results. Currently,
numerous deep learning based methods have achieved promising results. However,
most of these methods exhibit mediocre performance on tongues different from
the training set. To address this issue, this paper proposes a universal tongue
segmentation model named TongueSAM based on SAM (Segment Anything Model). SAM
is a large-scale pretrained interactive segmentation model known for its
powerful zero-shot generalization capability. Applying SAM to tongue
segmentation enables the segmentation of various types of tongue images with
zero-shot. In this study, a Prompt Generator based on object detection is
integrated into SAM to enable an end-to-end automated tongue segmentation
method. Experiments demonstrate that TongueSAM achieves exceptional performance
across various of tongue segmentation datasets, particularly under zero-shot.
TongueSAM can be directly applied to other datasets without fine-tuning. As far
as we know, this is the first application of large-scale pretrained model for
tongue segmentation. The project and pretrained model of TongueSAM be publiced
in :https://github.com/cshan-github/TongueSAM.

<p class="mathjax">Trusted Execution Environments, such as Intel SGX, use hardware supports to
ensure the confidentiality and integrity of applications against a compromised
cloud system. However, side channels like access patterns remain for
adversaries to exploit and obtain sensitive information. Common approaches use
oblivious programs or primitives, such as ORAM, to make access patterns
oblivious to input data, which are challenging to develop. This demonstration
shows a prototype SGX-MR-Prot for efficiently protecting access patterns of
SGX-based data-intensive applications and minimizing developers' efforts.
SGX-MR-Prot uses the MapReduce framework to regulate application dataflows to
reduce the cost of access-pattern protection and hide the data oblivious
details from SGX developers. This demonstration will allow users to intuitively
understand the unique contributions of the framework-based protection approach
via interactive exploration and visualization.

<p class="mathjax">Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained popularity in solving
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) via integrating physical laws
into the training of neural networks, making them superior in many scientific
and engineering applications. However, conventional PINNs still fall short in
accurately approximating the solution of complex systems with strong
nonlinearity, especially in long temporal domains. Besides, since PINNs are
designed to approximate a specific realization of a given PDE system, they lack
the necessary generalizability to efficiently adapt to new system
configurations. This entails computationally expensive re-training from scratch
for any new change in the system. To address these shortfalls, in this work a
novel sequential meta-transfer (SMT) learning framework is proposed, offering a
unified solution for both fast training and efficient adaptation of PINNs in
highly nonlinear systems with long temporal domains. Specifically, the
framework decomposes PDE's time domain into smaller time segments to create
"easier" PDE problems for PINNs training. Then for each time interval, a
meta-learner is assigned and trained to achieve an optimal initial state for
rapid adaptation to a range of related tasks. Transfer learning principles are
then leveraged across time intervals to further reduce the computational
cost.Through a composites autoclave processing case study, it is shown that SMT
is clearly able to enhance the adaptability of PINNs while significantly
reducing computational cost, by a factor of 100.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithms for node clustering typically focus on finding homophilous
structure in graphs. That is, they find sets of similar nodes with many edges
within, rather than across, the clusters. However, graphs often also exhibit
heterophilous structure, as exemplified by (nearly) bipartite and tripartite
graphs, where most edges occur across the clusters. Grappling with such
structure is typically left to the task of graph simplification. We present a
probabilistic model based on non-negative matrix factorization which unifies
clustering and simplification, and provides a framework for modeling arbitrary
graph structure. Our model is based on factorizing the process of taking a
random walk on the graph. It permits an unconstrained parametrization, allowing
for optimization via simple gradient descent. By relaxing the hard clustering
to a soft clustering, our algorithm relaxes potentially hard clustering
problems to a tractable ones. We illustrate our algorithm's capabilities on a
synthetic graph, as well as simple unsupervised learning tasks involving
bipartite and tripartite clustering of orthographic and phonological data.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, we introduce an instruction set architecture (ISA) for
processing-in-memory (PIM) based deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. The
proposed ISA is for DNN inference on PIM-based architectures. It is assumed
that the weights have been trained and programmed into PIM-based DNN
accelerators before inference, and they are fixed during inference. We do not
restrict the devices of PIM-based DNN accelerators. Popular devices used to
build PIM-based DNN accelerators include resistive random-access memory (RRAM),
flash, ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET), static random-access
memory (SRAM), etc. The target DNNs include convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The proposed ISA is transparent to
both applications and hardware implementations. It enables to develop unified
toolchains for PIM-based DNN accelerators and software stacks. For practical
hardware that uses a different ISA, the generated instructions by unified
toolchains can easily converted to the target ISA. The proposed ISA has been
used in the open-source DNN compiler PIMCOMP-NN
(https://github.com/sunxt99/PIMCOMP-NN) and the associated open-source
simulator PIMSIM-NN (https://github.com/wangxy-2000/pimsim-nn).

<p class="mathjax">Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) has emerged as a research hotspot
in domains such as conversational robots and question-answer systems. How to
efficiently and adequately retrieve contextual emotional cues has been one of
the key challenges in the ERC task. Existing efforts do not fully model the
context and employ complex network structures, resulting in excessive
computational resource overhead without substantial performance improvement. In
this paper, we propose a novel Emotion Recognition Network based on Curriculum
Learning strategy (ERNetCL). The proposed ERNetCL primarily consists of
Temporal Encoder (TE), Spatial Encoder (SE), and Curriculum Learning (CL) loss.
We utilize TE and SE to combine the strengths of previous methods in a
simplistic manner to efficiently capture temporal and spatial contextual
information in the conversation. To simulate the way humans learn curriculum
from easy to hard, we apply the idea of CL to the ERC task to progressively
optimize the network parameters of ERNetCL. At the beginning of training, we
assign lower learning weights to difficult samples. As the epoch increases, the
learning weights for these samples are gradually raised. Extensive experiments
on four datasets exhibit that our proposed method is effective and dramatically
beats other baseline models.

<p class="mathjax">Mixup is a well-established data augmentation technique, which can extend the
training distribution and regularize the neural networks by creating ''mixed''
samples based on the label-equivariance assumption, i.e., a proportional mixup
of the input data results in the corresponding labels being mixed in the same
proportion. However, previous mixup variants may fail to exploit the
label-independent information in mixed samples during training, which usually
contains richer semantic information. To further release the power of mixup, we
first improve the previous label-equivariance assumption by the
semantic-equivariance assumption, which states that the proportional mixup of
the input data should lead to the corresponding representation being mixed in
the same proportion. Then a generic mixup regularization at the representation
level is proposed, which can further regularize the model with the semantic
information in mixed samples. At a high level, the proposed semantic
equivariant mixup (sem) encourages the structure of the input data to be
preserved in the representation space, i.e., the change of input will result in
the obtained representation information changing in the same way. Different
from previous mixup variants, which tend to over-focus on the label-related
information, the proposed method aims to preserve richer semantic information
in the input with semantic-equivariance assumption, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against distribution shifts. We conduct extensive
empirical studies and qualitative analyzes to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method. The code of the manuscript is in the supplement.

<p class="mathjax">Existing knowledge distillation methods typically work by imparting the
knowledge of output logits or intermediate feature maps from the teacher
network to the student network, which is very successful in multi-class
single-label learning. However, these methods can hardly be extended to the
multi-label learning scenario, where each instance is associated with multiple
semantic labels, because the prediction probabilities do not sum to one and
feature maps of the whole example may ignore minor classes in such a scenario.
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label knowledge distillation method. On
one hand, it exploits the informative semantic knowledge from the logits by
dividing the multi-label learning problem into a set of binary classification
problems; on the other hand, it enhances the distinctiveness of the learned
feature representations by leveraging the structural information of label-wise
embeddings. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets validate that
the proposed method can avoid knowledge counteraction among labels, thus
achieving superior performance against diverse comparing methods. Our code is

<p class="mathjax">Although deep learning techniques have shown significant achievements, they
frequently depend on extensive amounts of hand-labeled data and tend to perform
inadequately in few-shot scenarios. The objective of this study is to devise a
strategy that can improve the model's capability to recognize biomedical
entities in scenarios of few-shot learning. By redefining biomedical named
entity recognition (BioNER) as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem,
we propose a demonstration-based learning method to address few-shot BioNER,
which involves constructing appropriate task demonstrations. In assessing our
proposed method, we compared the proposed method with existing advanced methods
using six benchmark datasets, including BC4CHEMD, BC5CDR-Chemical,
BC5CDR-Disease, NCBI-Disease, BC2GM, and JNLPBA. We examined the models'
efficacy by reporting F1 scores from both the 25-shot and 50-shot learning
experiments. In 25-shot learning, we observed 1.1% improvements in the average
F1 scores compared to the baseline method, reaching 61.7%, 84.1%, 69.1%, 70.1%,
50.6%, and 59.9% on six datasets, respectively. In 50-shot learning, we further
improved the average F1 scores by 1.0% compared to the baseline method,
reaching 73.1%, 86.8%, 76.1%, 75.6%, 61.7%, and 65.4%, respectively. We
reported that in the realm of few-shot learning BioNER, MRC-based language
models are much more proficient in recognizing biomedical entities compared to
the sequence labeling approach. Furthermore, our MRC-language models can
compete successfully with fully-supervised learning methodologies that rely
heavily on the availability of abundant annotated data. These results highlight
possible pathways for future advancements in few-shot BioNER methodologies.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of ChatGPT has introduced innovative methods for information
gathering and analysis. However, the information provided by ChatGPT is limited
to text, and the visualization of this information remains constrained.
Previous research has explored zero-shot text-to-video (TTV) approaches to
transform text into videos. However, these methods lacked control over the
identity of the generated audio, i.e., not identity-agnostic, hindering their
effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage
framework for person-agnostic video cloning, specifically focusing on TTV
generation. In the first stage, we leverage pretrained zero-shot models to
achieve text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. In the second stage, an audio-driven
talking head generation method is employed to produce compelling videos
privided the audio generated in the first stage. This paper presents a
comparative analysis of different TTS and audio-driven talking head generation
methods, identifying the most promising approach for future research and
development. Some audio and videos samples can be found in the following link:

<p class="mathjax">Most prior and current research examining misinformation spread on social
media focuses on reports published by 'fake' news sources. These approaches
fail to capture another potential form of misinformation with a much larger
audience: factual news from mainstream sources ('real' news) repurposed to
promote false or misleading narratives. We operationalize narratives using an
existing unsupervised NLP technique and examine the narratives present in
misinformation content. We find that certain articles from reliable outlets are
shared by a disproportionate number of users who also shared fake news on
Twitter. We consider these 'real' news articles to be co-shared with fake news.
We show that co-shared articles contain existing misinformation narratives at a
significantly higher rate than articles from the same reliable outlets that are
not co-shared with fake news. This holds true even when articles are chosen
following strict criteria of reliability for the outlets and after accounting
for the alternative explanation of partisan curation of articles. For example,
we observe that a recent article published by The Washington Post titled
"Vaccinated people now make up a majority of COVID deaths" was
disproportionately shared by Twitter users with a history of sharing
anti-vaccine false news reports. Our findings suggest a strategic repurposing
of mainstream news by conveyors of misinformation as a way to enhance the reach
and persuasiveness of misleading narratives. We also conduct a comprehensive
case study to help highlight how such repurposing can happen on Twitter as a
consequence of the inclusion of particular narratives in the framing of
mainstream news.

<p class="mathjax">Safety lies at the core of the development of Large Language Models (LLMs).
There is ample work on aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences,
including data filtering in pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement
learning from human feedback, and red teaming, etc. In this study, we discover
that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which
are mainly conducted in natural languages. We propose a novel framework
CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment
to non-natural languages -- ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with
LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot
enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs,
including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across
11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that
certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time to bypass the safety alignment
of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing
safety alignment for non-natural languages. Notably, we identify that LLMs seem
to have a ''secret cipher'', and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role
play and several demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability.
SelfCipher surprisingly outperforms existing human ciphers in almost all cases.
Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/RobustNLP/CipherChat.

<p class="mathjax">Among steganalysis techniques, detection against motion vector (MV)
domain-based video steganography in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)
standard remains a hot and challenging issue. For the purpose of improving the
detection performance, this paper proposes a steganalysis feature based on the
optimality of predicted MVs with a dimension of one. Firstly, we point out that
the motion vector prediction (MVP) of the prediction unit (PU) encoded using
the Advanced Motion Vector Prediction (AMVP) technique satisfies the local
optimality in the cover video. Secondly, we analyze that in HEVC video, message
embedding either using MVP index or motion vector differences (MVD) may destroy
the above optimality of MVP. And then, we define the optimal rate of MVP in
HEVC video as a steganalysis feature. Finally, we conduct steganalysis
detection experiments on two general datasets for three popular steganography
methods and compare the performance with four state-of-the-art steganalysis
methods. The experimental results show that the proposed optimal rate of MVP
for all cover videos is 100\%, while the optimal rate of MVP for all stego
videos is less than 100\%. Therefore, the proposed steganography scheme can
accurately distinguish between cover videos and stego videos, and it is
efficiently applied to practical scenarios with no model training and low
computational complexity.

exponential-family random graph models to analyze the inter-county migration
flow networks in the United States. We introduce a protocol that visualizes the
complex effects of potential underlying mechanisms, and perform in silico
knockout experiments to quantify their contribution to the California Exodus.
We find that racial dynamics contribute to the California Exodus, urbanization
ameliorates it, and political climate and housing costs have little impact.
Moreover, the severity of the California Exodus depends on how one measures it,
and California is not the state with the most substantial population loss. The
paper demonstrates how generative statistical models can provide mechanistic

<p class="mathjax">Non-malleable codes are fundamental objects at the intersection of
cryptography and coding theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in
settings where error correction and detection are impossible, and have found
applications to several other cryptographic tasks. Roughly speaking, a
non-malleable code for a family of tampering functions guarantees that no
adversary can tamper (using functions from this family) the encoding of a given
message into the encoding of a related distinct message. Non-malleable secret
sharing schemes are a strengthening of non-malleable codes which satisfy
additional privacy and reconstruction properties.
<br />We first focus on the $2$-split-state tampering model, one of the strongest
and most well-studied adversarial tampering models. Here, a codeword is split
into two parts which are stored in physically distant servers, and the
adversary can then independently tamper with each part using arbitrary
functions. This model can be naturally extended to the secret sharing setting
with several parties by having the adversary independently tamper with each
share.
<br />Previous works on non-malleable coding and secret sharing in the split-state
tampering model only considered the encoding of \emph{classical} messages.
Furthermore, until the recent work by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (arXiv 2022),
adversaries with quantum capabilities and \emph{shared entanglement} had not
been considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous schemes remain
secure in this model.
<br />In this work, we introduce the notions of split-state non-malleable codes and
secret sharing schemes for quantum messages secure against quantum adversaries
with shared entanglement. We also present explicit constructions of such
schemes that achieve low-error non-malleability.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained prominence in various applications,
such as classification, recognition, and prediction, prompting increased
scrutiny of their properties. A fundamental attribute of traditional DNNs is
their vulnerability to modifications in input data, which has resulted in the
investigation of adversarial attacks. These attacks manipulate the data in
order to mislead a DNN. This study aims to challenge the efficacy and
generalization of contemporary defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
Specifically, we explore the hypothesis proposed by Ilyas et. al, which posits
that DNN image features can be either robust or non-robust, with adversarial
attacks targeting the latter. This hypothesis suggests that training a DNN on a
dataset consisting solely of robust features should produce a model resistant
to adversarial attacks. However, our experiments demonstrate that this is not
universally true. To gain further insights into our findings, we analyze the
impact of adversarial attack norms on DNN representations, focusing on samples
subjected to $L_2$ and $L_{\infty}$ norm attacks. Further, we employ canonical
correlation analysis, visualize the representations, and calculate the mean
distance between these representations and various DNN decision boundaries. Our
results reveal a significant difference between $L_2$ and $L_{\infty}$ norms,
which could provide insights into the potential dangers posed by $L_{\infty}$
norm attacks, previously underestimated by the research community.

<p class="mathjax">Most high-level computer vision tasks rely on low-level image operations as
their initial processes. Operations such as edge detection, image enhancement,
and super-resolution, provide the foundations for higher level image analysis.
In this work we address the edge detection considering three main objectives:
simplicity, efficiency, and generalization since current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) edge detection models are increased in complexity for better accuracy.
To achieve this, we present Tiny and Efficient Edge Detector (TEED), a light
convolutional neural network with only $58K$ parameters, less than $0.2$% of
the state-of-the-art models. Training on the BIPED dataset takes $less than 30
minutes$, with each epoch requiring $less than 5 minutes$. Our proposed model
is easy to train and it quickly converges within very first few epochs, while
the predicted edge-maps are crisp and of high quality. Additionally, we propose
a new dataset to test the generalization of edge detection, which comprises
samples from popular images used in edge detection and image segmentation. The
source code is available in https://github.com/xavysp/TEED.

<p class="mathjax">Spotting user-defined/flexible keywords represented in text frequently uses
an expensive text encoder for joint analysis with an audio encoder in an
embedding space, which can suffer from heterogeneous modality representation
(i.e., large mismatch) and increased complexity. In this work, we propose a
novel architecture to efficiently detect arbitrary keywords based on an
audio-compliant text encoder which inherently has homogeneous representation
with audio embedding, and it is also much smaller than a compatible text
encoder. Our text encoder converts the text to phonemes using a
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model, and then to an embedding using representative
phoneme vectors, extracted from the paired audio encoder on rich speech
datasets. We further augment our method with confusable keyword generation to
develop an audio-text embedding verifier with strong discriminative power.
Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art
results on Libriphrase hard dataset, increasing Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
metric from 84.21% to 92.7% and reducing Equal-Error-Rate (EER) metric from

<p class="mathjax">Conformance is defined as a measure of distance between the behaviors of two
dynamical systems. The notion of conformance can accelerate system design when
models of varying fidelities are available on which analysis and control design
can be done more efficiently. Ultimately, conformance can capture distance
between design models and their real implementations and thus aid in robust
system design. In this paper, we are interested in the conformance of
stochastic dynamical systems. We argue that probabilistic reasoning over the
distribution of distances between model trajectories is a good measure for
stochastic conformance. Additionally, we propose the non-conformance risk to
reason about the risk of stochastic systems not being conformant. We show that
both notions have the desirable transference property, meaning that conformant
systems satisfy similar system specifications, i.e., if the first model
satisfies a desirable specification, the second model will satisfy (nearly) the
same specification. Lastly, we propose how stochastic conformance and the
non-conformance risk can be estimated from data using statistical tools such as
conformal prediction. We present empirical evaluations of our method on an F-16
aircraft, an autonomous vehicle, a spacecraft, and Dubin's vehicle.

<p class="mathjax">Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming potential threats to
security-sensitive areas and personal privacy. A UAV can shoot photos at
height, but how to detect such an uninvited intruder is an open problem. This
paper presents mmHawkeye, a passive approach for UAV detection with a COTS
millimeter wave (mmWave) radar. mmHawkeye doesn't require prior knowledge of
the type, motions, and flight trajectory of the UAV, while exploiting the
signal feature induced by the UAV's periodic micro-motion (PMM) for long-range
accurate detection. The design is therefore effective in dealing with low-SNR
and uncertain reflected signals from the UAV. mmHawkeye can further track the
UAV's position with dynamic programming and particle filtering, and identify it
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based detector. We implement mmHawkeye on
a commercial mmWave radar and evaluate its performance under varied settings.
The experimental results show that mmHawkeye has a detection accuracy of 95.8%
and can realize detection at a range up to 80m.

<p class="mathjax">Event forecasting has been a demanding and challenging task throughout the
entire human history. It plays a pivotal role in crisis alarming and disaster
prevention in various aspects of the whole society. The task of event
forecasting aims to model the relational and temporal patterns based on
historical events and makes forecasting to what will happen in the future. Most
existing studies on event forecasting formulate it as a problem of link
prediction on temporal event graphs. However, such pure structured formulation
suffers from two main limitations: 1) most events fall into general and
high-level types in the event ontology, and therefore they tend to be
coarse-grained and offers little utility which inevitably harms the forecasting
accuracy; and 2) the events defined by a fixed ontology are unable to retain
the out-of-ontology contextual information. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel task of context-aware event forecasting which incorporates
auxiliary contextual information. First, the categorical context provides
supplementary fine-grained information to the coarse-grained events. Second and
more importantly, the context provides additional information towards specific
situation and condition, which is crucial or even determinant to what will
happen next. However, it is challenging to properly integrate context into the
event forecasting framework, considering the complex patterns in the
multi-context scenario. Towards this end, we design a novel framework named
Separation and Collaboration Graph Disentanglement (short as SeCoGD) for
context-aware event forecasting. Since there is no available dataset for this
novel task, we construct three large-scale datasets based on GDELT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms a list of SOTA
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Generally, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are expected to have high performance
when their model size is large. However, large models failed to produce
high-quality results commensurate with their scale in music Super-Resolution
(SR). We attribute this to that DNNs cannot learn information commensurate with
their size from standard mean square error losses. To unleash the potential of
large DNN models in music SR, we propose BigWavGAN, which incorporates Demucs,
a large-scale wave-to-wave model, with State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) discriminators
and adversarial training strategies. Our discriminator consists of Multi-Scale
Discriminator (MSD) and Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD). During inference,
since only the generator is utilized, there are no additional parameters or
computational resources required compared to the baseline model Demucs.
Objective evaluation affirms the effectiveness of BigWavGAN in music SR.
Subjective evaluations indicate that BigWavGAN can generate music with
significantly high perceptual quality over the baseline model. Notably,
BigWavGAN surpasses the SOTA music SR model in both simulated and real-world
scenarios. Moreover, BigWavGAN represents its superior generalization ability
to address out-of-distribution data. The conducted ablation study reveals the
importance of our discriminators and training strategies. Samples are available

<p class="mathjax">Delaunay Triangulation(DT) is one of the important geometric problems that is
used in various branches of knowledge such as computer vision, terrain
modeling, spatial clustering and networking. Kinetic data structures have
become very important in computational geometry for dealing with moving
objects. However, when dealing with moving points, maintaining a dynamically
changing Delaunay triangulation can be challenging. So, In this case, we have
to update triangulation repeatedly. If points move so far, it is better to
rebuild the triangulation. One approach to handle moving points is to use an
incremental algorithm. For the case that points move slowly, we can give a
faster algorithm than rebuilding it. Furthermore, sequential algorithms can be
computationally expensive for large datasets. So, one way to compute as fast as
possible is parallelism. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm for
moving points. we propose an algorithm that divides datasets into equal
partitions and give every partition to one block. Each block satisfay the
Delaunay constraints after each time step and uses delete and insert algorithms
to do this. We show this algorithm works faster than serial algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge Graph (KG)-to-Text generation aims at generating fluent
natural-language text that accurately represents the information of a given
knowledge graph. While significant progress has been made in this task by
exploiting the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs) with appropriate
graph structure-aware modules, existing models still fall short of generating
faithful text, especially when the ground-truth natural-language text contains
additional information that is not present in the graph. In this paper, we
develop a KG-to-text generation model that can generate faithful
natural-language text from a given graph, in the presence of noisy reference
text. Our framework incorporates two core ideas: Firstly, we utilize
contrastive learning to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between
faithful and hallucinated information in the text, thereby encouraging the
decoder to generate text that aligns with the input graph. Secondly, we empower
the decoder to control the level of hallucination in the generated text by
employing a controllable text generation technique. We evaluate our model's
performance through the standard quantitative metrics as well as a
ChatGPT-based quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our evaluation
demonstrates the superior performance of our model over state-of-the-art
KG-to-text models on faithfulness.

<p class="mathjax">Full-body ego-pose estimation from head and hand poses alone has become an
active area of research to power articulate avatar representation on
headset-based platforms. However, existing methods over-rely on the confines of
the motion-capture spaces in which datasets were recorded, while simultaneously
assuming continuous capture of joint motions and uniform body dimensions. In
this paper, we propose EgoPoser, which overcomes these limitations by 1)
rethinking the input representation for headset-based ego-pose estimation and
introducing a novel motion decomposition method that predicts full-body pose
independent of global positions, 2) robustly modeling body pose from
intermittent hand position and orientation tracking only when inside a
headset's field of view, and 3) generalizing across various body sizes for
different users. Our experiments show that EgoPoser outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while
maintaining a high inference speed of over 600 fps. EgoPoser establishes a
robust baseline for future work, where full-body pose estimation needs no
longer rely on outside-in capture and can scale to large-scene environments.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) can lead to significant communication overhead and
reliance on a central server. To address these challenges, decentralized
federated learning (DFL) has been proposed as a more resilient framework. DFL
involves parameter exchange between devices through a wireless network. This
study analyzes the performance of resource-constrained DFL using different
communication schemes (digital and analog) over wireless networks to optimize
communication efficiency. Specifically, we provide convergence bounds for both
digital and analog transmission approaches, enabling analysis of the model
performance trained on DFL. Furthermore, for digital transmission, we
investigate and analyze resource allocation between computation and
communication and convergence rates, obtaining its communication complexity and
the minimum probability of correction communication required for convergence
guarantee. For analog transmission, we discuss the impact of channel fading and
noise on the model performance and the maximum errors accumulation with
convergence guarantee over fading channels. Finally, we conduct numerical
simulations to evaluate the performance and convergence rate of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) trained in the DFL
framework on fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our simulation results
validate our analysis and discussion, revealing how to improve performance by
optimizing system parameters under different communication conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Perspective-taking is the ability to perceive or understand a situation or
concept from another individual's point of view, and is crucial in daily human
interactions. Enabling robots to perform perspective-taking remains an unsolved
problem; existing approaches that use deterministic or handcrafted methods are
unable to accurately account for uncertainty in partially-observable settings.
This work proposes to address this limitation via a deep world model that
enables a robot to perform both perception and conceptual perspective taking,
i.e., the robot is able to infer what a human sees and believes. The key
innovation is a decomposed multi-modal latent state space model able to
generate and augment fictitious observations/emissions. Optimizing the ELBO
that arises from this probabilistic graphical model enables the learning of
uncertainty in latent space, which facilitates uncertainty estimation from
high-dimensional observations. We tasked our model to predict human
observations and beliefs on three partially-observable HRI tasks. Experiments
show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines and is able
to infer visual observations available to other agent and their internal
beliefs.

<p class="mathjax">Interpolation models are critical for a wide range of applications, from
numerical optimization to artificial intelligence. The reliability of the
provided interpolated value is of utmost importance, and it is crucial to avoid
the insurgence of spurious noise. Noise sources can be prevented using proper
countermeasures when the training set is designed, but the data sparsity is
inevitable in some cases. A typical example is represented by the application
of an optimization algorithm: the area where the minimum or maximum of the
objective function is assumed to be present is where new data is abundantly
added, but other areas of design variable space are significantly neglected. In
these cases, a regularization of the interpolation model becomes absolutely
crucial. In this paper we are presenting an approach for the regularization of
an interpolator based on the control of its kernel function via the condition
number of the self-correlation matrix.

<p class="mathjax">Hot news is one of the most popular topics in daily conversations. However,
news grounded conversation has long been stymied by the lack of well-designed
task definition and scarce data. In this paper, we propose a novel task,
Proactive News Grounded Conversation, in which a dialogue system can
proactively lead the conversation based on some key topics of the news. In
addition, both information-seeking and chit-chat scenarios are included
realistically, where the user may ask a series of questions about the news
details or express their opinions and be eager to chat. To further develop this
novel task, we collect a human-to-human Chinese dialogue dataset
\ts{NewsDialogues}, which includes 1K conversations with a total of 14.6K
utterances and detailed annotations for target topics and knowledge spans.
Furthermore, we propose a method named Predict-Generate-Rank, consisting of a
generator for grounded knowledge prediction and response generation, and a
ranker for the ranking of multiple responses to alleviate the exposure bias. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method and further present several key findings and challenges to

sense a target from the same wide view to obtain homogeneous noise-corrupted
sensory data, from which the local feature vectors are extracted. All local
feature vectors are aggregated at the server using over-the-air computation
(AirComp) in a broadband channel with the
orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing technique for suppressing the
sensing and channel noise. The aggregated denoised global feature vector is
further input to a server-side AI model for completing the downstream inference
task. A novel task-oriented design criterion, called maximum minimum pair-wise
discriminant gain, is adopted for classification tasks. It extends the distance
of the closest class pair in the feature space, leading to a balanced and
enhanced inference accuracy. Under this criterion, a problem of joint sensing
power assignment, transmit precoding and receive beamforming is formulated. The
challenge lies in three aspects: the coupling between sensing and AirComp, the
joint optimization of all feature dimensions' AirComp aggregation over a
broadband channel, and the complicated form of the maximum minimum pair-wise
discriminant gain. To solve this problem, a task-oriented ISCC scheme with
AirComp is proposed. Experiments based on a human motion recognition task are
conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed scheme over the existing
scheme and a baseline.

<p class="mathjax">Information-seeking conversation, which aims to help users gather information
through conversation, has achieved great progress in recent years. However, the
research is still stymied by the scarcity of training data. To alleviate this
problem, we propose AutoConv for synthetic conversation generation, which takes
advantage of the few-shot learning ability and generation capacity of large
language models (LLM). Specifically, we formulate the conversation generation
problem as a language modeling task, then finetune an LLM with a few human
conversations to capture the characteristics of the information-seeking process
and use it for generating synthetic conversations with high quality.
Experimental results on two frequently-used datasets verify that AutoConv has
substantial improvements over strong baselines and alleviates the dependence on
human annotation. In addition, we also provide several analysis studies to
promote future research.

<p class="mathjax">The object of this paper is to study two very important classes of codes in
coding theory, namely self-orthogonal (SO) and linear complementary dual (LCD)
codes under the symplectic inner product, involving characterization,
constructions, and their application. Using such a characterization, we
determine the mass formulas of symplectic SO and LCD codes by considering the
action of the symplectic group, and further obtain some asymptotic results.
Finally, under the Hamming distance, we obtain some symplectic SO (resp. LCD)
codes with improved parameters directly compared with Euclidean SO (resp. LCD)
codes. Under the symplectic distance, we obtain some additive SO (resp.
additive complementary dual) codes with improved parameters directly compared
with Hermitian SO (resp. LCD) codes. Further, we also construct many good
additive codes outperform the best-known linear codes in Grassl's code table.
As an application, we construct a number of record-breaking
(entanglement-assisted) quantum error-correcting codes, which improve Grassl's
code table.

<p class="mathjax">It is a conundrum that agile projects can succeed 'without requirements' when
weak requirements engineering is a known cause for project failures. While
Agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements
documentation, test cases are commonly used as requirements. We have
investigated this agile practice at three companies in order to understand how
test cases can fill the role of requirements. We performed a case study based
on twelve interviews performed in a previous study. The findings include a
range of benefits and challenges in using test cases for eliciting, validating,
verifying, tracing and managing requirements. In addition, we identified three
scenarios for applying the practice, namely as a mature practice, as a de facto
practice and as part of an agile transition. The findings provide insights into
how the role of requirements may be met in agile development including
challenges to consider.

<p class="mathjax">Detailed anatomical information is essential to optimize medical decisions
for surgical and pre-operative planning in patients with congenital heart
disease. The visualization techniques commonly used in clinical routine for the
exploration of complex cardiac data are based on multi-planar reformations,
maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering, which rely on basic
lighting models prone to image distortion. On the other hand, cinematic
rendering (CR), a three-dimensional visualization technique based on
physically-based rendering methods, can create volumetric images with high
fidelity. However, there are a lot of parameters involved in CR that affect the
visualization results, thus being dependent on the user's experience and
requiring detailed evaluation protocols to compare available solutions. In this
study, we have analyzed the impact of the most relevant parameters in a CR
pipeline developed in the open-source version of the MeVisLab framework for the
visualization of the heart anatomy of three congenital patients and two adults
from CT images. The resulting visualizations were compared to a commercial tool
used in the clinics with a questionnaire filled in by clinical users, providing
similar definitions of structures, depth perception, texture appearance,
realism, and diagnostic ability.

<p class="mathjax">Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) extend standard knowledge graphs by
associating attribute-value qualifiers to triples, which effectively represent
additional fine-grained information about its associated triple.
Hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) aims at inferring unknown
triples while considering its qualifiers. Most existing approaches to HKGC
exploit a global-level graph structure to encode hyper-relational knowledge
into the graph convolution message passing process. However, the addition of
multi-hop information might bring noise into the triple prediction process. To
address this problem, we propose HyperFormer, a model that considers
local-level sequential information, which encodes the content of the entities,
relations and qualifiers of a triple. More precisely, HyperFormer is composed
of three different modules: an entity neighbor aggregator module allowing to
integrate the information of the neighbors of an entity to capture different
perspectives of it; a relation qualifier aggregator module to integrate
hyper-relational knowledge into the corresponding relation to refine the
representation of relational content; a convolution-based bidirectional
interaction module based on a convolutional operation, capturing pairwise
bidirectional interactions of entity-relation, entity-qualifier, and
relation-qualifier. realize the depth perception of the content related to the
current statement. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy into
the feed-forward layers of HyperFormer to strengthen its representation
capabilities while reducing the amount of model parameters and computation.
Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets with four different
conditions demonstrate HyperFormer's effectiveness. Datasets and code are
available at https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/HKGC-HyperFormer.

<p class="mathjax">Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) significantly influences network incentives,
consensus safety, and economic dynamics, and has been extensively studied
within the Ethereum blockchain domain. However, MEV is not specific to
Ethereum, and extends to other blockchain platforms with differing properties,
such as Algorand. Algorand, a smart-contract-based blockchain employing a
Byzantine-Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism and Pure-Proof-of-Stake, is
characterized by a First-Come-First-Serve transaction ordering mechanism and
minimal fixed transaction fees. This paper provides the first exploration of
the MEV landscape on Algorand, focusing on arbitrage MEV patterns, key actors,
their strategic preferences, transaction positioning strategies, and the
influence of Algorand's network infrastructure on MEV searching. We observed
1,142,970 arbitrage cases, with a single searcher executing 653,001. Different
searchers demonstrated diverse strategies, reflected in the varied distribution
of profitable block positions. Nonetheless, the even spread of arbitrage
positions across a block indicates an emphasis on immediate backrunning
executions. Furthermore, we identified 265,637 instances of Batch Transaction
Issuances, where an address occupied over 80% of a block with a singular
transaction type.

<p class="mathjax">Deploying high-performance convolutional neural network (CNN) models on
low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites for rapid remote sensing image processing has
attracted significant interest from industry and academia. However, the limited
resources available on LEO satellites contrast with the demands of
resource-intensive CNN models, necessitating the adoption of ground-station
server assistance for training and updating these models. Existing approaches
often require large floating-point operations (FLOPs) and substantial model
parameter transmissions, presenting considerable challenges. To address these
issues, this paper introduces a ground-station server-assisted framework. With
the proposed framework, each layer of the CNN model contains only one learnable
feature map (called the seed feature map) from which other feature maps are
generated based on specific rules. The hyperparameters of these rules are
randomly generated instead of being trained, thus enabling the generation of
multiple feature maps from the seed feature map and significantly reducing
FLOPs. Furthermore, since the random hyperparameters can be saved using a few
random seeds, the ground station server assistance can be facilitated in
updating the CNN model deployed on the LEO satellite. Experimental results on
the ISPRS Vaihingen, ISPRS Potsdam, UAVid, and LoveDA datasets for semantic
segmentation services demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, the SineFM-based model
achieves a higher mIoU than the UNetFormer on the UAVid dataset, with 3.3x
fewer parameters and 2.2x fewer FLOPs.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce the concept of Density-Balanced Subset in a
matroid, in which independent sets can be sampled so as to guarantee that (i)
each element has the same probability to be sampled, and (ii) those events are
negatively correlated. These Density-Balanced Subsets are subsets in the ground
set of a matroid in which the traditional notion of uniform random sampling can
be extended. We then provide an application of this concept to the
Matroid-Constrained Maximum Coverage problem. In this problem, given a matroid
$\mathcal{M} = (V, \mathcal{I})$ of rank $k$ on a ground set $V$ and a coverage
function $f$ on $V$, the goal is to find an independent set $S \in \mathcal{I}$
maximizing $f(S)$. This problem is an important special case of the
much-studied submodular function maximization problem subject to a matroid
constraint; this is also a generalization of the maximum $k$-cover problem in a
graph. In this paper, assuming that the coverage function has a bounded
frequency $\mu$ (i.e., any element of the underlying universe of the coverage
function appears in at most $\mu$ sets), we design a procedure, parameterized
by some integer $\rho$, to extract in polynomial time an approximate kernel of
size $\rho \cdot k$ that is guaranteed to contain a $1 - (\mu - 1)/\rho$
approximation of the optimal solution. This procedure can then be used to get a
Fixed-Parameter Tractable Approximation Scheme (FPT-AS) providing a $1 -
\varepsilon$ approximation in time $(\mu/\varepsilon)^{O(k)} \cdot |V|^{O(1)}$.
This generalizes and improves the results of [Manurangsi, 2019] and [Huang and
Sellier, 2022], providing the first FPT-AS working on an arbitrary matroid.
Moreover, because of its simplicity, the kernel construction can be performed
in the streaming setting.

<p class="mathjax">Transfer learning via fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models has gained
significant success in delivering state-of-the-art results across various NLP
tasks. In the absence of centralized data, Federated Learning (FL) can benefit
from distributed and private data of the FL edge clients for fine-tuning.
However, due to the limited communication, computation, and storage
capabilities of edge devices and the huge sizes of popular transformer models,
efficient fine-tuning is crucial to make federated training feasible. This work
explores the opportunities and challenges associated with applying parameter
efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods in different FL settings for language
tasks. Specifically, our investigation reveals that as the data across users
becomes more diverse, the gap between fully fine-tuning the model and employing
PEFT methods widens. To bridge this performance gap, we propose a method called
SLoRA, which overcomes the key limitations of LoRA in high heterogeneous data
scenarios through a novel data-driven initialization technique. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SLoRA achieves performance comparable to
full fine-tuning, with significant sparse updates with approximately $\sim 1\%$
density while reducing training time by up to $90\%$.

<p class="mathjax">One of the challenges in learning to perform abstract reasoning is that
problems are often posed as monolithic tasks, with no intermediate subgoals. In
Raven Progressive Matrices (RPM), the task is to choose one of the available
answers given a context, where both contexts and answers are composite images
featuring multiple objects in various spatial arrangements. As this high-level
goal is the only guidance available, learning is challenging and most
contemporary solvers tend to be opaque. In this study, we propose a deep
learning architecture based on the transformer blueprint which, rather than
directly making the above choice, predicts the visual properties of individual
objects and their arrangements. The multidimensional predictions obtained in
this way are then directly juxtaposed to choose the answer. We consider a few
ways in which the model parses the visual input into tokens and several regimes
of masking parts of the input in self-supervised training. In experimental
assessment, the models not only outperform state-of-the-art methods but also
provide interesting insights and partial explanations about the inference. The
design of the method also makes it immune to biases that are known to exist in
some RPM benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we develop an efficient spectral-Galerkin-type search
extension method (SGSEM) for finding multiple solutions to semilinear elliptic
boundary value problems. This method constructs effective initial data for
multiple solutions based on the linear combinations of some eigenfunctions of
the corresponding linear eigenvalue problem, and thus takes full advantage of
the traditional search extension method in constructing initials for multiple
solutions. Meanwhile, it possesses a low computational cost and high accuracy
due to the employment of an interpolated coefficient Legendre-Galerkin spectral
discretization. By applying the Schauder's fixed point theorem and other
technical strategies, the existence and spectral convergence of the numerical
solution corresponding to a specified true solution are rigorously proved. In
addition, the uniqueness of the numerical solution in a sufficiently small
neighborhood of each specified true solution is strictly verified. Numerical
results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our algorithm and present
different types of multiple solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to exploit the
complementarity of 2D-3D data to overcome the lack of annotation in a new
domain. However, UDA methods rely on access to the target domain during
training, meaning the trained model only works in a specific target domain. In
light of this, we propose cross-modal learning under bird's-eye view for Domain
Generalization (DG) of 3D semantic segmentation, called BEV-DG. DG is more
challenging because the model cannot access the target domain during training,
meaning it needs to rely on cross-modal learning to alleviate the domain gap.
Since 3D semantic segmentation requires the classification of each point,
existing cross-modal learning is directly conducted point-to-point, which is
sensitive to the misalignment in projections between pixels and points. To this
end, our approach aims to optimize domain-irrelevant representation modeling
with the aid of cross-modal learning under bird's-eye view. We propose
BEV-based Area-to-area Fusion (BAF) to conduct cross-modal learning under
bird's-eye view, which has a higher fault tolerance for point-level
misalignment. Furthermore, to model domain-irrelevant representations, we
propose BEV-driven Domain Contrastive Learning (BDCL) with the help of
cross-modal learning under bird's-eye view. We design three domain
generalization settings based on three 3D datasets, and BEV-DG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art competitors with tremendous margins in all
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Current closed-set instance segmentation models rely on pre-defined class
labels for each mask during training and evaluation, largely limiting their
ability to detect novel objects. Open-world instance segmentation (OWIS) models
address this challenge by detecting unknown objects in a class-agnostic manner.
However, previous OWIS approaches completely erase category information during
training to keep the model's ability to generalize to unknown objects. In this
work, we propose a novel training mechanism termed SegPrompt that uses category
information to improve the model's class-agnostic segmentation ability for both
known and unknown categories. In addition, the previous OWIS training setting
exposes the unknown classes to the training set and brings information leakage,
which is unreasonable in the real world. Therefore, we provide a new open-world
benchmark closer to a real-world scenario by dividing the dataset classes into
known-seen-unseen parts. For the first time, we focus on the model's ability to
discover objects that never appear in the training set images.
<br />Experiments show that SegPrompt can improve the overall and unseen detection
performance by 5.6% and 6.1% in AR on our new benchmark without affecting the
inference efficiency. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
existing cross-dataset transfer and strongly supervised settings, leading to
5.5% and 12.3% relative improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning in medical imaging has the potential to minimize the risk of
diagnostic errors, reduce radiologist workload, and accelerate diagnosis.
Training such deep learning models requires large and accurate datasets, with
annotations for all training samples. However, in the medical imaging domain,
annotated datasets for specific tasks are often small due to the high
complexity of annotations, limited access, or the rarity of diseases. To
address this challenge, deep learning models can be pre-trained on large image
datasets without annotations using methods from the field of self-supervised
learning. After pre-training, small annotated datasets are sufficient to
fine-tune the models for a specific task, the so-called ``downstream task". The
most popular self-supervised pre-training approaches in medical imaging are
based on contrastive learning. However, recent studies in natural image
processing indicate a strong potential for masked autoencoder approaches. Our
work compares state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods with the recently
introduced masked autoencoder approach "SparK" for convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) on medical images. Therefore we pre-train on a large
unannotated CT image dataset and fine-tune on several downstream CT
classification tasks. Due to the challenge of obtaining sufficient annotated
training data in the medical imaging domain, it is of particular interest to
evaluate how the self-supervised pre-training methods perform on small
downstream datasets. By experimenting with gradually reducing the training
dataset size of our downstream tasks, we find that the reduction has different
effects depending on the type of pre-training chosen. The SparK pre-training
method is more robust to the training dataset size than the contrastive
methods. Based on our results, we propose the SparK pre-training for medical
downstream tasks with small datasets.

provenance in workflows that convert both category labels and associated
numeric data between distinct but semantically related taxonomies. We motivate
the graphical representations with a new task abstraction, the cross-taxonomy
transformation, and associated graph-based information structure, the crossmap.
The task abstraction supports the separation of category recoding and numeric

conversion of numeric statistics from a country-specific taxonomy to an

<p class="mathjax">The accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs) in urban areas is influenced
by numerous factors including land cover and terrain irregularities. Moreover,
building artifacts in global DEMs cause artificial blocking of surface flow
pathways. This compromises their quality and adequacy for hydrological and
environmental modelling in urban landscapes where precise and accurate terrain
information is needed. In this study, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
ensemble algorithm is adopted for enhancing the accuracy of two
medium-resolution 30m DEMs over Cape Town, South Africa: Copernicus GLO-30 and
ALOS World 3D (AW3D). XGBoost is a scalable, portable and versatile gradient
boosting library that can solve many environmental modelling problems. The
training datasets are comprised of eleven predictor variables including
elevation, urban footprints, slope, aspect, surface roughness, topographic
position index, terrain ruggedness index, terrain surface texture, vector
roughness measure, forest cover and bare ground cover. The target variable
(elevation error) was calculated with respect to highly accurate airborne
LiDAR. After training and testing, the model was applied for correcting the
DEMs at two implementation sites. The correction achieved significant accuracy
gains which are competitive with other proposed methods. The root mean square
error (RMSE) of Copernicus DEM improved by 46 to 53% while the RMSE of AW3D DEM
improved by 72 to 73%. These results showcase the potential of gradient boosted
trees for enhancing the quality of DEMs, and for improved hydrological
modelling in urban catchments.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting meaningful drug-related information chunks, such as adverse drug
events (ADE), is crucial for preventing morbidity and saving many lives. Most
ADE are reported via an unstructured conversation with the medical context.
Hence, applying a general entity recognition approach is not sufficient enough.
The key is how to integrate and align multiple crucial aspects to detect drug
event information, including drug event semantics, syntactic structures, and
medical domain terminology. In this paper, we propose a new multi-aspect
cross-integration framework for drug entity/event detection by capturing and
aligning different context/language/knowledge properties from drug-related
documents. We first construct multi-aspect encoders to describe semantic,
syntactic, and medical document contextual information by conducting those slot
tagging tasks, main drug entity/event detection, part-of-speech tagging, and
general medical named entity recognition. Then, each encoder conducts cross
integration and alignment with other contextual information in three ways,
including the key-value cross, attention cross, and feedforward cross, so the
multi-encoders are integrated in depth. Then, we perform extensive experiments
on two widely used drug-related entity recognition downstream tasks, flat
entity detection and discontinuous event extraction. Our model significantly
outperforms all recent twelve state-of-the-art models. The implementation code
will be released at~\url{https://github.com/adlnlp/mc-dre}.

<p class="mathjax">Vision Transformers (ViTs) are normally regarded as a stack of transformer
layers. In this work, we propose a novel view of ViTs showing that they can be
seen as ensemble networks containing multiple parallel paths with different
lengths. Specifically, we equivalently transform the traditional cascade of
multi-head self-attention (MSA) and feed-forward network (FFN) into three
parallel paths in each transformer layer. Then, we utilize the identity
connection in our new transformer form and further transform the ViT into an
explicit multi-path ensemble network. From the new perspective, these paths
perform two functions: the first is to provide the feature for the classifier
directly, and the second is to provide the lower-level feature representation
for subsequent longer paths. We investigate the influence of each path for the
final prediction and discover that some paths even pull down the performance.
Therefore, we propose the path pruning and EnsembleScale skills for
improvement, which cut out the underperforming paths and re-weight the ensemble
components, respectively, to optimize the path combination and make the short
paths focus on providing high-quality representation for subsequent paths. We
also demonstrate that our path combination strategies can help ViTs go deeper
and act as high-pass filters to filter out partial low-frequency signals. To
further enhance the representation of paths served for subsequent paths,
self-distillation is applied to transfer knowledge from the long paths to the
short paths. This work calls for more future research to explain and design
ViTs from new perspectives.

<p class="mathjax">The traditional dietary recommendation systems are basically nutrition or
health-aware where the human feelings on food are ignored. Human affects vary
when it comes to food cravings, and not all foods are appealing in all moods. A
questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal recommendation system can be a
solution. However, automated recognition of social affects on different foods
and planning the menu considering nutritional demand and social-affect has some
significant benefits of the questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal
recommendations. A patient with severe illness, a person in a coma, or patients
with locked-in syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cannot express
their meal preferences. Therefore, the proposed framework includes a
social-affective computing module to recognize the affects of different meals
where the person's affect is detected using electroencephalography signals. EEG
allows to capture the brain signals and analyze them to anticipate affective
toward a food. In this study, we have used a 14-channel wireless Emotive Epoc+
to measure affectivity for different food items. A hierarchical ensemble method
is applied to predict affectivity upon multiple feature extraction methods and
TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is
used to generate a food list based on the predicted affectivity. In addition to
the meal recommendation, an automated menu planning approach is also proposed
considering a person's energy intake requirement, affectivity, and nutritional
values of the different menus. The bin-packing algorithm is used for the
personalized menu planning of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. The
experimental findings reveal that the suggested affective computing, meal
recommendation, and menu planning algorithms perform well across a variety of
assessment parameters.

<p class="mathjax">The growing demand for short-term property renting has led to the boom of a
new category called PropTech (Property + Technology). Such a rise in demand
attracted many entrepreneurs and investors leading to the inception of powerful
and centralised players in the category (like Airbnb). Unfortunately, some big
players are controlling the entire industry in a centralised way in turn,
performing anti-competitive practices which leave no room for the small
players. Such an ecosystem can be made more transparent and decentralised by
executing transactions and order-fulfilment on a blockchain. To extend the
functionality of the system, we can also perform the renting of small services
and appliances via the integration of IoT. Implementing such a system will make
the process more transparent, robust and decentralised.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-lingual open information extraction aims to extract structured
information from raw text across multiple languages. Previous work uses a
shared cross-lingual pre-trained model to handle the different languages but
underuses the potential of the language-specific representation. In this paper,
we propose an effective multi-stage tuning framework called MT4CrossIE,
designed for enhancing cross-lingual open information extraction by injecting
language-specific knowledge into the shared model. Specifically, the
cross-lingual pre-trained model is first tuned in a shared semantic space
(e.g., embedding matrix) in the fixed encoder and then other components are
optimized in the second stage. After enough training, we freeze the pre-trained
model and tune the multiple extra low-rank language-specific modules using
mixture-of-LoRAs for model-based cross-lingual transfer. In addition, we
leverage two-stage prompting to encourage the large language model (LLM) to
annotate the multi-lingual raw data for data-based cross-lingual transfer. The
model is trained with multi-lingual objectives on our proposed dataset
OpenIE4++ by combing the model-based and data-based transfer techniques.
Experimental results on various benchmarks emphasize the importance of
aggregating multiple plug-in-and-play language-specific modules and demonstrate
the effectiveness of MT4CrossIE in cross-lingual
OIE\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CSJianYang/Multilingual-Multimodal-NLP}}.

<p class="mathjax">Despite recent advances in 3D human mesh reconstruction, domain gap between
training and test data is still a major challenge. Several prior works tackle
the domain gap problem via test-time adaptation that fine-tunes a network
relying on 2D evidence (e.g., 2D human keypoints) from test images. However,
the high reliance on 2D evidence during adaptation causes two major issues.
First, 2D evidence induces depth ambiguity, preventing the learning of accurate
3D human geometry. Second, 2D evidence is noisy or partially non-existent
during test time, and such imperfect 2D evidence leads to erroneous adaptation.
To overcome the above issues, we introduce CycleAdapt, which cyclically adapts
two networks: a human mesh reconstruction network (HMRNet) and a human motion
denoising network (MDNet), given a test video. In our framework, to alleviate
high reliance on 2D evidence, we fully supervise HMRNet with generated 3D
supervision targets by MDNet. Our cyclic adaptation scheme progressively
elaborates the 3D supervision targets, which compensate for imperfect 2D
evidence. As a result, our CycleAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to previous test-time adaptation methods. The codes are available at
https://github.com/hygenie1228/CycleAdapt_RELEASE.

<p class="mathjax">Attribute-based Credential Systems (ACS) have been long proposed as
privacy-preserving means of attribute-based authentication, yet neither been
considered particularly usable nor found wide-spread adoption, to date. To
establish what variables drive the adoption of \ACS as a usable security and
privacy technology, we investigated how intrinsic and presentation properties
impact their perceived trustworthiness and behavioral intent to adopt them. We
conducted two confirmatory, fractional-factorial, between-subject,
random-controlled trials with a total UK-representative sample of $N = 812$
participants. Each participant inspected one of 24 variants of Anonymous
Credential System Web site, which encoded a combination of three intrinsic
factors (\textsf{provider}, \textsf{usage}, \textsf{benefits}) and three
presentation factors (\textsf{simplicity}, presence of \textsf{people}, level
of available \textsf{support}). Participants stated their privacy and
faith-in-technology subjective norms before the trial. After having completed
the Web site inspection, they reported on the perceived trustworthiness, the
technology adoption readiness, and their behavioral intention to follow
through. We established a robust covariance-based structural equation model of
the perceived trustworthiness and technology acceptance, showing that
communicating facilitating conditions as well as demonstrating results drive
the overall acceptance and behavioral intent. Of the manipulated causal
variables, communicating with simplicity and on the everyday usage had the
greatest and most consistently positive impact on the overall technology
acceptance. After earlier correlational empirical research on ACS technology
acceptance, ours is the first research showing cause-effect relations in a
structural latent factor model with substantial sample size.

<p class="mathjax">Music retrieval and recommendation applications often rely on content
features encoded as embeddings, which provide vector representations of items
in a music dataset. Numerous complementary embeddings can be derived from
processing items originally represented in several modalities, e.g., audio
signals, user interaction data, or editorial data. However, data of any given
modality might not be available for all items in any music dataset. In this
work, we propose a method based on contrastive learning to combine embeddings
from multiple modalities and explore the impact of the presence or absence of
embeddings from diverse modalities in an artist similarity task. Experiments on
two datasets suggest that our contrastive method outperforms single-modality
embeddings and baseline algorithms for combining modalities, both in terms of
artist retrieval accuracy and coverage. Improvements with respect to other
methods are particularly significant for less popular query artists. We
demonstrate our method successfully combines complementary information from
diverse modalities, and is more robust to missing modality data (i.e., it
better handles the retrieval of artists with different modality embeddings than
the query artist's).

<p class="mathjax">The ancestral maximum-likelihood and phylogeography problems are two
fundamental problems involving evolutionary studies. The ancestral
maximum-likelihood problem involves identifying a rooted tree alongside
internal node sequences that maximizes the probability of observing a given set
of sequences as leaves. The phylogeography problem extends the ancestral
maximum-likelihood problem to incorporate geolocation of leaf and internal
nodes. While a constant factor approximation algorithm has been established for
the ancestral maximum-likelihood problem concerning two-state sequences, no
such algorithm has been devised for any generalized instances of the problem.
In this paper, we focus on a generalization of the two-state model, the time
reversible Markov evolutionary models for sequences and geolocations. Under
this evolutionary model, we present a $2\log_2 k $-approximation algorithm,
where $k$ is the number of input samples, addressing both the ancestral
maximum-likelihood and phylogeography problems. This is the first approximation
algorithm for the phylogeography problem. Furthermore, we show how to apply the
algorithm on popular evolutionary models like generalized time-reversible (GTR)
model and its specialization Jukes and Cantor 69 (JC69).

<p class="mathjax">Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for the safe and efficient
operation of autonomous vehicles. The growing popularity of deep learning has
led to the development of numerous methods for trajectory prediction. While
deterministic deep learning models have been widely used, deep generative
models have gained popularity as they learn data distributions from training
data and account for trajectory uncertainties. In this study, we propose
EquiDiff, a deep generative model for predicting future vehicle trajectories.
EquiDiff is based on the conditional diffusion model, which generates future
trajectories by incorporating historical information and random Gaussian noise.
The backbone model of EquiDiff is an SO(2)-equivariant transformer that fully
utilizes the geometric properties of location coordinates. In addition, we
employ Recurrent Neural Networks and Graph Attention Networks to extract social
interactions from historical trajectories. To evaluate the performance of
EquiDiff, we conduct extensive experiments on the NGSIM dataset. Our results
demonstrate that EquiDiff outperforms other baseline models in short-term
prediction, but has slightly higher errors for long-term prediction.
Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to investigate the contribution of
each component of EquiDiff to the prediction accuracy. Additionally, we present
a visualization of the generation process of our diffusion model, providing
insights into the uncertainty of the prediction.

<p class="mathjax">The core premise of permissionless blockchains is their reliable and secure
operation without the need to trust any individual agent. At the heart of
blockchain consensus mechanisms is an explicit cost (whether work or stake) for
participation in the network and the opportunity to add blocks to the
blockchain. A key rationale for that cost is to make attacks on the network,
which could be theoretically carried out if a majority of nodes were controlled
by a single entity, too expensive to be worthwhile. We demonstrate that a
majority attacker can successfully attack with a {\em negative cost}, which
shows that the protocol mechanisms are insufficient to create a secure network,
and emphasizes the importance of socially driven mechanisms external to the
protocol. At the same time, negative cost enables a new type of majority attack
that is more likely to elude external scrutiny.

evolves from a text-to-image synthesis model (i.e., Stable Diffusion).
ModelScopeT2V incorporates spatio-temporal blocks to ensure consistent frame
generation and smooth movement transitions. The model could adapt to varying
frame numbers during training and inference, rendering it suitable for both
image-text and video-text datasets. ModelScopeT2V brings together three
components (i.e., VQGAN, a text encoder, and a denoising UNet), totally
comprising 1.7 billion parameters, in which 0.5 billion parameters are
dedicated to temporal capabilities. The model demonstrates superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods across three evaluation metrics. The code and an

information from 4D radar and cameras, making it an attractive solution for
achieving accurate and robust pose estimation. However, 4DRVO may exhibit
significant tracking errors owing to three main factors: 1) sparsity of 4D
radar point clouds; 2) inaccurate data association and insufficient feature
interaction between the 4D radar and camera; and 3) disturbances caused by
dynamic objects in the environment, affecting odometry estimation. In this
paper, we present 4DRVO-Net, which is a method for 4D radar--visual odometry.
This method leverages the feature pyramid, pose warping, and cost volume (PWC)
network architecture to progressively estimate and refine poses. Specifically,
we propose a multi-scale feature extraction network called Radar-PointNet++
that fully considers rich 4D radar point information, enabling fine-grained
learning for sparse 4D radar point clouds. To effectively integrate the two
modalities, we design an adaptive 4D radar--camera fusion module (A-RCFM) that
automatically selects image features based on 4D radar point features,
facilitating multi-scale cross-modal feature interaction and adaptive
multi-modal feature fusion. In addition, we introduce a velocity-guided
point-confidence estimation module to measure local motion patterns, reduce the
influence of dynamic objects and outliers, and provide continuous updates
during pose refinement. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our method
and the effectiveness of each module design on both the VoD and in-house
datasets. Our method outperforms all learning-based and geometry-based methods
for most sequences in the VoD dataset. Furthermore, it has exhibited promising
performance that closely approaches that of the 64-line LiDAR odometry results
of A-LOAM without mapping optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Tikhonov regularization is a widely used technique in solving inverse
problems that can enforce prior properties on the desired solution. In this
paper, we propose a Krylov subspace based iterative method for solving linear
inverse problems with general-form Tikhonov regularization term $x^TMx$, where
$M$ is a positive semi-definite matrix. An iterative process called the
preconditioned Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization (pGKB) is designed, which
implicitly utilizes a proper preconditioner to generate a series of solution
subspaces with desirable properties encoded by the regularizer $x^TMx$. Based
on the pGKB process, we propose an iterative regularization algorithm via
projecting the original problem onto small dimensional solution subspaces. We
analyze regularization effect of this algorithm, including the incorporation of
prior properties of the desired solution into the solution subspace and the
semi-convergence behavior of regularized solution. To overcome instabilities
caused by semi-convergence, we further propose two pGKB based hybrid
regularization algorithms. All the proposed algorithms are tested on both
small-scale and large-scale linear inverse problems. Numerical results
demonstrate that these iterative algorithms exhibit excellent performance,
outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms in some cases.

<p class="mathjax">Multiscale finite volume methods are known to produce reduced systems with
multipoint stencils which, in turn, could give non-monotone and out-of-bound
solutions. We propose a novel solution to the monotonicity issue of multiscale
methods. The proposed algorithmic monotone (AM- MsFV/MsRSB) framework is based
on an algebraic modification to the original MsFV/MsRSB coarse-scale stencil.
The AM-MsFV/MsRSB guarantees monotonic and within bound solutions without
compromising accuracy for various coarsening ratios; hence, it effectively
addresses the challenge of multiscale methods' sensitivity to coarse grid
partitioning choices. Moreover, by preserving the near null space of the
original operator, the AM-MsRSB showed promising performance when integrated in
iterative formulations using both the control volume and the Galerkin-type
restriction operators. We also propose a new approach to enhance the
performance of MsRSB for MPFA discretized systems, particularly targeting the
construction of the prolongation operator. Results show the potential of our
approach in terms of accuracy of the computed basis functions and the overall
convergence behavior of the multiscale solver while ensuring a monotone
solution at all times.

<p class="mathjax">Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) divide a given problem in to a
number of subproblems and use an evolutionary algorithm to solve each
subproblem. This short paper is concerned with the scenario under which only a
single, global fitness measure exists. By removing the typically used
subproblem partnering mechanism, it is suggested that such CCEAs can be viewed
as making use of a generalised version of the global crossover operator
introduced in early Evolution Strategies. Using the well-known NK model of
fitness landscapes, the effects of varying aspects of global crossover with
respect to the ruggedness of the underlying fitness landscape are explored.
Results suggest improvements over the most widely used form of CCEAs, something
further demonstrated using other well-known test functions.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as an energy-efficient
alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their
unique spike-based event-driven nature. Coding is crucial in SNNs as it
converts external input stimuli into spatio-temporal feature sequences.
However, most existing deep SNNs rely on direct coding that generates powerless
spike representation and lacks the temporal dynamics inherent in human vision.
Hence, we introduce Gated Attention Coding (GAC), a plug-and-play module that
leverages the multi-dimensional gated attention unit to efficiently encode
inputs into powerful representations before feeding them into the SNN
architecture. GAC functions as a preprocessing layer that does not disrupt the
spike-driven nature of the SNN, making it amenable to efficient neuromorphic
hardware implementation with minimal modifications. Through an observer model
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate GAC's attention mechanism improves
temporal dynamics and coding efficiency. Experiments on CIFAR10/100 and
ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GAC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with
remarkable efficiency. Notably, we improve top-1 accuracy by 3.10\% on CIFAR100
with only 6-time steps and 1.07\% on ImageNet while reducing energy usage to
66.9\% of the previous works. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to
explore the attention-based dynamic coding scheme in deep SNNs, with
exceptional effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.

knowledge and bias in what is the input to the KG. Additionally, world
knowledge constantly expands and evolves, making existing facts deprecated or
introducing new ones. However, we would still want to be able to answer queries
as if the graph were complete. In this chapter, we will give an overview of
several methods which have been proposed to answer queries in such a setting.
We will first provide an overview of the different query types which can be
supported by these methods and datasets typically used for evaluation, as well
as an insight into their limitations. Then, we give an overview of the
different approaches and describe them in terms of expressiveness, supported

<p class="mathjax">Code generation tools driven by artificial intelligence have recently become
more popular due to advancements in deep learning and natural language
processing that have increased their capabilities. The proliferation of these
tools may be a double-edged sword because while they can increase developer
productivity by making it easier to write code, research has shown that they
can also generate insecure code. In this paper, we perform a user-centered
evaluation GitHub's Copilot to better understand its strengths and weaknesses
with respect to code security. We conduct a user study where participants solve
programming problems, which have potentially vulnerable solutions, with and
without Copilot assistance. The main goal of the user study is to determine how
the use of Copilot affects participants' security performance. In our set of
participants (n=25), we find that access to Copilot accompanies a more secure
solution when tackling harder problems. For the easier problem, we observe no
effect of Copilot access on the security of solutions. We also observe no
disproportionate impact of Copilot use on particular kinds of vulnerabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Quantifying uncertainty about a policy's long-term performance is important
to solve sequential decision-making tasks. We study the problem from a
model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning perspective, where the goal is to
learn the posterior distribution over value functions induced by parameter
(epistemic) uncertainty of the Markov decision process. Previous work restricts
the analysis to a few moments of the distribution over values or imposes a
particular distribution shape, e.g., Gaussians. Inspired by distributional
reinforcement learning, we introduce a Bellman operator whose fixed-point is
the value distribution function. Based on our theory, we propose Epistemic
Quantile-Regression (EQR), a model-based algorithm that learns a value
distribution function that can be used for policy optimization. Evaluation
across several continuous-control tasks shows performance benefits with respect
to established model-based and model-free algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous navigation in offroad environments has been extensively studied in
the robotics field. However, navigation in covert situations where an
autonomous vehicle needs to remain hidden from outside observers remains an
underexplored area. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) based algorithm, called CoverNav, for identifying covert and
navigable trajectories with minimal cost in offroad terrains and jungle
environments in the presence of observers. CoverNav focuses on unmanned ground
vehicles seeking shelters and taking covers while safely navigating to a
predefined destination. Our proposed DRL method computes a local cost map that
helps distinguish which path will grant the maximal covertness while
maintaining a low cost trajectory using an elevation map generated from 3D
point cloud data, the robot's pose, and directed goal information. CoverNav
helps robot agents to learn the low elevation terrain using a reward function
while penalizing it proportionately when it experiences high elevation. If an
observer is spotted, CoverNav enables the robot to select natural obstacles
(e.g., rocks, houses, disabled vehicles, trees, etc.) and use them as shelters
to hide behind. We evaluate CoverNav using the Unity simulation environment and
show that it guarantees dynamically feasible velocities in the terrain when fed
with an elevation map generated by another DRL based navigation algorithm.
Additionally, we evaluate CoverNav's effectiveness in achieving a maximum goal
distance of 12 meters and its success rate in different elevation scenarios
with and without cover objects. We observe competitive performance comparable
to state of the art (SOTA) methods without compromising accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce VisIT-Bench (Visual InsTruction Benchmark), a benchmark for
evaluation of instruction-following vision-language models for real-world use.
Our starting point is curating 70 'instruction families' that we envision
instruction tuned vision-language models should be able to address. Extending
beyond evaluations like VQAv2 and COCO, tasks range from basic recognition to
game playing and creative generation. Following curation, our dataset comprises
592 test queries, each with a human-authored instruction-conditioned caption.
These descriptions surface instruction-specific factors, e.g., for an
instruction asking about the accessibility of a storefront for wheelchair
users, the instruction-conditioned caption describes ramps/potential obstacles.
These descriptions enable 1) collecting human-verified reference outputs for
each instance; and 2) automatic evaluation of candidate multimodal generations
using a text-only LLM, aligning with human judgment. We quantify quality gaps
between models and references using both human and automatic evaluations; e.g.,
the top-performing instruction-following model wins against the GPT-4 reference
in just 27% of the comparison. VisIT-Bench is dynamic to participate,
practitioners simply submit their model's response on the project website;
Data, code and leaderboard is available at visit-bench.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">The translation of thermal infrared (TIR) images to visible light (VI) images
presents a challenging task with potential applications spanning various
domains such as TIR-VI image registration and fusion. Leveraging supplementary
information derived from TIR image conversions can significantly enhance model
performance and generalization across these applications. However, prevailing
issues within this field include suboptimal image fidelity and limited model
scalability. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm, LadleNet, based on the
U-Net architecture. LadleNet employs a two-stage U-Net concatenation structure,
augmented with skip connections and refined feature aggregation techniques,
resulting in a substantial enhancement in model performance. Comprising
'Handle' and 'Bowl' modules, LadleNet's Handle module facilitates the
construction of an abstract semantic space, while the Bowl module decodes this
semantic space to yield mapped VI images. The Handle module exhibits
extensibility by allowing the substitution of its network architecture with
semantic segmentation networks, thereby establishing more abstract semantic
spaces to bolster model performance. Consequently, we propose LadleNet+, which
replaces LadleNet's Handle module with the pre-trained DeepLabv3+ network,
thereby endowing the model with enhanced semantic space construction
capabilities. The proposed method is evaluated and tested on the KAIST dataset,
accompanied by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Compared to existing
methodologies, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of
image clarity and perceptual quality. The source code will be made available at
https://github.com/Ach-1914/LadleNet/tree/main/.

<p class="mathjax">A state-of-the-art large eddy simulation code has been developed to solve
compressible flows in turbomachinery. The code has been engineered with a high
degree of scalability, enabling it to effectively leverage the many-core
architecture of the new Sunway system. A consistent performance of 115.8
DP-PFLOPs has been achieved on a high-pressure turbine cascade consisting of
over 1.69 billion mesh elements and 865 billion Degree of Freedoms (DOFs). By
leveraging a high-order unstructured solver and its portability to large
heterogeneous parallel systems, we have progressed towards solving the grand

<p class="mathjax">Medical systematic reviews can be very costly and resource intensive. We
explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can support and be trained to perform
literature screening when provided with a detailed set of selection criteria.
Specifically, we instruction tune LLaMA and Guanaco models to perform abstract
screening for medical systematic reviews. Our best model, Bio-SIEVE,
outperforms both ChatGPT and trained traditional approaches, and generalises
better across medical domains. However, there remains the challenge of adapting
the model to safety-first scenarios. We also explore the impact of multi-task
training with Bio-SIEVE-Multi, including tasks such as PICO extraction and
exclusion reasoning, but find that it is unable to match single-task
Bio-SIEVE's performance. We see Bio-SIEVE as an important step towards
specialising LLMs for the biomedical systematic review process and explore its
future developmental opportunities. We release our models, code and a list of
DOIs to reconstruct our dataset for reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">It is common practice to apply padding prior to convolution operations to
preserve the resolution of feature-maps in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
While many alternatives exist, this is often achieved by adding a border of
zeros around the inputs. In this work, we show that adversarial attacks often
result in perturbation anomalies at the image boundaries, which are the areas
where padding is used. Consequently, we aim to provide an analysis of the
interplay between padding and adversarial attacks and seek an answer to the
question of how different padding modes (or their absence) affect adversarial
robustness in various scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Smart agriculture is one of the most promising areas where IoT-enabled
technologies have the potential to substantially improve the quality and
quantity of the crops and reduce the associated operational cost. However,
building a smart agriculture system presents several challenges, including high
latency and bandwidth consumption associated with cloud computing, frequent
Internet disconnections in rural areas, and the need to keep costs low for
farmers. This paper presents an end-to-end, fog-based smart agriculture
infrastructure that incorporates edge computing and LoRa-based communication to
address these challenges. Our system is deployed to transform traditional
agriculture land of rural areas into smart agriculture. We address the top
concern of farmers - animals intruding - by proposing a solution that detects
animal intrusion using low-cost PIR sensors, cameras, and computer vision. In
particular, we propose three different sensor layouts and a novel algorithm for
predicting animals' future locations. Our system can detect animals before they
intrude into the field, identify them, predict their future locations, and
alert farmers in a timely manner. Our experiments show that the system can
effectively and quickly detect animal intrusions while maintaining a much lower
cost than current state-of-the-art systems.

<p class="mathjax">To refactor already working code while keeping reliability, compatibility and
perhaps security, we can borrow ideas from micropass/nanopass compilers. By
treating the procedure of software refactoring as composing code
transformations, and compressing repetitive transformations with automation
tools, we can often obtain representations of refactoring processes short
enough that their correctness can be analysed manually. Unlike in compilers, in
refactoring we usually only need to consider the codebase in question, so
regular text processing can be extensively used, fully exploiting patterns only
present in the codebase. Aside from the direct application of code
transformations from compilers, many other kinds of equivalence properties may
also be exploited. In this paper, two refactoring projects are given as the
main examples, where 10-100 times simplification has been achieved with the
application of a few kinds of useful transformations.

<p class="mathjax">Pruning is a widely used technique for reducing the size of deep neural
networks while maintaining their performance. However, such a technique,
despite being able to massively compress deep models, is hardly able to remove
entire layers from a model (even when structured): is this an addressable task?
In this study, we introduce EGP, an innovative Entropy Guided Pruning algorithm
aimed at reducing the size of deep neural networks while preserving their
performance. The key focus of EGP is to prioritize pruning connections in
layers with low entropy, ultimately leading to their complete removal. Through
extensive experiments conducted on popular models like ResNet-18 and Swin-T,
our findings demonstrate that EGP effectively compresses deep neural networks
while maintaining competitive performance levels. Our results not only shed
light on the underlying mechanism behind the advantages of unstructured
pruning, but also pave the way for further investigations into the intricate
relationship between entropy, pruning techniques, and deep learning
performance. The EGP algorithm and its insights hold great promise for
advancing the field of network compression and optimization. The source code
for EGP is released open-source.

<p class="mathjax">In the third round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization
project, the focus is on optimizing software and hardware implementations of
candidate schemes. The winning schemes are CRYSTALS Kyber and CRYSTALS
Dilithium, which serve as a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital
Signature Algorithm (DSA), respectively. This study utilizes the TaPaSCo
open-source framework to create hardware building blocks for both schemes using
High-level Synthesis (HLS) from minimally modified ANSI C software reference
implementations across all security levels. Additionally, a generic TaPaSCo
host runtime application is developed in Rust to verify their functionality
through the standard NIST interface, utilizing the corresponding Known Answer
Test mechanism on actual hardware. Building on this foundation, the
communication overhead for TaPaSCo hardware accelerators on PCIe-connected FPGA
devices is evaluated and compared with previous work and optimized AVX2
software reference implementations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of
verifying and evaluating the performance of Post-Quantum Cryptography
accelerators on real hardware using TaPaSCo. Furthermore, the off-chip
accelerator communication overhead of the NIST standard interface is measured,
which, on its own, outweighs the execution wall clock time of the optimized
software reference implementation of Kyber at Security Level 1.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks are prone to learn easy solutions from superficial statistics
in the data, namely shortcut learning, which impairs generalization and
robustness of models. We propose a data augmentation strategy, named DFM-X,
that leverages knowledge about frequency shortcuts, encoded in Dominant
Frequencies Maps computed for image classification models. We randomly select
X% training images of certain classes for augmentation, and process them by
retaining the frequencies included in the DFMs of other classes. This strategy
compels the models to leverage a broader range of frequencies for
classification, rather than relying on specific frequency sets. Thus, the
models learn more deep and task-related semantics compared to their counterpart
trained with standard setups. Unlike other commonly used augmentation
techniques which focus on increasing the visual variations of training data,
our method targets exploiting the original data efficiently, by distilling
prior knowledge about destructive learning behavior of models from data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that DFM-X improves robustness against common
corruptions and adversarial attacks. It can be seamlessly integrated with other
augmentation techniques to further enhance the robustness of models.

<p class="mathjax">The common assumption that train and test sets follow similar distributions
is often violated in deployment settings. Given multiple source domains, domain
generalization aims to create robust models capable of generalizing to new
unseen domains. To this end, most of existing studies focus on extracting
domain invariant features across the available source domains in order to
mitigate the effects of inter-domain distributional changes. However, this
approach may limit the model's generalization capacity by relying solely on
finding common features among the source domains. It overlooks the potential
presence of domain-specific characteristics that could be prevalent in a subset
of domains, potentially containing valuable information. In this work, a novel
architecture named Additive Disentanglement of Domain Features with Remix Loss
(ADRMX) is presented, which addresses this limitation by incorporating domain
variant features together with the domain invariant ones using an original
additive disentanglement strategy. Moreover, a new data augmentation technique
is introduced to further support the generalization capacity of ADRMX, where
samples from different domains are mixed within the latent space. Through
extensive experiments conducted on DomainBed under fair conditions, ADRMX is
shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made available at
GitHub after the revision process.

<p class="mathjax">To ensure the safe and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles and
advanced driving assistance systems in complex traffic scenarios, predicting
the future bounding boxes of surrounding traffic agents is crucial. However,
simultaneously predicting the future location and scale of target traffic
agents from the egocentric view poses challenges due to the vehicle's egomotion
causing considerable field-of-view changes. Moreover, in anomalous or risky
situations, tracking loss or abrupt motion changes limit the available
observation time, requiring learning of cues within a short time window.
Existing methods typically use a simple concatenation operation to combine
different cues, overlooking their dynamics over time. To address this, this
paper introduces the Fusion-Gated Recurrent Unit (Fusion-GRU) network, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture for future bounding box localization. Unlike
traditional GRUs, Fusion-GRU accounts for mutual and complex interactions among
input features. Moreover, an intermediary estimator coupled with a
self-attention aggregation layer is also introduced to learn sequential
dependencies for long range prediction. Finally, a GRU decoder is employed to
predict the future bounding boxes. The proposed method is evaluated on two
publicly available datasets, ROL and HEV-I. The experimental results showcase
the promising performance of the Fusion-GRU, demonstrating its effectiveness in
predicting future bounding boxes of traffic agents.

<p class="mathjax">Tracking 3D objects accurately and consistently is crucial for autonomous
vehicles, enabling more reliable downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction
and motion planning. Based on the substantial progress in object detection in
recent years, the tracking-by-detection paradigm has become a popular choice
due to its simplicity and efficiency. State-of-the-art 3D multi-object tracking
(MOT) approaches typically rely on non-learned model-based algorithms such as
Kalman Filter but require many manually tuned parameters. On the other hand,
learning-based approaches face the problem of adapting the training to the
online setting, leading to inevitable distribution mismatch between training
and inference as well as suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose
3DMOTFormer, a learned geometry-based 3D MOT framework building upon the
transformer architecture. We use an Edge-Augmented Graph Transformer to reason
on the track-detection bipartite graph frame-by-frame and conduct data
association via edge classification. To reduce the distribution mismatch
between training and inference, we propose a novel online training strategy
with an autoregressive and recurrent forward pass as well as sequential batch
optimization. Using CenterPoint detections, our approach achieves 71.2% and
68.2% AMOTA on the nuScenes validation and test split, respectively. In
addition, a trained 3DMOTFormer model generalizes well across different object
detectors. Code is available at: https://github.com/dsx0511/3DMOTFormer.

<p class="mathjax">We present a pipeline for printing interactive and always-on magnetophoretic
displays using affordable Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers. Using
our pipeline, an end-user can convert the surface of a 3D shape into a matrix
of voxels. The generated model can be sent to an FDM 3D printer equipped with
an additional syringe-based injector. During the printing process, an oil and
iron powder-based liquid mixture is injected into each voxel cell, allowing the
appearance of the once-printed object to be editable with external magnetic
sources. To achieve this, we made modifications to the 3D printer hardware and
the firmware. We also developed a 3D editor to prepare printable models. We
demonstrate our pipeline with a variety of examples, including a printed
Stanford bunny with customizable appearances, a small espresso mug that can be
used as a post-it note surface, a board game figurine with a computationally
updated display, and a collection of flexible wearable accessories with

<p class="mathjax">Graph-based diffusion models have shown promising results in terms of
generating high-quality solutions to NP-complete (NPC) combinatorial
optimization (CO) problems. However, those models are often inefficient in
inference, due to the iterative evaluation nature of the denoising diffusion
process. This paper proposes to use progressive distillation to speed up the
inference by taking fewer steps (e.g., forecasting two steps ahead within a
single step) during the denoising process. Our experimental results show that
the progressively distilled model can perform inference 16 times faster with
only 0.019% degradation in performance on the TSP-50 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider a task offloading problem in a multi-access edge
computing (MEC) network, in which edge users can either use their local
processing unit to compute their tasks or offload their tasks to a nearby edge
server through multiple communication channels each with different
characteristics. The main objective is to maximize the energy efficiency of the
edge users while meeting computing tasks deadlines. In the multi-user
multi-channel offloading scenario, users are distributed with partial
observations of the system states. We formulate this problem as a stochastic
optimization problem and leverage \emph{contextual neural multi-armed bandit}
models to develop an energy-efficient deadline-aware solution, dubbed E2DA. The
proposed E2DA framework only relies on partial state information (i.e.,
computation task features) to make offloading decisions. Through extensive
numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the E2DA algorithm can efficiently
learn an offloading policy and achieve close-to-optimal performance in
comparison with several baseline policies that optimize energy consumption
and/or response time. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive set of results on
the MEC system performance for various applications such as augmented reality
(AR) and virtual reality (VR).

<p class="mathjax">Predicting pedestrians' trajectories is a crucial capability for autonomous
vehicles' safe navigation, especially in spaces shared with pedestrians.
Pedestrian motion in shared spaces is influenced by both the presence of
vehicles and other pedestrians. Therefore, effectively modelling both
pedestrian-pedestrian and pedestrian-vehicle interactions can increase the
accuracy of the pedestrian trajectory prediction models. Despite the huge
literature on ways to encode the effect of interacting agents on a pedestrian's
predicted trajectory using deep-learning models, limited effort has been put
into the effective selection of interacting agents. In the majority of cases,
the interaction features used are mainly based on relative distances while
paying less attention to the effect of the velocity and approaching direction
in the interaction formulation. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-based
process of selecting the interacting agents based on collision risk
calculation. Focusing on interactions of potentially colliding agents with a
target pedestrian, we propose the use of time-to-collision and the approach
direction angle of two agents for encoding the interaction effect. This is done
by introducing a novel polar collision grid map. Our results have shown
predicted trajectories closer to the ground truth compared to existing methods
(used as a baseline) on the HBS dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Programming-by-example (PBE) systems aim to alleviate the burden of
programming. However, user-specified examples are often ambiguous, leaving
multiple programs to satisfy the specification. Consequently, in most prior
work, users have had to provide additional examples, particularly negative
ones, to further constrain the search over compatible programs. Recent work
resolves additional ambiguity by modeling program synthesis tasks as pragmatic
communication, showing promising results on a graphics domain using a
rudimentary user-study. We adapt pragmatic reasoning to a sub-domain of regular
expressions and rigorously study its usability as a means of communication both
with and without the ability to provide negative examples. Our user study
(N=30) demonstrates that, with a pragmatic synthesizer, end-users can more
successfully communicate a target regex using positive examples alone (95%)
compared to using a non-pragmatic synthesizer (51%). Further, users can
communicate more efficiently (57% fewer examples) with a pragmatic synthesizer
compared to a non-pragmatic one.

<p class="mathjax">WeChat, a widely-used messenger app boasting over 1 billion monthly active
users, requires effective app quality assurance for its complex features.
Record-and-replay tools are crucial in achieving this goal. Despite the
extensive development of these tools, the impact of waiting time between replay
events has been largely overlooked. On one hand, a long waiting time for
executing replay events on fully-rendered GUIs slows down the process. On the
other hand, a short waiting time can lead to events executing on
partially-rendered GUIs, negatively affecting replay effectiveness. An optimal
waiting time should strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency. We
introduce WeReplay, a lightweight image-based approach that dynamically adjusts
inter-event time based on the GUI rendering state. Given the real-time
streaming on the GUI, WeReplay employs a deep learning model to infer the
rendering state and synchronize with the replaying tool, scheduling the next
event when the GUI is fully rendered. Our evaluation shows that our model
achieves 92.1% precision and 93.3% recall in discerning GUI rendering states in
the WeChat app. Through assessing the performance in replaying 23 common WeChat
usage scenarios, WeReplay successfully replays all scenarios on the same and
different devices more efficiently than the state-of-the-practice baselines.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of active collaborative localization in
heterogeneous robot teams with unknown data association. It involves
positioning a small number of identical unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) at
desired positions so that an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can, through
unlabelled measurements of UGVs, uniquely determine its global pose. We model
the problem as a sequential two player game, in which the first player
positions the UGVs and the second identifies the two distinct hypothetical
poses of the UAV at which the sets of measurements to the UGVs differ by as
little as possible. We solve the underlying problem from the vantage point of
the first player for a subclass of measurement models using a mixture of local
optimization and exhaustive search procedures. Real-world experiments with a
team of UAV and UGVs show that our method can achieve centimeter-level global
localization accuracy. We also show that our method consistently outperforms
random positioning of UGVs by a large margin, with as much as a 90% reduction
in position and angular estimation error. Our method can tolerate a significant
amount of random as well as non-stochastic measurement noise. This indicates
its potential for reliable state estimation on board size, weight, and power
(SWaP) constrained UAVs. This work enables robust localization in
perceptually-challenged GPS-denied environments, thus paving the road for
large-scale multi-robot navigation and mapping.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection in time series data, to identify points that deviate from
normal behaviour, is a common problem in various domains such as manufacturing,
medical imaging, and cybersecurity. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) are shown to be effective in detecting anomalies in time series data.
The neural network architecture of GANs (i.e. Generator and Discriminator) can
significantly improve anomaly detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
new GAN model, named Adjusted-LSTM GAN (ALGAN), which adjusts the output of an
LSTM network for improved anomaly detection in both univariate and multivariate
time series data in an unsupervised setting. We evaluate the performance of
ALGAN on 46 real-world univariate time series datasets and a large multivariate
dataset that spans multiple domains. Our experiments demonstrate that ALGAN
outperforms traditional, neural network-based, and other GAN-based methods for
anomaly detection in time series data.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) has attracted a surge of interest over
the past decade but is difficult to be used in real-world applications.
Considering the privacy-preservation issues and security concerns, in this
work, we study a practical problem of Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA),
which eliminates the reliance on annotated source data. Current SFDA methods
focus on extracting domain knowledge from the source-trained model but neglects
the intrinsic structure of the target domain. Moreover, they typically utilize
pseudo labels for self-training in the target domain, but suffer from the
notorious error accumulation problem. To address these issues, we propose a new
SFDA framework, called Region-to-Pixel Adaptation Network~(RPANet), which
learns the region-level and pixel-level discriminative representations through
coarse-to-fine self-supervision. The proposed RPANet consists of two modules,
Foreground-aware Contrastive Learning (FCL) and Confidence-Calibrated
Pseudo-Labeling (CCPL), which explicitly address the key challenges of ``how to
distinguish'' and ``how to refine''. To be specific, FCL introduces a
supervised contrastive learning paradigm in the region level to contrast
different region centroids across different target images, which efficiently
involves all pseudo labels while robust to noisy samples. CCPL designs a novel
fusion strategy to reduce the overconfidence problem of pseudo labels by fusing
two different target predictions without introducing any additional network
modules. Extensive experiments on three cross-domain polyp segmentation tasks
reveal that RPANet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA and UDA
methods without access to source data, revealing the potential of SFDA in
medical applications.

<p class="mathjax">The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of ML and DL
methodologies in agricultural systems, showcased by great successes in variety
of agricultural applications. However, these conventional ML/DL models have
certain limitations: They heavily rely on large, costly-to-acquire labeled
datasets for training, require specialized expertise for development and
maintenance, and are mostly tailored for specific tasks, thus lacking
generalizability. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
successes in language and vision tasks across various domains. These models are
trained on a vast amount of data from multiple domains and modalities. Once
trained, they can accomplish versatile tasks with just minor fine-tuning and
minimal task-specific labeled data. Despite their proven effectiveness and huge
potential, there has been little exploration of applying FMs to agriculture
fields. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of FMs in the field
of smart agriculture. In particular, we present conceptual tools and technical
background to facilitate the understanding of the problem space and uncover new
research directions in this field. To this end, we first review recent FMs in
the general computer science domain and categorize them into four categories:
language FMs, vision FMs, multimodal FMs, and reinforcement learning FMs.
Subsequently, we outline the process of developing agriculture FMs and discuss
their potential applications in smart agriculture. We also discuss the unique
challenges associated with developing AFMs, including model training,
validation, and deployment. Through this study, we contribute to the
advancement of AI in agriculture by introducing AFMs as a promising paradigm
that can significantly mitigate the reliance on extensive labeled datasets and
enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of agricultural AI
systems.

<p class="mathjax">The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is the algorithm we use to
train neural networks. However, it remains poorly understood how the SGD
navigates the highly nonlinear and degenerate loss landscape of a neural
network. In this work, we prove that the minibatch noise of SGD regularizes the
solution towards a balanced solution whenever the loss function contains a
rescaling symmetry. Because the difference between a simple diffusion process
and SGD dynamics is the most significant when symmetries are present, our
theory implies that the loss function symmetries constitute an essential probe
of how SGD works. We then apply this result to derive the stationary
distribution of stochastic gradient flow for a diagonal linear network with
arbitrary depth and width. The stationary distribution exhibits complicated
nonlinear phenomena such as phase transitions, broken ergodicity, and
fluctuation inversion. These phenomena are shown to exist uniquely in deep
networks, implying a fundamental difference between deep and shallow models.

<p class="mathjax">Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) combine deep neural networks with the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), creating a new and promising
research area for numerically solving PDEs. Faced with a class of multi-scale
problems that include loss terms of different orders of magnitude in the loss
function, it is challenging for standard PINN methods to obtain an available
prediction. In this paper, we propose a new framework for solving multi-scale
problems by reconstructing the loss function. The framework is based on the
standard PINN method, and it modifies the loss function of the standard PINN
method by applying different numbers of power operations to the loss terms of
different magnitudes, so that the individual loss terms composing the loss
function have approximately the same order of magnitude among themselves. In
addition, we give a grouping regularization strategy, and this strategy can
deal well with the problem which varies significantly in different subdomains.
The proposed method enables loss terms with different magnitudes to be
optimized simultaneously, and it advances the application of PINN for
multi-scale problems.

<p class="mathjax">The Gaussian-radial-basis function neural network (GRBFNN) has been a popular
choice for interpolation and classification. However, it is computationally
intensive when the dimension of the input vector is high. To address this
issue, we propose a new feedforward network - Separable Gaussian Neural Network
(SGNN) by taking advantage of the separable property of Gaussian functions,
which splits input data into multiple columns and sequentially feeds them into
parallel layers formed by uni-variate Gaussian functions. This structure
reduces the number of neurons from O(N^d) of GRBFNN to O(dN), which
exponentially improves the computational speed of SGNN and makes it scale
linearly as the input dimension increases. In addition, SGNN can preserve the
dominant subspace of the Hessian matrix of GRBFNN in gradient descent training,
leading to a similar level of accuracy to GRBFNN. It is experimentally
demonstrated that SGNN can achieve 100 times speedup with a similar level of
accuracy over GRBFNN on tri-variate function approximations. The SGNN also has
better trainability and is more tuning-friendly than DNNs with RuLU and Sigmoid
functions. For approximating functions with complex geometry, SGNN can lead to
three orders of magnitude more accurate results than a RuLU-DNN with twice the
number of layers and the number of neurons per layer.

<p class="mathjax">Many organizations, including governments, utilities, and businesses, have
set ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions as a part of their
sustainability goals. To achieve these targets, these organizations
increasingly use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to obtain renewable energy
credits, which they use to offset their ``brown'' energy consumption. However,
the details of these PPAs are often private and not shared with important
stakeholders, such as grid operators and carbon information services, who
monitor and report the grid's carbon emissions. This often results in incorrect
carbon accounting where the same renewable energy production could be factored
into grid carbon emission reports and also separately claimed by organizations
that own PPAs. Such ``double counting'' of renewable energy production could
lead to organizations with PPAs to understate their carbon emissions and
overstate their progress towards their sustainability goals. Further, we show
that commonly-used carbon reduction measures, such as load shifting, can have
the opposite effect of increasing emissions if such measures were to use
inaccurate carbon intensity signals. For instance, users may increase energy
consumption because the grid's carbon intensity appears low even though carbon
intensity may actually be high when renewable energy attributed to PPAs are
excluded. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus on how to accurately
compute the grid's carbon intensity by properly accounting for PPAs. The goal
of our work is to shed quantitative light on the renewable energy attribution
problem and evaluate its impact of inaccurate accounting on carbon-aware
systems.

<p class="mathjax">The application of video captioning models aims at translating the content of
videos by using accurate natural language. Due to the complex nature inbetween
object interaction in the video, the comprehensive understanding of
spatio-temporal relations of objects remains a challenging task. Existing
methods often fail in generating sufficient feature representations of video
content. In this paper, we propose a video captioning model based on dual
graphs and gated fusion: we adapt two types of graphs to generate feature
representations of video content and utilize gated fusion to further understand
these different levels of information. Using a dual-graphs model to generate
appearance features and motion features respectively can utilize the content
correlation in frames to generate various features from multiple perspectives.
Among them, dual-graphs reasoning can enhance the content correlation in frame
sequences to generate advanced semantic features; The gated fusion, on the
other hand, aggregates the information in multiple feature representations for
comprehensive video content understanding. The experiments conducted on worldly
used datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed approach.

systematically debug errors that emerge in the machine learning pipeline. We
present MDB, a debugging framework for interactively querying datasets and
models. MDB integrates functional programming with relational algebra to build
expressive queries over a database of datasets and model predictions. Queries
are reusable and easily modified, enabling debuggers to rapidly iterate and
refine queries to discover and characterize errors and model behaviors. We
evaluate MDB on object detection, bias discovery, image classification, and
data imputation tasks across self-driving videos, large language models, and
medical records. Our experiments show that MDB enables up to 10x faster and
40\% shorter queries than other baselines. In a user study, we find developers
can successfully construct complex queries that describe errors of machine
learning models.

idea is to consider an arbitrary partition of the set $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ with
two subsets corresponding to two given roots of unity for which two truncated
sequences of new alphabet size determined by the two roots of unity are
obtained. We show that these two truncated sequences form a new $q$-ary CZCP

Furthermore, we derive an enumeration formula by considering the Stirling

<p class="mathjax">Binarization of neural networks is a dominant paradigm in neural networks
compression. The pioneering work BinaryConnect uses Straight Through Estimator
(STE) to mimic the gradients of the sign function, but it also causes the
crucial inconsistency problem. Most of the previous methods design different
estimators instead of STE to mitigate it. However, they ignore the fact that
when reducing the estimating error, the gradient stability will decrease
concomitantly. These highly divergent gradients will harm the model training
and increase the risk of gradient vanishing and gradient exploding. To fully
take the gradient stability into consideration, we present a new perspective to
the BNNs training, regarding it as the equilibrium between the estimating error
and the gradient stability. In this view, we firstly design two indicators to
quantitatively demonstrate the equilibrium phenomenon. In addition, in order to
balance the estimating error and the gradient stability well, we revise the
original straight through estimator and propose a power function based
estimator, Rectified Straight Through Estimator (ReSTE for short). Comparing to
other estimators, ReSTE is rational and capable of flexibly balancing the
estimating error with the gradient stability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet datasets show that ReSTE has excellent performance and surpasses
the state-of-the-art methods without any auxiliary modules or losses.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-Supervised image classification is one of the most fundamental problem
in computer vision, which significantly reduces the need for human labor. In
this paper, we introduce a new semi-supervised learning algorithm - SimMatchV2,
which formulates various consistency regularizations between labeled and
unlabeled data from the graph perspective. In SimMatchV2, we regard the
augmented view of a sample as a node, which consists of a label and its
corresponding representation. Different nodes are connected with the edges,
which are measured by the similarity of the node representations. Inspired by
the message passing and node classification in graph theory, we propose four
types of consistencies, namely 1) node-node consistency, 2) node-edge
consistency, 3) edge-edge consistency, and 4) edge-node consistency. We also
uncover that a simple feature normalization can reduce the gaps of the feature
norm between different augmented views, significantly improving the performance
of SimMatchV2. Our SimMatchV2 has been validated on multiple semi-supervised
learning benchmarks. Notably, with ResNet-50 as our backbone and 300 epochs of
training, SimMatchV2 achieves 71.9\% and 76.2\% Top-1 Accuracy with 1\% and
10\% labeled examples on ImageNet, which significantly outperforms the previous
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and pre-trained models

<p class="mathjax">Recent leading zero-shot video object segmentation (ZVOS) works devote to
integrating appearance and motion information by elaborately designing feature
fusion modules and identically applying them in multiple feature stages. Our
preliminary experiments show that with the strong long-range dependency
modeling capacity of Transformer, simply concatenating the two modality
features and feeding them to vanilla Transformers for feature fusion can
distinctly benefit the performance but at a cost of heavy computation. Through
further empirical analysis, we find that attention dependencies learned in
Transformer in different stages exhibit completely different properties: global
query-independent dependency in the low-level stages and semantic-specific
dependency in the high-level stages. Motivated by the observations, we propose
two Transformer variants: i) Context-Sharing Transformer (CST) that learns the
global-shared contextual information within image frames with a lightweight
computation. ii) Semantic Gathering-Scattering Transformer (SGST) that models
the semantic correlation separately for the foreground and background and
reduces the computation cost with a soft token merging mechanism. We apply CST
and SGST for low-level and high-level feature fusions, respectively,
formulating a level-isomerous Transformer framework for ZVOS task. Compared
with the baseline that uses vanilla Transformers for multi-stage fusion, ours
significantly increase the speed by 13 times and achieves new state-of-the-art
ZVOS performance. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-yyc/Isomer.

<p class="mathjax">Prior work has developed numerous systems that test the security and safety
of smart homes. For these systems to be applicable in practice, it is necessary
to test them with realistic scenarios that represent the use of the smart home,
i.e., home automation, in the wild. This demo paper presents the technical
details and usage of Helion, a system that uses n-gram language modeling to
learn the regularities in user-driven programs, i.e., routines developed for
the smart home, and predicts natural scenarios of home automation, i.e., event
sequences that reflect realistic home automation usage. We demonstrate the
HelionHA platform, developed by integrating Helion with the popular Home
Assistant smart home platform. HelionHA allows an end-to-end exploration of
Helion's scenarios by executing them as test cases with real and virtual smart
home devices.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have seen significant advancements in multi-modal knowledge
graph completion (MMKGC). MMKGC enhances knowledge graph completion (KGC) by
integrating multi-modal entity information, thereby facilitating the discovery
of unobserved triples in the large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs). Nevertheless,
existing methods emphasize the design of elegant KGC models to facilitate
modality interaction, neglecting the real-life problem of missing modalities in
KGs. The missing modality information impedes modal interaction, consequently
undermining the model's performance. In this paper, we propose a modality
adversarial and contrastive framework (MACO) to solve the modality-missing
problem in MMKGC. MACO trains a generator and discriminator adversarially to
generate missing modality features that can be incorporated into the MMKGC
model. Meanwhile, we design a cross-modal contrastive loss to improve the
performance of the generator. Experiments on public benchmarks with further
explorations demonstrate that MACO could achieve state-of-the-art results and
serve as a versatile framework to bolster various MMKGC models. Our code and
benchmark data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/MACO.

<p class="mathjax">Rendering high-resolution images in real-time applications (e.g., video
games, virtual reality) is time-consuming, thus super-resolution technology
becomes more and more crucial in real-time rendering. However, it is still
challenging to preserve sharp texture details, keep the temporal stability and
avoid the ghosting artifacts in the real-time rendering super-resolution. To
this end, we introduce radiance demodulation into real-time rendering
super-resolution, separating the rendered image or radiance into a lighting
component and a material component, due to the fact that the light component
tends to be smoother than the rendered image and the high-resolution material
component with detailed textures can be easily obtained. Therefore, we perform
the super-resolution only on the lighting component and re-modulate with the
high-resolution material component to obtain the final super-resolution image.
In this way, the texture details can be preserved much better. Then, we propose
a reliable warping module by explicitly pointing out the unreliable occluded
regions with a motion mask to remove the ghosting artifacts. We further enhance
the temporal stability by designing a frame-recurrent neural network to
aggregate the previous and current frames, which better captures the
spatial-temporal correlation between reconstructed frames. As a result, our
method is able to produce temporally stable results in real-time rendering with
high-quality details, even in the highly challenging 4 $\times$ 4
super-resolution scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Camouflaged objects that blend into natural scenes pose significant
challenges for deep-learning models to detect and synthesize. While camouflaged
object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with diverse real-world
applications, this research topic has been constrained by limited data
availability. We propose a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to
enhance the detection of camouflaged objects in natural scenes. Our approach
employs a generative model to produce realistic camouflage images, which can be
used to train existing object detection models. Specifically, we use a
camouflage environment generator supervised by a camouflage distribution
classifier to synthesize the camouflage images, which are then fed into our
generator to expand the dataset. Our framework outperforms the current
state-of-the-art method on three datasets (COD10k, CAMO, and CHAMELEON),
demonstrating its effectiveness in improving camouflaged object detection. This
approach can serve as a plug-and-play data generation and augmentation module
for existing camouflaged object detection tasks and provides a novel way to
introduce more diversity and distributions into current camouflage datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam
and RMSProp, have been widely used in training deep neural networks. We
empirically show that while the difference between the standard generalization
performance of models trained using these methods is small, those trained using
SGD exhibit far greater robustness under input perturbations. Notably, our
investigation demonstrates the presence of irrelevant frequencies in natural
datasets, where alterations do not affect models' generalization performance.
However, models trained with adaptive methods show sensitivity to these
changes, suggesting that their use of irrelevant frequencies can lead to
solutions sensitive to perturbations. To better understand this difference, we
study the learning dynamics of gradient descent (GD) and sign gradient descent
(signGD) on a synthetic dataset that mirrors natural signals. With a
three-dimensional input space, the models optimized with GD and signGD have
standard risks close to zero but vary in their adversarial risks. Our result
shows that linear models' robustness to $\ell_2$-norm bounded changes is
inversely proportional to the model parameters' weight norm: a smaller weight
norm implies better robustness. In the context of deep learning, our
experiments show that SGD-trained neural networks show smaller Lipschitz
constants, explaining the better robustness to input perturbations than those
trained with adaptive gradient methods.

<p class="mathjax">Graph convolutional networks have been widely applied in skeleton-based gait
recognition. A key challenge in this task is to distinguish the individual
walking styles of different subjects across various views. Existing
state-of-the-art methods employ uniform convolutions to extract features from
diverse sequences and ignore the effects of viewpoint changes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a condition-adaptive graph (CAG) convolution
network that can dynamically adapt to the specific attributes of each skeleton
sequence and the corresponding view angle. In contrast to using fixed weights
for all joints and sequences, we introduce a joint-specific filter learning
(JSFL) module in the CAG method, which produces sequence-adaptive filters at
the joint level. The adaptive filters capture fine-grained patterns that are
unique to each joint, enabling the extraction of diverse spatial-temporal
information about body parts. Additionally, we design a view-adaptive topology
learning (VATL) module that generates adaptive graph topologies. These graph
topologies are used to correlate the joints adaptively according to the
specific view conditions. Thus, CAG can simultaneously adjust to various
walking styles and viewpoints. Experiments on the two most widely used datasets
(i.e., CASIA-B and OU-MVLP) show that CAG surpasses all previous skeleton-based
methods. Moreover, the recognition performance can be enhanced by simply
combining CAG with appearance-based methods, demonstrating the ability of CAG
to provide useful complementary information.The source code will be available
at https://github.com/OliverHxh/CAG.

<p class="mathjax">Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to detect all the visual relation triplets
&lt;sub, pred, obj&gt; in a given image. With the emergence of various advanced
techniques for better utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic information in
each relation triplet, SGG has achieved great progress over the recent years.
However, due to the ubiquitous long-tailed predicate distributions, today's SGG
models are still easily biased to the head predicates. Currently, the most
prevalent debiasing solutions for SGG are re-balancing methods, e.g., changing
the distributions of original training samples. In this paper, we argue that
all existing re-balancing strategies fail to increase the diversity of the
relation triplet features of each predicate, which is critical for robust SGG.
To this end, we propose a novel Compositional Feature Augmentation (CFA)
strategy, which is the first unbiased SGG work to mitigate the bias issue from
the perspective of increasing the diversity of triplet features. Specifically,
we first decompose each relation triplet feature into two components: intrinsic
feature and extrinsic feature, which correspond to the intrinsic
characteristics and extrinsic contexts of a relation triplet, respectively.
Then, we design two different feature augmentation modules to enrich the
feature diversity of original relation triplets by replacing or mixing up
either their intrinsic or extrinsic features from other samples. Due to its
model-agnostic nature, CFA can be seamlessly incorporated into various SGG
frameworks. Extensive ablations have shown that CFA achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance on the trade-off between different metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Thanks to the rapid development of diffusion models, unprecedented progress
has been witnessed in image synthesis. Prior works mostly rely on pre-trained
linguistic models, but a text is often too abstract to properly specify all the
spatial properties of an image, e.g., the layout configuration of a scene,
leading to the sub-optimal results of complex scene generation. In this paper,
we achieve accurate complex scene generation by proposing a semantically
controllable Layout-AWare diffusion model, termed LAW-Diffusion. Distinct from
the previous Layout-to-Image generation (L2I) methods that only explore
category-aware relationships, LAW-Diffusion introduces a spatial dependency
parser to encode the location-aware semantic coherence across objects as a
layout embedding and produces a scene with perceptually harmonious object
styles and contextual relations. To be specific, we delicately instantiate each
object's regional semantics as an object region map and leverage a
location-aware cross-object attention module to capture the spatial
dependencies among those disentangled representations. We further propose an
adaptive guidance schedule for our layout guidance to mitigate the trade-off
between the regional semantic alignment and the texture fidelity of generated
objects. Moreover, LAW-Diffusion allows for instance reconfiguration while
maintaining the other regions in a synthesized image by introducing a
layout-aware latent grafting mechanism to recompose its local regional
semantics. To better verify the plausibility of generated scenes, we propose a
new evaluation metric for the L2I task, dubbed Scene Relation Score (SRS) to
measure how the images preserve the rational and harmonious relations among
contextual objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our
LAW-Diffusion yields the state-of-the-art generative performance, especially
with coherent object relations.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are state-of-the-art models for performing
prediction tasks on graphs. While existing GNNs have shown great performance on
various tasks related to graphs, little attention has been paid to the scenario
where out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes exist in the graph during training and
inference. Borrowing the concept from CV and NLP, we define OOD nodes as nodes
with labels unseen from the training set. Since a lot of networks are
automatically constructed by programs, real-world graphs are often noisy and
may contain nodes from unknown distributions. In this work, we define the
problem of graph learning with out-of-distribution nodes. Specifically, we aim
to accomplish two tasks: 1) detect nodes which do not belong to the known
distribution and 2) classify the remaining nodes to be one of the known
classes. We demonstrate that the connection patterns in graphs are informative
for outlier detection, and propose Out-of-Distribution Graph Attention Network
(OODGAT), a novel GNN model which explicitly models the interaction between
different kinds of nodes and separate inliers from outliers during feature
propagation. Extensive experiments show that OODGAT outperforms existing
outlier detection methods by a large margin, while being better or comparable

<p class="mathjax">Vision-based stair perception can help autonomous mobile robots deal with the
challenge of climbing stairs, especially in unfamiliar environments. To address
the problem that current monocular vision methods are difficult to model stairs
accurately without depth information, this paper proposes a depth-aware stair
modeling method for monocular vision. Specifically, we take the extraction of
stair geometric features and the prediction of depth images as joint tasks in a
convolutional neural network (CNN), with the designed information propagation
architecture, we can achieve effective supervision for stair geometric feature
learning by depth information. In addition, to complete the stair modeling, we
take the convex lines, concave lines, tread surfaces and riser surfaces as
stair geometric features and apply Gaussian kernels to enable the network to
predict contextual information within the stair lines. Combined with the depth
information obtained by depth sensors, we propose a stair point cloud
reconstruction method that can quickly get point clouds belonging to the stair
step surfaces. Experiments on our dataset show that our method has a
significant improvement over the previous best monocular vision method, with an
intersection over union (IOU) increase of 3.4 %, and the lightweight version
has a fast detection speed and can meet the requirements of most real-time
applications. Our dataset is available at

<p class="mathjax">In practice, incentive providers (i.e., principals) often cannot observe the
reward realizations of incentivized agents, which is in contrast to many
principal-agent models that have been previously studied. This information
asymmetry challenges the principal to consistently estimate the agent's unknown
rewards by solely watching the agent's decisions, which becomes even more
challenging when the agent has to learn its own rewards. This complex setting
is observed in various real-life scenarios ranging from renewable energy
storage contracts to personalized healthcare incentives. Hence, it offers not
only interesting theoretical questions but also wide practical relevance. This
paper explores a repeated adverse selection game between a self-interested
learning agent and a learning principal. The agent tackles a multi-armed bandit
(MAB) problem to maximize their expected reward plus incentive. On top of the
agent's learning, the principal trains a parallel algorithm and faces a
trade-off between consistently estimating the agent's unknown rewards and
maximizing their own utility by offering adaptive incentives to lead the agent.
For a non-parametric model, we introduce an estimator whose only input is the
history of principal's incentives and agent's choices. We unite this estimator
with a proposed data-driven incentive policy within a MAB framework. Without
restricting the type of the agent's algorithm, we prove finite-sample
consistency of the estimator and a rigorous regret bound for the principal by
considering the sequential externality imposed by the agent. Lastly, our
theoretical results are reinforced by simulations justifying applicability of
our framework to green energy aggregator contracts.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the challenging task of learning causal structure in the
presence of latent variables, including locating latent variables and
determining their quantity, and identifying causal relationships among both
latent and observed variables. To address this, we propose a Generalized
Independent Noise (GIN) condition for linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models
that incorporate latent variables, which establishes the independence between a
linear combination of certain measured variables and some other measured
variables. Specifically, for two observed random vectors $\bf{Y}$ and $\bf{Z}$,
GIN holds if and only if $\omega^{\intercal}\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ are
independent, where $\omega$ is a non-zero parameter vector determined by the
cross-covariance between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$. We then give necessary
and sufficient graphical criteria of the GIN condition in linear non-Gaussian
acyclic causal models. Roughly speaking, GIN implies the existence of an
exogenous set $\mathcal{S}$ relative to the parent set of $\mathbf{Y}$ (w.r.t.
the causal ordering), such that $\mathcal{S}$ d-separates $\mathbf{Y}$ from
$\mathbf{Z}$. Interestingly, we find that the independent noise condition
(i.e., if there is no confounder, causes are independent of the residual
derived from regressing the effect on the causes) can be seen as a special case
of GIN. With such a connection between GIN and latent causal structures, we
further leverage the proposed GIN condition, together with a well-designed
search procedure, to efficiently estimate Linear, Non-Gaussian Latent
Hierarchical Models (LiNGLaHs), where latent confounders may also be causally
related and may even follow a hierarchical structure. We show that the
underlying causal structure of a LiNGLaH is identifiable in light of GIN
conditions under mild assumptions. Experimental results show the effectiveness
of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">3D scene graph prediction is a task that aims to concurrently predict object
classes and their relationships within a 3D environment. As these environments
are primarily designed by and for humans, incorporating commonsense knowledge
regarding objects and their relationships can significantly constrain and
enhance the prediction of the scene graph. In this paper, we investigate the
application of commonsense knowledge graphs for 3D scene graph prediction on
point clouds of indoor scenes. Through experiments conducted on a real-world
indoor dataset, we demonstrate that integrating external commonsense knowledge
via the message-passing method leads to a 15.0 % improvement in scene graph
prediction accuracy with external knowledge and $7.96\%$ with internal
knowledge when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. We also tested in the
real world with 10 frames per second for scene graph generation to show the
usage of the model in a more realistic robotics setting.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies a novel movable antenna (MA)-enhanced multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system to leverage the corresponding spatial degrees of
freedom (DoFs) for improving the performance of wireless communications. We aim
to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the MA positions and the
transmit covariance matrix based on statistical channel state information
(CSI). To solve the resulting design problem, we develop a constrained
stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm applicable for the
general movement mode. Furthermore, we propose two simplified antenna movement
modes, namely the linear movement mode and the planar movement mode, to
facilitate efficient antenna movement and reduce the computational complexity
of the CSSCA algorithm. Numerical results show that the considered MA-enhanced
system can significantly improve the achievable rate compared to conventional
MIMO systems employing uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and that the proposed
planar movement mode performs closely to the performance upper bound achieved
by the general movement mode.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed the strong power of large text-to-image diffusion
models for the impressive generative capability to create high-fidelity images.
However, it is very tricky to generate desired images using only text prompt as
it often involves complex prompt engineering. An alternative to text prompt is
image prompt, as the saying goes: "an image is worth a thousand words".
Although existing methods of direct fine-tuning from pretrained models are
effective, they require large computing resources and are not compatible with
other base models, text prompt, and structural controls. In this paper, we
present IP-Adapter, an effective and lightweight adapter to achieve image
prompt capability for the pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. The key
design of our IP-Adapter is decoupled cross-attention mechanism that separates
cross-attention layers for text features and image features. Despite the
simplicity of our method, an IP-Adapter with only 22M parameters can achieve
comparable or even better performance to a fully fine-tuned image prompt model.
As we freeze the pretrained diffusion model, the proposed IP-Adapter can be
generalized not only to other custom models fine-tuned from the same base
model, but also to controllable generation using existing controllable tools.
With the benefit of the decoupled cross-attention strategy, the image prompt
can also work well with the text prompt to achieve multimodal image generation.

<p class="mathjax">Low light enhancement has gained increasing importance with the rapid
development of visual creation and editing. However, most existing enhancement
algorithms are designed to homogeneously increase the brightness of images to a
pre-defined extent, limiting the user experience. To address this issue, we
propose Controllable Light Enhancement Diffusion Model, dubbed CLE Diffusion, a
novel diffusion framework to provide users with rich controllability. Built
with a conditional diffusion model, we introduce an illumination embedding to
let users control their desired brightness level. Additionally, we incorporate
the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to enable user-friendly region
controllability, where users can click on objects to specify the regions they
wish to enhance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLE Diffusion achieves
competitive performance regarding quantitative metrics, qualitative results,
and versatile controllability. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the impact of memory orientation on the bias pattern
of SRAM-based PUFs. We designed and fabricated a 65nm CMOS chip that contains
eleven SRAM macros that exercise different memory- and chip-level parameters.
At the memory level, several parameters passed to the SRAM compiler are
considered, including the number of addresses, the number of words, the aspect
ratio, and the chosen bitcell. Chip-level decisions are considered during the
floorplan, including the location and rotation of each SRAM macro in the
testchip. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of different
memory orientations and their effect on the biasing direction. Physical
measurements performed on 50 fabricated chips revealed that specific memory
orientations, namely R270 and MY90, exhibit a distinct negative biasing
direction compared to other orientations. Importantly, this biasing direction
remains consistent regardless of memory type, column mux ratio, memory size, or
the utilization of SRAMs with different bitcells. Overall, this study
highlights the significance of careful physical implementation and memory
orientation selection in designing SRAM-based PUFs. Our findings can guide
designers in the selection of SRAM memories with properties that make for
better PUFs that potentially require less error correction effort to compensate
for instability.

<p class="mathjax">In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, high-capacity data transmission is
of utmost importance for applications such as intelligent transportation, smart
cities, and forest monitoring, which rely on the mobility of UAVs to collect
and transmit large amount of data, including video and image data. Due to the
short flight time of UAVs, the network capacity will be reduced when they
return to the ground unit for charging. Hence, we suggest that UAVs can apply a
store-carry-and-forward (SCF) transmission mode to carry packets on their way
back to the ground unit for improving network throughput. In this paper, we
propose a novel protocol, named UAV delay-tolerant multiple access control
(UD-MAC), which can support different transmission modes in UAV networks. We
set a higher priority for SCF transmission and analyze the probability of being
in SCF mode to derive network throughput. The simulation results show that the
network throughput of UD-MAC is improved by 57% to 83% compared to VeMAC.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years traditional numerical methods for accurate weather prediction
have been increasingly challenged by deep learning methods. Numerous historical
datasets used for short and medium-range weather forecasts are typically
organized into a regular spatial grid structure. This arrangement closely
resembles images: each weather variable can be visualized as a map or, when
considering the temporal axis, as a video. Several classes of generative
models, comprising Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders,
or the recent Denoising Diffusion Models have largely proved their
applicability to the next-frame prediction problem, and is thus natural to test
their performance on the weather prediction benchmarks. Diffusion models are
particularly appealing in this context, due to the intrinsically probabilistic
nature of weather forecasting: what we are really interested to model is the
probability distribution of weather indicators, whose expected value is the
most likely prediction.
<br />In our study, we focus on a specific subset of the ERA-5 dataset, which
includes hourly data pertaining to Central Europe from the years 2016 to 2021.
Within this context, we examine the efficacy of diffusion models in handling
the task of precipitation nowcasting. Our work is conducted in comparison to
the performance of well-established U-Net models, as documented in the existing
literature. Our proposed approach of Generative Ensemble Diffusion (GED)
utilizes a diffusion model to generate a set of possible weather scenarios
which are then amalgamated into a probable prediction via the use of a
post-processing network. This approach, in comparison to recent deep learning
models, substantially outperformed them in terms of overall performance.

<p class="mathjax">Although various structural optimization techniques have a sound mathematical
basis, the practical constructability of optimal designs poses a great
challenge in the manufacturing stage. Currently, there is only a limited number
of unified frameworks which output ready-to-manufacture parametric
Computer-Aided Designs (CAD) of the optimal designs. From a generative design
perspective, it is essential to have a single platform that outputs a
structurally optimized CAD model because CAD models are an integral part of
most industrial product development and manufacturing stages. This study
focuses on developing a novel unified workflow handling topology, layout and
size optimization in a single parametric platform, which subsequently outputs a
ready-to-manufacture CAD model. All such outputs are checked and validated for
structural requirements; strength, stiffness and stability in accordance with
standard codes of practice. In the proposed method, first, topology-optimal
model is generated and converted to a one-pixel-wide chain model using
skeletonization. Secondly, a spatial frame is extracted from the skeleton for
its member size and layout optimization. Finally, the CAD model is generated
using constructive solid geometry trees and the structural integrity of each
member is assessed to ensure structural robustness prior to manufacturing.
Various examples presented in the paper showcase the validity of the proposed
method across various engineering disciplines.

<p class="mathjax">Recently emerged Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks have drawn
significant attention in both computer vision and natural language processing
communities. Existing VLN tasks are built for agents that navigate on the
ground, either indoors or outdoors. However, many tasks require intelligent
agents to carry out in the sky, such as UAV-based goods delivery,
traffic/security patrol, and scenery tour, to name a few. Navigating in the sky
is more complicated than on the ground because agents need to consider the
flying height and more complex spatial relationship reasoning. To fill this gap
and facilitate research in this field, we propose a new task named AerialVLN,
which is UAV-based and towards outdoor environments. We develop a 3D simulator
rendered by near-realistic pictures of 25 city-level scenarios. Our simulator
supports continuous navigation, environment extension and configuration. We
also proposed an extended baseline model based on the widely-used
cross-modal-alignment (CMA) navigation methods. We find that there is still a
significant gap between the baseline model and human performance, which
suggests AerialVLN is a new challenging task. Dataset and code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate time series data for real-world applications typically contain a
significant amount of missing values. The dominant approach for classification
with such missing values is to impute them heuristically with specific values
(zero, mean, values of adjacent time-steps) or learnable parameters. However,
these simple strategies do not take the data generative process into account,
and more importantly, do not effectively capture the uncertainty in prediction
due to the multiple possibilities for the missing values. In this paper, we
propose a novel probabilistic framework for classification with multivariate
time series data with missing values. Our model consists of two parts; a deep
generative model for missing value imputation and a classifier. Extending the
existing deep generative models to better capture structures of time-series
data, our deep generative model part is trained to impute the missing values in
multiple plausible ways, effectively modeling the uncertainty of the
imputation. The classifier part takes the time series data along with the
imputed missing values and classifies signals, and is trained to capture the
predictive uncertainty due to the multiple possibilities of imputations.
Importantly, we show that na\"ively combining the generative model and the
classifier could result in trivial solutions where the generative model does
not produce meaningful imputations. To resolve this, we present a novel
regularization technique that can promote the model to produce useful
imputation values that help classification. Through extensive experiments on
real-world time series data with missing values, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the rapid advancement of unsupervised learning in visual
representation, it requires training on large-scale datasets that demand costly
data collection, and pose additional challenges due to concerns regarding data
privacy. Recently, synthetic images generated by text-to-image diffusion
models, have shown great potential for benefiting image recognition. Although
promising, there has been inadequate exploration dedicated to unsupervised
learning on diffusion-generated images. To address this, we start by uncovering
that diffusion models' cross-attention layers inherently provide
annotation-free attention masks aligned with corresponding text inputs on
generated images. We then investigate the problems of three prevalent
unsupervised learning techniques ( i.e., contrastive learning, masked modeling,
and vision-language pretraining) and introduce customized solutions by fully
exploiting the aforementioned free attention masks. Our approach is validated
through extensive experiments that show consistent improvements in baseline
models across various downstream tasks, including image classification,
detection, segmentation, and image-text retrieval. By utilizing our method, it
is possible to close the performance gap between unsupervised pretraining on
synthetic data and real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS) is a common dimensionality reduction
technique for data fusion, which projects data samples from two views by
seeking linear combinations with a small number of variables with the maximum
variance. However, sPLS extracts the combinations between two data sets with
all data samples so that it cannot detect latent subsets of samples. To extend
the application of sPLS by identifying a specific subset of samples and remove
outliers, we propose an $\ell_\infty/\ell_0$-norm constrained weighted sparse
PLS ($\ell_\infty/\ell_0$-wsPLS) method for joint sample and feature selection,
where the $\ell_\infty/\ell_0$-norm constrains are used to select a subset of
samples. We prove that the $\ell_\infty/\ell_0$-norm constrains have the
Kurdyka-\L{ojasiewicz}~property so that a globally convergent algorithm is
developed to solve it. Moreover, multi-view data with a same set of samples can
be available in various real problems. To this end, we extend the
$\ell_\infty/\ell_0$-wsPLS model and propose two multi-view wsPLS models for
multi-view data fusion. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm for each
multi-view wsPLS model and show its convergence property. As well as numerical
and biomedical data experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an extension of the Mirror Descent method to overcome
challenges in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) settings,
where agents have varying abilities and individual policies. The proposed
Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Descent Policy Optimization (HAMDPO) algorithm
utilizes the multi-agent advantage decomposition lemma to enable efficient
policy updates for each agent while ensuring overall performance improvements.
By iteratively updating agent policies through an approximate solution of the
trust-region problem, HAMDPO guarantees stability and improves performance.
Moreover, the HAMDPO algorithm is capable of handling both continuous and
discrete action spaces for heterogeneous agents in various MARL problems. We
evaluate HAMDPO on Multi-Agent MuJoCo and StarCraftII tasks, demonstrating its
superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms such as HATRPO and HAPPO. These
results suggest that HAMDPO is a promising approach for solving cooperative
MARL problems and could potentially be extended to address other challenging
problems in the field of MARL.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a non-linear Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC)
for obstacle avoidance in automated vehicles driven at the limit of handling.
The proposed controller integrates motion planning, path tracking and vehicle
stability objectives, prioritising obstacle avoidance in emergencies. The
controller's prediction model is a non-linear single-track vehicle model with
the Fiala tyre to capture the vehicle's non-linear behaviour. The MPCC computes
the optimal steering angle and brake torques to minimise tracking error in safe
situations and maximise the vehicle-to-obstacle distance in emergencies.
Furthermore, the MPCC is extended with the tyre friction circle to fully
exploit the vehicle's manoeuvrability and stability. The MPCC controller is
tested using real-time rapid prototyping hardware to prove its real-time
capability. The performance is compared with a state-of-the-art Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in a high-fidelity simulation environment. The double
lane change scenario results demonstrate a significant improvement in
successfully avoiding obstacles and maintaining vehicle stability.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of scene text image super-resolution is to reconstruct
high-resolution text-line images from unrecognizable low-resolution inputs. The
existing methods relying on the optimization of pixel-level loss tend to yield
text edges that exhibit a notable degree of blurring, thereby exerting a
substantial impact on both the readability and recognizability of the text. To
address these issues, we propose TextDiff, the first diffusion-based framework
tailored for scene text image super-resolution. It contains two modules: the
Text Enhancement Module (TEM) and the Mask-Guided Residual Diffusion Module
(MRD). The TEM generates an initial deblurred text image and a mask that
encodes the spatial location of the text. The MRD is responsible for
effectively sharpening the text edge by modeling the residuals between the
ground-truth images and the initial deblurred images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our TextDiff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
public benchmark datasets and can improve the readability of scene text images.
Moreover, our proposed MRD module is plug-and-play that effectively sharpens
the text edges produced by SOTA methods. This enhancement not only improves the
readability and recognizability of the results generated by SOTA methods but
also does not require any additional joint training. Available

<p class="mathjax">Generative Language Models (GLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks
such as text generation, understanding, and reasoning. However, the large model
size poses challenges for practical deployment. To solve this problem,
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has become increasingly popular. However,
current QAT methods for generative models have resulted in a noticeable loss of

method specifically designed for GLMs. Our method, called token-scaled logit
distillation, prevents overfitting and provides superior learning from the

<p class="mathjax">In this work, by re-examining the "matching" nature of Anomaly Detection
(AD), we propose a new AD framework that simultaneously enjoys new records of
AD accuracy and dramatically high running speed. In this framework, the anomaly
detection problem is solved via a cascade patch retrieval procedure that
retrieves the nearest neighbors for each test image patch in a coarse-to-fine
fashion. Given a test sample, the top-K most similar training images are first
selected based on a robust histogram matching process. Secondly, the nearest
neighbor of each test patch is retrieved over the similar geometrical locations
on those "global nearest neighbors", by using a carefully trained local metric.
Finally, the anomaly score of each test image patch is calculated based on the
distance to its "local nearest neighbor" and the "non-background" probability.
The proposed method is termed "Cascade Patch Retrieval" (CPR) in this work.
Different from the conventional patch-matching-based AD algorithms, CPR selects
proper "targets" (reference images and locations) before "shooting"
(patch-matching). On the well-acknowledged MVTec AD, BTAD and MVTec-3D AD
datasets, the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms all the comparing
SOTA methods by remarkable margins, measured by various AD metrics.
Furthermore, CPR is extremely efficient. It runs at the speed of 113 FPS with
the standard setting while its simplified version only requires less than 1 ms
to process an image at the cost of a trivial accuracy drop. The code of CPR is
available at https://github.com/flyinghu123/CPR.

<p class="mathjax">Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) has received considerable attention in
recent years. One of the critical requirements of LLVE is inter-frame
brightness consistency, which is essential for maintaining the temporal
coherence of the enhanced video. However, most existing single-image-based
methods fail to address this issue, resulting in flickering effect that
degrades the overall quality after enhancement. Moreover, 3D Convolution Neural
Network (CNN)-based methods, which are designed for video to maintain
inter-frame consistency, are computationally expensive, making them impractical
for real-time applications. To address these issues, we propose an efficient
pipeline named FastLLVE that leverages the Look-Up-Table (LUT) technique to
maintain inter-frame brightness consistency effectively. Specifically, we
design a learnable Intensity-Aware LUT (IA-LUT) module for adaptive
enhancement, which addresses the low-dynamic problem in low-light scenarios.
This enables FastLLVE to perform low-latency and low-complexity enhancement
operations while maintaining high-quality results. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) performance in terms of both image quality and inter-frame brightness
consistency. More importantly, our FastLLVE can process 1,080p videos at
$\mathit{50+}$ Frames Per Second (FPS), which is $\mathit{2 \times}$ faster
than SOTA CNN-based methods in inference time, making it a promising solution
for real-time applications. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">A challenge of channel pruning is designing efficient and effective criteria
to select channels to prune. A widely used criterion is minimal performance
degeneration. To accurately evaluate the truth performance degeneration
requires retraining the survived weights to convergence, which is prohibitively
slow. Hence existing pruning methods use previous weights (without retraining)
to evaluate the performance degeneration. However, we observe the loss changes
differ significantly with and without retraining. It motivates us to develop a
technique to evaluate true loss changes without retraining, with which channels
to prune can be selected more reliably and confidently. We first derive a
closed-form estimator of the true loss change per pruning mask change, using
influence functions without retraining. Influence function which is from robust
statistics reveals the impacts of a training sample on the model's prediction
and is repurposed by us to assess impacts on true loss changes. We then show
how to assess the importance of all channels simultaneously and develop a novel
global channel pruning algorithm accordingly. We conduct extensive experiments
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first that shows evaluating true loss changes for pruning
without retraining is possible. This finding will open up opportunities for a
series of new paradigms to emerge that differ from existing pruning methods.

lives and causing significant social and economic disruptions. In order to
optimize decision-making and allocate limited resources, it is essential to
identify COVID-19 symptoms and determine the severity of each case. Machine

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) presents a unique challenge in
machine learning, as it necessitates the continuous learning of new classes
from sparse labeled training samples without forgetting previous knowledge.
While this field has seen recent progress, it remains an active area of
exploration. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review
of FSCIL. In our in-depth examination, we delve into various facets of FSCIL,
encompassing the problem definition, the discussion of primary challenges of
unreliable empirical risk minimization and the stability-plasticity dilemma,
general schemes, and relevant problems of incremental learning and few-shot
learning. Besides, we offer an overview of benchmark datasets and evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we introduce the classification methods in FSCIL from
data-based, structure-based, and optimization-based approaches and the object
detection methods in FSCIL from anchor-free and anchor-based approaches. Beyond
these, we illuminate several promising research directions within FSCIL that
merit further investigation.

<p class="mathjax">Modern deep neural networks, particularly recent large language models, come
with massive model sizes that require significant computational and storage
resources. To enable the deployment of modern models on resource-constrained
environments and accelerate inference time, researchers have increasingly
explored pruning techniques as a popular research direction in neural network
compression. However, there is a dearth of up-to-date comprehensive review
papers on pruning. To address this issue, in this survey, we provide a
comprehensive review of existing research works on deep neural network pruning
in a taxonomy of 1) universal/specific speedup, 2) when to prune, 3) how to
prune, and 4) fusion of pruning and other compression techniques. We then
provide a thorough comparative analysis of seven pairs of contrast settings for
pruning (e.g., unstructured/structured) and explore emerging topics, including
post-training pruning, different levels of supervision for pruning, and broader
applications (e.g., adversarial robustness) to shed light on the commonalities
and differences of existing methods and lay the foundation for further method
development. To facilitate future research, we build a curated collection of
datasets, networks, and evaluations on different applications. Finally, we
provide some valuable recommendations on selecting pruning methods and prospect
promising research directions. We build a repository at
https://github.com/hrcheng1066/awesome-pruning.

<p class="mathjax">Brain tissue segmentation is essential for neuroscience and clinical studies.
However, segmentation on longitudinal data is challenging due to dynamic brain
changes across the lifespan. Previous researches mainly focus on
self-supervision with regularizations and will lose longitudinal generalization
when fine-tuning on a specific age group. In this paper, we propose a dual
meta-learning paradigm to learn longitudinally consistent representations and
persist when fine-tuning. Specifically, we learn a plug-and-play feature
extractor to extract longitudinal-consistent anatomical representations by
meta-feature learning and a well-initialized task head for fine-tuning by
meta-initialization learning. Besides, two class-aware regularizations are
proposed to encourage longitudinal consistency. Experimental results on the
iSeg2019 and ADNI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ladderlab-xjtu/DuMeta.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised learning is attracting blooming attention, due to its success
in combining unlabeled data. To mitigate potentially incorrect pseudo labels,
recent frameworks mostly set a fixed confidence threshold to discard uncertain
samples. This practice ensures high-quality pseudo labels, but incurs a
relatively low utilization of the whole unlabeled set. In this work, our key
insight is that these uncertain samples can be turned into certain ones, as
long as the confusion classes for the top-1 class are detected and removed.
Invoked by this, we propose a novel method dubbed ShrinkMatch to learn
uncertain samples. For each uncertain sample, it adaptively seeks a shrunk
class space, which merely contains the original top-1 class, as well as
remaining less likely classes. Since the confusion ones are removed in this
space, the re-calculated top-1 confidence can satisfy the pre-defined
threshold. We then impose a consistency regularization between a pair of
strongly and weakly augmented samples in the shrunk space to strive for
discriminative representations. Furthermore, considering the varied reliability
among uncertain samples and the gradually improved model during training, we
correspondingly design two reweighting principles for our uncertain loss. Our
method exhibits impressive performance on widely adopted benchmarks. Code is
available at https://github.com/LiheYoung/ShrinkMatch.

<p class="mathjax">Contemporary state-of-the-art neural networks have increasingly large numbers
of parameters, which prevents their deployment on devices with limited
computational power. Pruning is one technique to remove unnecessary weights and
reduce resource requirements for training and inference. In addition, for ML
tasks where the input data is multi-dimensional, using higher-dimensional data
embeddings such as complex numbers or quaternions has been shown to reduce the
parameter count while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we conduct pruning on
real and quaternion-valued implementations of different architectures on
classification tasks. We find that for some architectures, at very high
sparsity levels, quaternion models provide higher accuracies than their real
counterparts. For example, at the task of image classification on CIFAR-10
using Conv-4, at $3\%$ of the number of parameters as the original model, the
pruned quaternion version outperforms the pruned real by more than $10\%$.
Experiments on various network architectures and datasets show that for
deployment in extremely resource-constrained environments, a sparse quaternion
network might be a better candidate than a real sparse model of similar
architecture.

<p class="mathjax">Penetration testing, a crucial industrial practice for ensuring system
security, has traditionally resisted automation due to the extensive expertise
required by human professionals. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant advancements in various domains, and their emergent abilities
suggest their potential to revolutionize industries. In this research, we
evaluate the performance of LLMs on real-world penetration testing tasks using
a robust benchmark created from test machines with platforms. Our findings
reveal that while LLMs demonstrate proficiency in specific sub-tasks within the
penetration testing process, such as using testing tools, interpreting outputs,
and proposing subsequent actions, they also encounter difficulties maintaining
an integrated understanding of the overall testing scenario.
<br />In response to these insights, we introduce PentestGPT, an LLM-empowered
automatic penetration testing tool that leverages the abundant domain knowledge
inherent in LLMs. PentestGPT is meticulously designed with three
self-interacting modules, each addressing individual sub-tasks of penetration
testing, to mitigate the challenges related to context loss. Our evaluation
shows that PentestGPT not only outperforms LLMs with a task-completion increase
of 228.6\% compared to the \gptthree model among the benchmark targets but also
proves effective in tackling real-world penetration testing challenges. Having
been open-sourced on GitHub, PentestGPT has garnered over 4,700 stars and
fostered active community engagement, attesting to its value and impact in both
the academic and industrial spheres.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual Reality (VR) technology has become increasingly popular in recent
years as a key enabler of the Metaverse. VR applications have unique
characteristics, including the revolutionized human-computer interaction
mechanisms, that distinguish them from traditional software. Hence, user
expectations for the software quality of VR applications diverge from those for
traditional software. Investigating these quality expectations is crucial for
the effective development and maintenance of VR applications, which remains an
under-explored area in prior research.
<br />To bridge the gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study to model
the software quality of VR applications from users' perspectives. To this end,
we analyze 1,132,056 user reviews of 14,150 VR applications across seven app
stores through a semiautomatic review mining approach. We construct a taxonomy
of 12 software quality attributes that are of major concern to VR users. Our
analysis reveals that the VR-specific quality attributes are of utmost
importance to users, which are closely related to the most unique properties of
VR applications like revolutionized interaction mechanisms and immersive
experiences. Our examination of relevant user complaints reveals the major
factors impacting user satisfaction with VR-specific quality attributes. We
identify that poor design or implementation of the movement mechanisms, control
mechanisms, multimedia systems, and physics, can significantly degrade the user
experience. Moreover, we discuss the implications of VR quality assurance for
both developers and researchers to shed light on future work. For instance, we
suggest developers implement sufficient accessibility and comfort options for
users with mobility limitations, sensory impairments, and other specific needs
to customize the interaction mechanisms. Our datasets and results will be
released to facilitate follow-up studies.

<p class="mathjax">Intentionally applying impacts while maintaining balance is challenging for
legged robots. This study originated from observing experimental data of the
humanoid robot HRP-4 intentionally hitting a wall with its right arm while
standing on two feet. Strangely, violating the usual zero moment point balance
criteria did not systematically result in a fall. To investigate this
phenomenon, we propose the zero-step capture region for non-coplanar contacts,
defined as the center of mass (CoM) velocity area, and validated it with
push-recovery experiments employing the HRP-4 balancing on two non-coplanar
contacts. To further enable on-purpose impacts, we compute the set of candidate
post-impact CoM velocities accounting for frictional-impact dynamics in three
dimensions, and restrict the entire set within the CoM velocity area to
maintain balance with the sustained contacts during and after impacts. We
illustrate the maximum contact velocity for various HRP-4 stances in
simulation, indicating potential for integration into other task-space
whole-body controllers or planners. This study is the first to address the
challenging problem of applying an intentional impact with a
kinematic-controlled humanoid robot on non-coplanar contacts.

Intersection scenarios are challenging due to the complex interaction between
vehicles; to cope with it, we extend the program logic dFHL in the previous

<p class="mathjax">Due to the increasing volume of Electric Vehicles in automotive markets and
the limited lifetime of onboard lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the large-scale
retirement of LIBs is imminent. The battery packs retired from Electric
Vehicles still own 70%-80% of the initial capacity, thus having the potential
to be utilized in scenarios with lower energy and power requirements to
maximize the value of LIBs. However, spent batteries are commonly less reliable
than fresh batteries due to their degraded performance, thereby necessitating a
comprehensive assessment from safety and economic perspectives before further
utilization. To this end, this paper reviews the key technological and economic
aspects of second-life batteries (SLBs). Firstly, we introduce various
degradation models for first-life batteries and identify an opportunity to
combine physics-based theories with data-driven methods to establish
explainable models with physical laws that can be generalized. However,
degradation models specifically tailored to SLBs are currently absent.
Therefore, we analyze the applicability of existing battery degradation models
developed for first-life batteries in SLB applications. Secondly, we
investigate fast screening and regrouping techniques and discuss the regrouping
standards for the first time to guide the classification procedure and enhance
the performance and safety of SLBs. Thirdly, we scrutinize the economic
analysis of SLBs and summarize the potentially profitable applications.
Finally, we comprehensively examine and compare power electronics technologies
that can substantially improve the performance of SLBs, including
high-efficiency energy transformation technologies, active equalization
technologies, and technologies to improve reliability and safety.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as one of the biology-inspired models have
received much attention recently. It can significantly reduce energy
consumption since they quantize the real-valued membrane potentials to 0/1
spikes to transmit information thus the multiplications of activations and
weights can be replaced by additions when implemented on hardware. However,
this quantization mechanism will inevitably introduce quantization error, thus
causing catastrophic information loss. To address the quantization error
problem, we propose a regularizing membrane potential loss (RMP-Loss) to adjust
the distribution which is directly related to quantization error to a range
close to the spikes. Our method is extremely simple to implement and
straightforward to train an SNN. Furthermore, it is shown to consistently
outperform previous state-of-the-art methods over different network
architectures and datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Organizations of all kinds, whether public or private, profit-driven or
non-profit, and across various industries and sectors, rely on dashboards for
effective data visualization. However, the reliability and efficacy of these
dashboards rely on the quality of the visual and data they present. Studies
show that less than a quarter of dashboards provide information about their
sources, which is just one of the expected metadata when provenance is
seriously considered. Provenance is a record that describes people,
organizations, entities, and activities that had a role in the production,
influence, or delivery of a piece of data or an object. This paper aims to
provide a provenance representation model, that entitles standardization,
modeling, generation, capture, and visualization, specifically designed for
dashboards and its visual and data components. The proposed model will offer a
comprehensive set of essential provenance metadata that enables users to
evaluate the quality, consistency, and reliability of the information presented
on dashboards. This will allow a clear and precise understanding of the context
in which a specific dashboard was developed, ultimately leading to better
decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">LIDAR-based 3D object detection and classification is crucial for autonomous
driving. However, inference in real-time from extremely sparse 3D data poses a
formidable challenge. To address this issue, a common approach is to project
point clouds onto a bird's-eye or perspective view, effectively converting them
into an image-like data format. However, this excessive compression of point
cloud data often leads to the loss of information. This paper proposes a 3D
object detector based on voxel and projection double branch feature extraction
(PV-SSD) to address the problem of information loss. We add voxel features
input containing rich local semantic information, which is fully fused with the
projected features in the feature extraction stage to reduce the local
information loss caused by projection. A good performance is achieved compared
to the previous work. In addition, this paper makes the following
contributions: 1) a voxel feature extraction method with variable receptive
fields is proposed; 2) a feature point sampling method by weight sampling is
used to filter out the feature points that are more conducive to the detection
task; 3) the MSSFA module is proposed based on the SSFA module. To verify the
effectiveness of our method, we designed comparison experiments.

<p class="mathjax">A common approach to quantifying model interpretability is to calculate
faithfulness metrics based on iteratively masking input tokens and measuring
how much the predicted label changes as a result. However, we show that such
metrics are generally not suitable for comparing the interpretability of
different neural text classifiers as the response to masked inputs is highly
model-specific. We demonstrate that iterative masking can produce large
variation in faithfulness scores between comparable models, and show that
masked samples are frequently outside the distribution seen during training. We
further investigate the impact of adversarial attacks and adversarial training
on faithfulness scores, and demonstrate the relevance of faithfulness measures
for analyzing feature salience in text adversarial attacks. Our findings
provide new insights into the limitations of current faithfulness metrics and
key considerations to utilize them appropriately.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
representation learning for graphs recently. However, the effectiveness of
GNNs, which capitalize on the key operation of message propagation, highly
depends on the quality of the topology structure. Most of the graphs in
real-world scenarios follow a long-tailed distribution on their node degrees,
that is, a vast majority of the nodes in the graph are tail nodes with only a
few connected edges. GNNs produce inferior node representations for tail nodes
since they lack structural information. In the pursuit of promoting the
expressiveness of GNNs for tail nodes, we explore how the deficiency of
structural information deteriorates the performance of tail nodes and propose a
general Structural Augmentation based taIL nOde Representation learning
framework, dubbed as SAILOR, which can jointly learn to augment the graph
structure and extract more informative representations for tail nodes.
Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAILOR can
significantly improve the tail node representations and outperform the
state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Modern large-scale distributed storage systems use erasure codes to protect
against node failures with low storage overhead. In practice, the failure rate
and other factors of storage devices in the system may vary significantly over
time, and leads to changes of the ideal code parameters. To maintain the
storage efficiency, this requires the system to adjust parameters of the
currently used codes. The changing process of code parameters on encoded data
is called code conversion.
<br />As an important class of storage codes, locally repairable codes (LRCs) can
repair any codeword symbol using a small number of other symbols. This feature
makes LRCs highly efficient for addressing single node failures in the storage
systems. In this paper, we investigate the code conversions for locally
repairable codes in the merge regime. We establish a lower bound on the access
cost of code conversion for general LRCs and propose a general construction of
LRCs that can perform code conversions with access cost matching this bound.
This construction provides a family of LRCs together with optimal conversion
process over the field of size linear in the code length.

<p class="mathjax">Edge computing has become a promising computing paradigm for building IoT
(Internet of Things) applications, particularly for applications with specific
constraints such as latency or privacy requirements. Due to resource
constraints at the edge, it is important to efficiently utilize all available
computing resources to satisfy these constraints. A key challenge in utilizing
these computing resources is the scheduling of different computing tasks in a
dynamically varying, highly hybrid computing environment. This paper described
the design, implementation, and evaluation of a distributed scheduler for the
edge that constantly monitors the current state of the computing infrastructure
and dynamically schedules various computing tasks to ensure that all
application constraints are met. This scheduler has been extensively evaluated
with real-world AI applications under different scenarios and demonstrates that
it outperforms current scheduling approaches in satisfying various application
constraints.

the dynamics of a financial asset, was first transformed into a

discretize time and price, and introduced a tuning parameter to enhance the
convection term. Specified the boundary and initial conditions for call and put
options of European options, and performed numerical calculations to obtain a
numerical solution and error estimation. By varying the strength of the strike
price and risk-free interest rate, we explored the accuracy and stability of
our predicted prices. Finally, we compared our proposed method with those
obtained using the Crank-Nicolson Finite Difference Method (CFDM) and Monte

our proposed method, which outperformed the CFDM and Monte Carlo methods in

there still lacks a straightforward way to transit high-level tasks in the

<p class="mathjax">Sleep is the primary mean of recovery from accumulated fatigue and thus plays
a crucial role in fostering people's mental and physical well-being. Sleep
quality monitoring systems are often implemented using wearables that leverage
their sensing capabilities to provide sleep behaviour insights and
recommendations to users. Building models to estimate sleep quality from sensor
data is a challenging task, due to the variability of both physiological data,
perception of sleep quality, and the daily routine across users. This challenge
gauges the need for a comprehensive dataset that includes information about the
daily behaviour of users, physiological signals as well as the perceived sleep
quality. In this paper, we try to narrow this gap by proposing Bilateral Heart
rate from multiple devices and body positions for Sleep measurement (BiHeartS)
dataset. The dataset is collected in the wild from 10 participants for 30
consecutive nights. Both research-grade and commercial wearable devices are
included in the data collection campaign. Also, comprehensive self-reports are
collected about the sleep quality and the daily routine.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of $X$-secure $T$-private linear computation with graph based
replicated storage (GXSTPLC) is to enable the user to retrieve a linear
combination of messages privately from a set of $N$ distributed servers where
every message is only allowed to store among a subset of servers subject to an
$X$-security constraint, i.e., any groups of up to $X$ colluding servers must
reveal nothing about the messages. Besides, any groups of up to $T$ servers
cannot learn anything about the coefficients of the linear combination
retrieved by the user. In this work, we completely characterize the asymptotic
capacity of GXSTPLC, i.e., the supremum of average number of desired symbols
retrieved per downloaded symbol, in the limit as the number of messages $K$
approaches infinity. Specifically, it is shown that a prior linear programming
based upper bound on the asymptotic capacity of GXSTPLC due to Jia and Jafar is
tight by constructing achievability schemes. Notably, our achievability scheme
also settles the exact capacity (i.e., for finite $K$) of $X$-secure linear
combination with graph based replicated storage (GXSLC). Our achievability
proof builds upon an achievability scheme for a closely related problem named
asymmetric $\mathbf{X}$-secure $\mathbf{T}$-private linear computation with
graph based replicated storage (Asymm-GXSTPLC) that guarantees non-uniform
security and privacy levels across messages and coefficients. In particular, by
carefully designing Asymm-GXSTPLC settings for GXSTPLC problems, the
corresponding Asymm-GXSTPLC schemes can be reduced to asymptotic capacity
achieving schemes for GXSTPLC. In regard to the achievability scheme for
Asymm-GXSTPLC, interesting aspects of our construction include a novel query
and answer design which makes use of a Vandermonde decomposition of Cauchy
matrices, and a trade-off among message replication, security and privacy
thresholds.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML) can be incredibly valuable to automate anomaly
detection and cyber-attack classification, improving the way that Network
Intrusion Detection (NID) is performed. However, despite the benefits of ML
models, they are highly susceptible to adversarial cyber-attack examples
specifically crafted to exploit them. A wide range of adversarial attacks have
been created and researchers have worked on various defense strategies to
safeguard ML models, but most were not intended for the specific constraints of
a communication network and its communication protocols, so they may lead to
unrealistic examples in the NID domain. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)
consolidates and summarizes the state-of-the-art adversarial learning
approaches that can generate realistic examples and could be used in real ML
development and deployment scenarios with real network traffic flows. This SoK
also describes the open challenges regarding the use of adversarial ML in the
NID domain, defines the fundamental properties that are required for an
adversarial example to be realistic, and provides guidelines for researchers to
ensure that their future experiments are adequate for a real communication
network.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has emerged as a prominent field in recent literature,
showcasing the introduction of models that utilize transfer learning to achieve
remarkable accuracies in the classification of brain tumor MRI images. However,
the majority of these proposals primarily focus on balanced datasets,
neglecting the inherent data imbalance present in real-world scenarios.
Consequently, there is a pressing need for approaches that not only address the
data imbalance but also prioritize precise classification of brain cancer. In
this work, we present a novel deep learning-based approach, called Transfer
Learning-CNN, for brain tumor classification using MRI data. The proposed model
leverages the predictive capabilities of existing publicly available models by
utilizing their pre-trained weights and transferring those weights to the CNN.
By leveraging a publicly available Brain MRI dataset, the experiment evaluated
various transfer learning models for classifying different tumor types,
including meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors. We investigate the impact
of different loss functions, including focal loss, and oversampling methods,
such as SMOTE and ADASYN, in addressing the data imbalance issue. Notably, the
proposed strategy, which combines VGG-16 and CNN, achieved an impressive
accuracy rate of 96%, surpassing alternative approaches significantly.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to collaborate on building a machine learning model without
sharing their private data. Although FL is considered privacy-preserved by
design, recent data reconstruction attacks demonstrate that an attacker can
recover clients' training data based on the parameters shared in FL. However,
most existing methods fail to attack the most widely used horizontal Federated
Averaging (FedAvg) scenario, where clients share model parameters after
multiple local training steps. To tackle this issue, we propose an
interpolation-based approximation method, which makes attacking FedAvg
scenarios feasible by generating the intermediate model updates of the clients'
local training processes. Then, we design a layer-wise weighted loss function
to improve the data quality of reconstruction. We assign different weights to
model updates in different layers concerning the neural network structure, with
the weights tuned by Bayesian optimization. Finally, experimental results
validate the superiority of our proposed approximate and weighted attack (AWA)
method over the other state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by the
substantial improvement in different evaluation metrics for image data
reconstructions.

result encompasses and significantly extends the graph classes that were
previously known to admit a constant competitive ratio. The main ingredient of
our proof is that we find a connection between the performance of the

Conversely, we exploit this connection to construct light spanners of bounded
genus graphs. In particular, we achieve a lightness that improves on the best

<p class="mathjax">Deep graph clustering, which aims to group nodes into disjoint clusters by
neural networks in an unsupervised manner, has attracted great attention in
recent years. Although the performance has been largely improved, the excellent
performance of the existing methods heavily relies on an accurately predefined
cluster number, which is not always available in the real-world scenario. To
enable the deep graph clustering algorithms to work without the guidance of the
predefined cluster number, we propose a new deep graph clustering method termed
Reinforcement Graph Clustering (RGC). In our proposed method, cluster number
determination and unsupervised representation learning are unified into a
uniform framework by the reinforcement learning mechanism. Concretely, the
discriminative node representations are first learned with the contrastive
pretext task. Then, to capture the clustering state accurately with both local
and global information in the graph, both node and cluster states are
considered. Subsequently, at each state, the qualities of different cluster
numbers are evaluated by the quality network, and the greedy action is executed
to determine the cluster number. In order to conduct feedback actions, the
clustering-oriented reward function is proposed to enhance the cohesion of the
same clusters and separate the different clusters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The source
code of RGC is shared at https://github.com/yueliu1999/RGC and a collection
(papers, codes and, datasets) of deep graph clustering is shared at
https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Graph-Clustering on Github.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel ensemble approach for question classification
using state-of-the-art models -- Electra, GloVe, and LSTM. The proposed model
is trained and evaluated on the TREC dataset, a well-established benchmark for
question classification tasks. The ensemble model combines the strengths of
Electra, a transformer-based model for language understanding, GloVe, a global
vectors for word representation, and LSTM, a recurrent neural network variant,
providing a robust and efficient solution for question classification.
Extensive experiments were carried out to compare the performance of the
proposed ensemble approach with other cutting-edge models, such as BERT,
RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble model
outperforms these models across all evaluation metrics, achieving an accuracy
of 0.8 on the test set. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the
ensemble approach in enhancing the performance of question classification
tasks, and invite further exploration of ensemble methods in natural language
processing.

<p class="mathjax">One of the major barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in medicine
is the perception they use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions
that are inherently different from the cognitive processes of clinicians. In
this manuscript we develop novel diagnostic reasoning prompts to study whether
LLMs can perform clinical reasoning to accurately form a diagnosis. We find
that GPT4 can be prompted to mimic the common clinical reasoning processes of
clinicians without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. This is significant because
an LLM that can use clinical reasoning to provide an interpretable rationale
offers physicians a means to evaluate whether LLMs can be trusted for patient
care. Novel prompting methods have the potential to expose the black box of
LLMs, bringing them one step closer to safe and effective use in medicine.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian Neural Networks (BayesNNs) have demonstrated their capability of
providing calibrated prediction for safety-critical applications such as
medical imaging and autonomous driving. However, the high algorithmic
complexity and the poor hardware performance of BayesNNs hinder their
deployment in real-life applications. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
novel multi-exit Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD)-based BayesNN that achieves
well-calibrated predictions with low algorithmic complexity. To further reduce
the barrier to adopting BayesNNs, we propose a transformation framework that
can generate FPGA-based accelerators for multi-exit MCD-based BayesNNs. Several
novel optimization techniques are introduced to improve hardware performance.
Our experiments demonstrate that our auto-generated accelerator achieves higher

and organizations. Past well-known examples of software supply chain attacks
are the SolarWinds or log4j incidents that have affected thousands of customers
and businesses. The US government and industry are equally interested in
enhancing software supply chain security. On June 7, 2023, researchers from the
NSF-supported Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a Secure
Software Supply Chain Summit with a diverse set of 17 practitioners from 13
government agencies. The goal of the Summit was two-fold: (1) to share our
observations from our previous two summits with industry, and (2) to enable
sharing between individuals at the government agencies regarding practical
experiences and challenges with software supply chain security. For each
discussion topic, we presented our observations and take-aways from the
industry summits to spur conversation. We specifically focused on the Executive
Order 14028, software bill of materials (SBOMs), choosing new dependencies,
provenance and self-attestation, and large language models. The open
discussions enabled mutual sharing and shed light on common challenges that
government agencies see as impacting government and industry practitioners when

<p class="mathjax">Throughout the analytical revolution that has occurred in the NBA, the
development of specific metrics and formulas has given teams, coaches, and
players a new way to see the game. However - the question arises - how can we
verify any metrics? One method would simply be eyeball approximation (trying
out many different gameplans) and/or trial and error - an estimation-based and
costly approach. Another approach is to try to model already existing metrics
with a unique set of features using machine learning techniques. The key to
this approach is that with these features that are selected, we can try to
gauge the effectiveness of these features combined, rather than using
individual analysis in simple metric evaluation. If we have an accurate model,
it can particularly help us determine the specifics of gameplan execution. In
this paper, the statistic ORTG (Offensive Rating, developed by Dean Oliver) was
found to have a correlation with different NBA playtypes using both a linear
regression model and a neural network regression model, although ultimately, a
neural network worked slightly better than linear regression. Using the
accuracy of the models as a justification, the next step was to optimize the

<p class="mathjax">The volume of User Generated Content (UGC) has increased in recent years. The
challenge with this type of content is assessing its quality. So far, the
state-of-the-art metrics are not exhibiting a very high correlation with
perceptual quality. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art metrics that
extract/combine natural scene statistics and deep neural network features. We
experiment with these by introducing saliency maps to improve perceptibility.
We train and test our models using public datasets, namely, YouTube-UGC and
KoNViD-1k. Preliminary results indicate that high correlations are achieved by
using only deep features while adding saliency is not always boosting the
performance. Our results and code will be made publicly available to serve as a

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks have proven to be highly effective when large amounts of
data with clean labels are available. However, their performance degrades when
training data contains noisy labels, leading to poor generalization on the test
set. Real-world datasets contain noisy label samples that either have similar
visual semantics to other classes (in-distribution) or have no semantic
relevance to any class (out-of-distribution) in the dataset. Most
state-of-the-art methods leverage ID labeled noisy samples as unlabeled data
for semi-supervised learning, but OOD labeled noisy samples cannot be used in
this way because they do not belong to any class within the dataset. Hence, in
this paper, we propose incorporating the information from all the training data
by leveraging the benefits of self-supervised training. Our method aims to
extract a meaningful and generalizable embedding space for each sample
regardless of its label. Then, we employ a simple yet effective K-nearest
neighbor method to remove portions of out-of-distribution samples. By
discarding these samples, we propose an iterative "Manifold DivideMix"
algorithm to find clean and noisy samples, and train our model in a
semi-supervised way. In addition, we propose "MixEMatch", a new algorithm for
the semi-supervised step that involves mixup augmentation at the input and
final hidden representations of the model. This will extract better
representations by interpolating both in the input and manifold spaces.
Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic-noise image benchmarks and
real-world web-crawled datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework. Code is available at https://github.com/Fahim-F/ManifoldDivideMix.

<p class="mathjax">Representation learning methods have revolutionized machine learning on
networks by converting discrete network structures into continuous domains.
However, dynamic networks that evolve over time pose new challenges. To address
this, dynamic representation learning methods have gained attention, offering
benefits like reduced learning time and improved accuracy by utilizing temporal
information.
<br />T-batching is a valuable technique for training dynamic network models that
reduces training time while preserving vital conditions for accurate modeling.
However, we have identified a limitation in the training loss function used
with t-batching. Through mathematical analysis, we propose two alternative loss
functions that overcome these issues, resulting in enhanced training
performance.
<br />We extensively evaluate the proposed loss functions on synthetic and
real-world dynamic networks. The results consistently demonstrate superior
performance compared to the original loss function. Notably, in a real-world
network characterized by diverse user interaction histories, the proposed loss
functions achieved more than 26.9% enhancement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
and more than 11.8% improvement in Recall@10. These findings underscore the
efficacy of the proposed loss functions in dynamic network modeling.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce caption-guided face recognition (CGFR) as a new framework to
improve the performance of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) face recognition
(FR) systems. In contrast to combining soft biometrics (eg., facial marks,
gender, and age) with face images, in this work, we use facial descriptions
provided by face examiners as a piece of auxiliary information. However, due to
the heterogeneity of the modalities, improving the performance by directly
fusing the textual and facial features is very challenging, as both lie in
different embedding spaces. In this paper, we propose a contextual feature
aggregation module (CFAM) that addresses this issue by effectively exploiting
the fine-grained word-region interaction and global image-caption association.
Specifically, CFAM adopts a self-attention and a cross-attention scheme for
improving the intra-modality and inter-modality relationship between the image
and textual features, respectively. Additionally, we design a textual feature
refinement module (TFRM) that refines the textual features of the pre-trained
BERT encoder by updating the contextual embeddings. This module enhances the
discriminative power of textual features with a cross-modal projection loss and
realigns the word and caption embeddings with visual features by incorporating
a visual-semantic alignment loss. We implemented the proposed CGFR framework on
two face recognition models (ArcFace and AdaFace) and evaluated its performance
on the Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ dataset. Our framework significantly improves the
performance of ArcFace in both 1:1 verification and 1:N identification
protocol.

<p class="mathjax">Leveraging sensory information to aid the millimeter-wave (mmWave) and
sub-terahertz (sub-THz) beam selection process is attracting increasing
interest. This sensory data, captured for example by cameras at the
basestations, has the potential of significantly reducing the beam sweeping
overhead and enabling highly-mobile applications. The solutions developed so
far, however, have mainly considered single-candidate scenarios, i.e.,
scenarios with a single candidate user in the visual scene, and were evaluated
using synthetic datasets. To address these limitations, this paper extensively
investigates the sensing-aided beam prediction problem in a real-world
multi-object vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario and presents a
comprehensive machine learning-based framework. In particular, this paper
proposes to utilize visual and positional data to predict the optimal beam
indices as an alternative to the conventional beam sweeping approaches. For
this, a novel user (transmitter) identification solution has been developed, a
key step in realizing sensing-aided multi-candidate and multi-user beam
prediction solutions. The proposed solutions are evaluated on the large-scale
real-world DeepSense $6$G dataset. Experimental results in realistic V2I
communication scenarios indicate that the proposed solutions achieve close to
$100\%$ top-5 beam prediction accuracy for the scenarios with single-user and
close to $95\%$ top-5 beam prediction accuracy for multi-candidate scenarios.
Furthermore, the proposed approach can identify the probable transmitting
candidate with more than $93\%$ accuracy across the different scenarios. This
highlights a promising approach for nearly eliminating the beam training
overhead in mmWave/THz communication systems.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on the statistical analysis of shapes of data objects
called shape graphs, a set of nodes connected by articulated curves with
arbitrary shapes. A critical need here is a constrained registration of points
(nodes to nodes, edges to edges) across objects. This, in turn, requires
optimization over the permutation group, made challenging by differences in
nodes (in terms of numbers, locations) and edges (in terms of shapes,
placements, and sizes) across objects. This paper tackles this registration
problem using a novel neural-network architecture and involves an unsupervised
loss function developed using the elastic shape metric for curves. This
architecture results in (1) state-of-the-art matching performance and (2) an
order of magnitude reduction in the computational cost relative to baseline
approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using
both simulated data and real-world 2D and 3D shape graphs. Code and data will
be made publicly available after review to foster research.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the high mobility and easy deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
have attracted much attention in the field of wireless communication and
positioning. To meet the challenges of lack of infrastructure coverage,
uncertain sensor position and large amount of sensing data collection in
wireless sensor network (WSN), this paper presents an efficient joint data
collection and sensor positioning scheme for WSN supported by multiple UAVs.
Specifically, a UAV is set as the main UAV to collect data, and other UAVs are
used as auxiliary UAVs for sensor positioning using time difference of arrival
(TDoA). A mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem with uncertain sensor
position is established. The goal is to minimize the average positioning error
of all sensors by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectories, sensor transmission
schedule and positioning observation points (POPs). To solve this optimization
model, the original problem is decomposed into two sub-problems based on the
path discrete method. Firstly, the block coordinate descent (BCD) and
successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques are applied to iteratively
optimize the trajectory of the main UAV and the sensor transmission schedule,
so as to maximize the minimum amount of data uploaded by the sensor. Then,
based on the trajectory of the main UAV, a particle swarm optimization
(PSO)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the POPs of UAVs. Finally, the
spline curve is applied to generate the trajectories of auxiliary UAVs. The
simulation results show that the proposed scheme can meet the requirements of
data collection and has a good positioning performance.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential recommendation demonstrates the capability to recommend items by
modeling the sequential behavior of users. Traditional methods typically treat
users as sequences of items, overlooking the collaborative relationships among
them. Graph-based methods incorporate collaborative information by utilizing
the user-item interaction graph. However, these methods sometimes face
challenges in terms of time complexity and computational efficiency. To address
these limitations, this paper presents AutoSeqRec, an incremental
recommendation model specifically designed for sequential recommendation tasks.
AutoSeqRec is based on autoencoders and consists of an encoder and three
decoders within the autoencoder architecture. These components consider both
the user-item interaction matrix and the rows and columns of the item
transition matrix. The reconstruction of the user-item interaction matrix
captures user long-term preferences through collaborative filtering. In
addition, the rows and columns of the item transition matrix represent the item
out-degree and in-degree hopping behavior, which allows for modeling the user's
short-term interests. When making incremental recommendations, only the input
matrices need to be updated, without the need to update parameters, which makes
AutoSeqRec very efficient. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
AutoSeqRec outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, while showcasing
its robustness and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, which generally rely on the model's
predictions (e.g., entropy minimization) to adapt the source pretrained model
to the unlabeled target domain, suffer from noisy signals originating from 1)
incorrect or 2) open-set predictions. Long-term stable adaptation is hampered
by such noisy signals, so training models without such error accumulation is
crucial for practical TTA. To address these issues, including open-set TTA, we
propose a simple yet effective sample selection method inspired by the
following crucial empirical finding. While entropy minimization compels the
model to increase the probability of its predicted label (i.e., confidence
values), we found that noisy samples rather show decreased confidence values.
To be more specific, entropy minimization attempts to raise the confidence
values of an individual sample's prediction, but individual confidence values
may rise or fall due to the influence of signals from numerous other
predictions (i.e., wisdom of crowds). Due to this fact, noisy signals
misaligned with such 'wisdom of crowds', generally found in the correct
signals, fail to raise the individual confidence values of wrong samples,
despite attempts to increase them. Based on such findings, we filter out the
samples whose confidence values are lower in the adapted model than in the
original model, as they are likely to be noisy. Our method is widely applicable
to existing TTA methods and improves their long-term adaptation performance in
both image classification (e.g., 49.4% reduced error rates with TENT) and
semantic segmentation (e.g., 11.7% gain in mIoU with TENT).

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies task-oriented, otherwise known as goal-oriented,
communications, in a setting where a transmitter communicates with multiple
receivers, each with its own task to complete on a dataset, e.g., images,
available at the transmitter. A multi-task deep learning approach that involves
training a common encoder at the transmitter and individual decoders at the
receivers is presented for joint optimization of completing multiple tasks and
communicating with multiple receivers. By providing efficient resource
allocation at the edge of 6G networks, the proposed approach allows the
communications system to adapt to varying channel conditions and achieves
task-specific objectives while minimizing transmission overhead. Joint training
of the encoder and decoders using multi-task learning captures shared
information across tasks and optimizes the communication process accordingly.
By leveraging the broadcast nature of wireless communications, multi-receiver
task-oriented communications (MTOC) reduces the number of transmissions
required to complete tasks at different receivers. Performance evaluation
conducted on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets (with image
classification considered for different tasks) demonstrates the effectiveness
of MTOC in terms of classification accuracy and resource utilization compared
to single-task-oriented communication systems.

<p class="mathjax">The evaluation of recommendation systems is a complex task. The offline and
online evaluation metrics for recommender systems are ambiguous in their true
objectives. The majority of recently published papers benchmark their methods
using ill-posed offline evaluation methodology that often fails to predict true
online performance. Because of this, the impact that academic research has on
the industry is reduced. The aim of our research is to investigate and compare
the online performance of offline evaluation metrics. We show that penalizing
popular items and considering the time of transactions during the evaluation

<p class="mathjax">The visual object category reports of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are
notoriously sensitive to tiny, adversarial image perturbations. Because human
category reports (aka human percepts) are thought to be insensitive to those
same small-norm perturbations -- and locally stable in general -- this argues
that ANNs are incomplete scientific models of human visual perception.
Consistent with this, we show that when small-norm image perturbations are
generated by standard ANN models, human object category percepts are indeed
highly stable. However, in this very same "human-presumed-stable" regime, we
find that robustified ANNs reliably discover low-norm image perturbations that
strongly disrupt human percepts. These previously undetectable human perceptual
disruptions are massive in amplitude, approaching the same level of sensitivity
seen in robustified ANNs. Further, we show that robustified ANNs support
precise perceptual state interventions: they guide the construction of low-norm
image perturbations that strongly alter human category percepts toward specific
prescribed percepts. These observations suggest that for arbitrary starting
points in image space, there exists a set of nearby "wormholes", each leading
the subject from their current category perceptual state into a semantically
very different state. Moreover, contemporary ANN models of biological visual
processing are now accurate enough to consistently guide us to those portals.

<p class="mathjax">We present the full approximation scheme constraint decomposition (FASCD)
multilevel method for solving variational inequalities (VIs). FASCD is a common
extension of both the full approximation scheme (FAS) multigrid technique for
nonlinear partial differential equations, due to A.~Brandt, and the constraint
decomposition (CD) method introduced by X.-C.~Tai for VIs arising in
optimization. We extend the CD idea by exploiting the telescoping nature of
certain function space subset decompositions arising from multilevel mesh
hierarchies. When a reduced-space (active set) Newton method is applied as a
smoother, with work proportional to the number of unknowns on a given mesh
level, FASCD V-cycles exhibit nearly mesh-independent convergence rates, and
full multigrid cycles are optimal solvers. The example problems include
differential operators which are symmetric linear, nonsymmetric linear, and
nonlinear, in unilateral and bilateral VI problems.

<p class="mathjax">Visual feedback plays a crucial role in the process of amputation patients
completing grasping in the field of prosthesis control. However, for blind and
visually impaired (BVI) amputees, the loss of both visual and grasping
abilities makes the "easy" reach-and-grasp task a feasible challenge. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-sensory prosthesis system helping BVI amputees
with sensing, navigation and grasp operations. It combines modules of voice
interaction, environmental perception, grasp guidance, collaborative control,
and auditory/tactile feedback. In particular, the voice interaction module
receives user instructions and invokes other functional modules according to
the instructions. The environmental perception and grasp guidance module
obtains environmental information through computer vision, and feedbacks the
information to the user through auditory feedback modules (voice prompts and
spatial sound sources) and tactile feedback modules (vibration stimulation).
The prosthesis collaborative control module obtains the context information of
the grasp guidance process and completes the collaborative control of grasp
gestures and wrist angles of prosthesis in conjunction with the user's control
intention in order to achieve stable grasp of various objects. This paper
details a prototyping design (named viia-hand) and presents its preliminary
experimental verification on healthy subjects completing specific
reach-and-grasp tasks. Our results showed that, with the help of our new
design, the subjects were able to achieve a precise reach and reliable grasp of
the target objects in a relatively cluttered environment. Additionally, the
system is extremely user-friendly, as users can quickly adapt to it with
minimal training.

<p class="mathjax">It is well-established that the provenance of a scientific result is
important, sometimes more important than the actual result. For computational
analyses that involve visualization, this provenance information may contain
the steps involved in generating visualizations from raw data. Specifically,
data provenance tracks the lineage of data and process provenance tracks the
steps executed. In this paper, we argue that the utility of computational
provenance may not be as clear-cut as we might like. One common use case for
provenance is that the information can be used to reproduce the original
result. However, in visualization, the goal is often to communicate results to
a user or viewer, and thus the insights obtained are ultimately most important.
Viewers can miss important changes or react to unimportant ones. Here,
interaction provenance, which tracks a user's actions with a visualization, or
insight provenance, which tracks the decision-making process, can help capture
what happened but don't remove the issues. In this paper, we present scenarios
where provenance impacts reproducibility in different ways. We also explore how
provenance and visualizations can be better related.

<p class="mathjax">Hierarchical and tree-like data sets arise in many applications, including
language processing, graph data mining, phylogeny and genomics. It is known
that tree-like data cannot be embedded into Euclidean spaces of finite
dimension with small distortion. This problem can be mitigated through the use
of hyperbolic spaces. When such data also has to be processed in a distributed
and privatized setting, it becomes necessary to work with new federated
learning methods tailored to hyperbolic spaces. As an initial step towards the
development of the field of federated learning in hyperbolic spaces, we propose
the first known approach to federated classification in hyperbolic spaces. Our
contributions are as follows. First, we develop distributed versions of convex
SVM classifiers for Poincar\'e discs. In this setting, the information conveyed
from clients to the global classifier are convex hulls of clusters present in
individual client data. Second, to avoid label switching issues, we introduce a
number-theoretic approach for label recovery based on the so-called integer
$B_h$ sequences. Third, we compute the complexity of the convex hulls in
hyperbolic spaces to assess the extent of data leakage; at the same time, in
order to limit the communication cost for the hulls, we propose a new
quantization method for the Poincar\'e disc coupled with Reed-Solomon-like
encoding. Fourth, at server level, we introduce a new approach for aggregating
convex hulls of the clients based on balanced graph partitioning. We test our
method on a collection of diverse data sets, including hierarchical single-cell
RNA-seq data from different patients distributed across different repositories
that have stringent privacy constraints. The classification accuracy of our
method is up to $\sim 11\%$ better than its Euclidean counterpart,
demonstrating the importance of privacy-preserving learning in hyperbolic
spaces.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot video recognition (ZSVR) is a task that aims to recognize video
categories that have not been seen during the model training process. Recently,
vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs have
demonstrated impressive transferability for ZSVR. To make VLMs applicable to
the video domain, existing methods often use an additional temporal learning
module after the image-level encoder to learn the temporal relationships among
video frames. Unfortunately, for video from unseen categories, we observe an
abnormal phenomenon where the model that uses spatial-temporal feature performs
much worse than the model that removes temporal learning module and uses only
spatial feature. We conjecture that improper temporal modeling on video
disrupts the spatial feature of the video. To verify our hypothesis, we propose
Feature Factorization to retain the orthogonal temporal feature of the video
and use interpolation to construct refined spatial-temporal feature. The model
using appropriately refined spatial-temporal feature performs better than the
one using only spatial feature, which verifies the effectiveness of the
orthogonal temporal feature for the ZSVR task. Therefore, an Orthogonal
Temporal Interpolation module is designed to learn a better refined
spatial-temporal video feature during training. Additionally, a Matching Loss
is introduced to improve the quality of the orthogonal temporal feature. We
propose a model called OTI for ZSVR by employing orthogonal temporal
interpolation and the matching loss based on VLMs. The ZSVR accuracies on
popular video datasets (i.e., Kinetics-600, UCF101 and HMDB51) show that OTI
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by a clear margin.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, deep learning-based techniques have shown promising performance on
various tasks related to software engineering. For these learning-based
approaches to perform well, obtaining high-quality data is one fundamental and
crucial issue. The comment updating task is an emerging software engineering
task aiming at automatically updating the corresponding comments based on
changes in source code. However, datasets for the comment updating tasks are
usually crawled from committed versions in open source software repositories
such as GitHub, where there is lack of quality control of comments. In this
paper, we focus on cleaning existing comment updating datasets with considering
some properties of the comment updating process in software development. We
propose a semantic and overlapping-aware approach named CupCleaner (Comment
UPdating's CLEANER) to achieve this purpose. Specifically, we calculate a score
based on semantics and overlapping information of the code and comments. Based
on the distribution of the scores, we filter out the data with low scores in
the tail of the distribution to get rid of possible unclean data. We first
conducted a human evaluation on the noise data and high-quality data identified
by CupCleaner. The results show that the human ratings of the noise data
identified by CupCleaner are significantly lower. Then, we applied our data
cleaning approach to the training and validation sets of three existing comment
updating datasets while keeping the test set unchanged. Our experimental
results show that even after filtering out over 30\% of the data using
CupCleaner, there is still an improvement in all performance metrics. The
experimental results on the cleaned test set also suggest that CupCleaner may
provide help for constructing datasets for updating-related tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant progress
owing to their superior modeling capabilities. However, existing trackers are
hampered by low speed, limiting their applicability on devices with limited
computational power. To alleviate this problem, we propose HiT, a new family of
efficient tracking models that can run at high speed on different devices while
retaining high performance. The central idea of HiT is the Bridge Module, which
bridges the gap between modern lightweight transformers and the tracking
framework. The Bridge Module incorporates the high-level information of deep
features into the shallow large-resolution features. In this way, it produces
better features for the tracking head. We also propose a novel dual-image
position encoding technique that simultaneously encodes the position
information of both the search region and template images. The HiT model
achieves promising speed with competitive performance. For instance, it runs at
61 frames per second (fps) on the Nvidia Jetson AGX edge device. Furthermore,
HiT attains 64.6% AUC on the LaSOT benchmark, surpassing all previous efficient
trackers.

<p class="mathjax">The Robotics Major at the University of Michigan was successfully launched in
the 2022-23 academic year as an innovative step forward to better serve
students, our communities, and our society. Building on our guiding principle
of "Robotics with Respect" and our larger Robotics Pathways model, the Michigan
Robotics Major was designed to define robotics as a true academic discipline
with both equity and excellence as our highest priorities. Understanding that
talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not, the Michigan Robotics
Major has embraced an adaptable curriculum that is accessible through a
diversity of student pathways and enables successful and sustained career-long
participation in robotics, AI, and automation professions. The results after
our planning efforts (2019-22) and first academic year (2022-23) have been
highly encouraging: more than 100 students declared Robotics as their major,
completion of the Robotics major by our first two graduates, soaring
enrollments in our Robotics classes, thriving partnerships with Historically
Black Colleges and Universities. This document provides our original curricular
proposal for the Robotics Undergraduate Program at the University of Michigan,
submitted to the Michigan Association of State Universities in April 2022 and
approved in June 2022. The dissemination of our program design is in the spirit
of continued growth for higher education towards realizing equity and
excellence.

<p class="mathjax">It is a challenge to numerically solve nonlinear partial differential
equations whose solution involves discontinuity. In the context of numerical
simulators for multi-phase flow in porous media, there exists a long-standing
issue known as Grid Orientation Effect (GOE), wherein different numerical
solutions can be obtained when considering grids with different orientations
under certain unfavorable conditions. Our perspective is that GOE arises due to
numerical instability near displacement fronts, where spurious oscillations
accompanied by sharp fronts, if not adequately suppressed, lead to GOE. To
reduce or even eliminate GOE, we propose augmenting adaptive artificial
viscosity when solving the saturation equation. It has been demonstrated that
appropriate artificial viscosity can effectively reduce or even eliminate GOE.
The proposed numerical method can be easily applied in practical engineering
problems.

we show that AI models can help factfinders ascertain ordinary meaning in
context, quantify ambiguity, and fill gaps in parties' agreements. We also
illustrate how models can calculate the probative value of individual pieces of
extrinsic evidence. After offering best practices for the use of these models
given their limitations, we consider their implications for judicial practice
and contract theory. Using LLMs permits courts to estimate what the parties
intended cheaply and accurately, and as such generative interpretation
unsettles the current interpretative stalemate. Their use responds to
efficiency-minded textualists and justice-oriented contextualists, who argue
about whether parties will prefer cost and certainty or accuracy and fairness.
Parties--and courts--would prefer a middle path, in which adjudicators strive
to predict what the contract really meant, admitting just enough context to
approximate reality while avoiding unguided and biased assimilation of
evidence. As generative interpretation offers this possibility, we argue it can
become the new workhorse of contractual interpretation.

<p class="mathjax">Image-to-image (I2I) translation comprises a wide spectrum of tasks. Here we
divide this problem into three levels: strong-fidelity translation,
normal-fidelity translation, and weak-fidelity translation, indicating the
extent to which the content of the original image is preserved. Although
existing methods achieve good performance in weak-fidelity translation, they
fail to fully preserve the content in both strong- and normal-fidelity tasks,
e.g. sim2real, style transfer and low-level vision. In this work, we propose
Hierarchy Flow, a novel flow-based model to achieve better content preservation
during translation. Specifically, 1) we first unveil the drawbacks of standard
flow-based models when applied to I2I translation. 2) Next, we propose a new
design, namely hierarchical coupling for reversible feature transformation and
multi-scale modeling, to constitute Hierarchy Flow. 3) Finally, we present a
dedicated aligned-style loss for a better trade-off between content
preservation and stylization during translation. Extensive experiments on a
wide range of I2I translation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with convincing advantages in both strong- and
normal-fidelity tasks. Code and models will be at

<p class="mathjax">Large language models have made significant strides in natural language
processing, paving the way for innovative applications including molecular
representation and generation. However, most existing single-modality
approaches cannot capture the abundant and complex information in molecular
data. Here, we introduce GIT-Mol, a multi-modal large language model that
integrates the structure Graph, Image, and Text information, including the
Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) and molecular captions.
To facilitate the integration of multi-modal molecular data, we propose
GIT-Former, a novel architecture capable of mapping all modalities into a
unified latent space. Our study develops an innovative any-to-language
molecular translation strategy and achieves a 10%-15% improvement in molecular
captioning, a 5%-10% accuracy increase in property prediction, and a 20% boost
in molecule generation validity compared to baseline or single-modality models.

<p class="mathjax">Recent empirical evidence indicates that transformer based in-context
learning performs better when using a prefix language model (prefixLM), in
which in-context samples can all attend to each other, compared to causal
language models (causalLM), which use auto-regressive attention that prohibits
in-context samples to attend to future samples. While this result is intuitive,
it is not understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper we take a
theoretical approach and analyze the convergence behavior of prefixLM and
causalLM under a certain parameter construction. Our analysis shows that both
LM types converge to their stationary points at a linear rate, but that while
prefixLM converges to the optimal solution of linear regression, causalLM
convergence dynamics follows that of an online gradient descent algorithm,
which is not guaranteed to be optimal even as the number of samples grows
infinitely. We supplement our theoretical claims with empirical experiments
over synthetic and real tasks and using various types of transformers. Our
experiments verify that causalLM consistently underperforms prefixLM in all
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Organizations in emergency settings must cope with various sources of
disruption, most notably personnel loss. Death, incapacitation, or isolation of
individuals within an organizational communication network can impair
information passing, coordination, and connectivity, and may drive maladaptive
responses such as repeated attempts to contact lost personnel (``calling the
dead'') that themselves consume scarce resources. At the same time,
organizations may respond to such disruption by reorganizing to restore
function, a behavior that is fundamental to organizational resilience. Here, we
use empirically calibrated models of communication for 17 groups of responders
to the World Trade Center Disaster to examine the impact of exogenous removal
of personnel on communication activity and network resilience. We find that
removal of high-degree personnel and those in institutionally coordinative
roles is particularly damaging to these organizations, with specialist
responders being slower to adapt to losses. However, all organizations show
adaptations to disruption, in some cases becoming better connected and making
more complete use of personnel relative to control after experiencing losses.

<p class="mathjax">Computing educators face significant challenges in providing timely support
to students, especially in large class settings. Large language models (LLMs)
have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a
large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs
produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel
LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to
programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design
of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors,
and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure
generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed
it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and
collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students'
usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the
course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our
findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially
value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors
it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that
they provide to students.

<p class="mathjax">Deterministic planning assumes that the planning evolves along a fully
predictable path, and therefore it loses the practical value in most real
projections. A more realistic view is that planning ought to take into
consideration partial observability beforehand and aim for a more flexible and
robust solution. What is more significant, it is inevitable that the quality of
plan varies dramatically in the partially observable environment. In this paper
we propose a probabilistic contingent Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner,
named High-Quality Contingent Planner (HQCP), to generate high-quality plans in
the partially observable environment. The formalisms in HTN planning are
extended into partial observability and are evaluated regarding the cost. Next,
we explore a novel heuristic for high-quality plans and develop the integrated
planning algorithm. Finally, an empirical study verifies the effectiveness and
efficiency of the planner both in probabilistic contingent planning and for
obtaining high-quality plans.

<p class="mathjax">As a typical entity of MEC (Mobile Edge Computing), 5G CPE (Customer Premise
Equipment)/HGU (Home Gateway Unit) has proven to be a promising alternative to
traditional Smart Home Gateway. Network TC (Traffic Classification) is a vital
service quality assurance and security management method for communication
networks, which has become a crucial functional entity in 5G CPE/HGU. In recent
years, many researchers have applied Machine Learning or Deep Learning (DL) to
TC, namely AI-TC, to improve its performance. However, AI-TC faces challenges,
including data dependency, resource-intensive traffic labeling, and user
privacy concerns. The limited computing resources of 5G CPE further complicate
efficient classification. Moreover, the "black box" nature of AI-TC models
raises transparency and credibility issues. The paper proposes the FedEdge
AI-TC framework, leveraging Federated Learning (FL) for reliable Network TC in
5G CPE. FL ensures privacy by employing local training, model parameter
iteration, and centralized training. A semi-supervised TC algorithm based on
Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) reduces
data dependency while maintaining accuracy. To optimize model light-weight
deployment, the paper introduces XAI-Pruning, an AI model compression method
combined with DL model interpretability. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
FedEdge AI-TC's superiority over benchmarks in terms of accuracy and efficient
TC performance. The framework enhances user privacy and model credibility,
offering a comprehensive solution for dependable and transparent Network TC in
5G CPE, thus enhancing service quality and security.

<p class="mathjax">Online continual learning (CL) aims to learn new knowledge and consolidate
previously learned knowledge from non-stationary data streams. Due to the
time-varying training setting, the model learned from a changing distribution
easily forgets the previously learned knowledge and biases toward the newly
received task. To address this problem, we propose a Continual Bias Adaptor
(CBA) module to augment the classifier network to adapt to catastrophic
distribution change during training, such that the classifier network is able
to learn a stable consolidation of previously learned tasks. In the testing
stage, CBA can be removed which introduces no additional computation cost and
memory overhead. We theoretically reveal the reason why the proposed method can
effectively alleviate catastrophic distribution shifts, and empirically
demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments based on four
rehearsal-based baselines and three public continual learning benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">A desirable open world recognition (OWR) system requires performing three
tasks: (1) Open set recognition (OSR), i.e., classifying the known (classes
seen during training) and rejecting the unknown (unseen$/$novel classes)
online; (2) Grouping and labeling these unknown as novel known classes; (3)
Incremental learning (IL), i.e., continual learning these novel classes and
retaining the memory of old classes. Ideally, all of these steps should be
automated. However, existing methods mostly assume that the second task is
completely done manually. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenGCD that combines
three key ideas to solve the above problems sequentially: (a) We score the
origin of instances (unknown or specifically known) based on the uncertainty of
the classifier's prediction; (b) For the first time, we introduce generalized
category discovery (GCD) techniques in OWR to assist humans in grouping
unlabeled data; (c) For the smooth execution of IL and GCD, we retain an equal
number of informative exemplars for each class with diversity as the goal.
Moreover, we present a new performance evaluation metric for GCD called
harmonic clustering accuracy. Experiments on two standard classification
benchmarks and a challenging dataset demonstrate that OpenGCD not only offers
excellent compatibility but also substantially outperforms other baselines.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present GraspFlow, a refinement approach for generating
context-specific grasps. We formulate the problem of grasp synthesis as a
sampling problem: we seek to sample from a context-conditioned probability
distribution of successful grasps. However, this target distribution is
unknown. As a solution, we devise a discriminator gradient-flow method to
evolve grasps obtained from a simpler distribution in a manner that mimics
sampling from the desired target distribution. Unlike existing approaches,
GraspFlow is modular, allowing grasps that satisfy multiple criteria to be
obtained simply by incorporating the relevant discriminators. It is also simple
to implement, requiring minimal code given existing auto-differentiation
libraries and suitable discriminators. Experiments show that GraspFlow
generates stable and executable grasps on a real-world Panda robot for a
diverse range of objects. In particular, in 60 trials on 20 different household
objects, the first attempted grasp was successful 94% of the time, and 100%
grasp success was achieved by the second grasp. Moreover, incorporating a
functional discriminator for robot-human handover improved the functional
aspect of the grasp by up to 33%.

<p class="mathjax">Our research group wanted to take on the difficult task of predicting prices
in a dynamic market. And short term rentals such as Airbnb listings seemed to
be the perfect proving ground to do such a thing. Airbnb has revolutionized the
travel industry by providing a platform for homeowners to rent out their
properties to travelers. The pricing of Airbnb rentals is prone to high
fluctuations, with prices changing frequently based on demand, seasonality, and
other factors. Accurate prediction of Airbnb rental prices is crucial for hosts
to optimize their revenue and for travelers to make informed booking decisions.
In this project, we aim to predict the prices of Airbnb rentals using a machine
learning modeling approach.
<br />Our project expands on earlier research in the area of analyzing Airbnb
rental prices by taking a methodical machine learning approach as well as
incorporating sentiment analysis into our feature engineering. We intend to
gain a deeper understanding on periodic changes of Airbnb rental prices. The
primary objective of this study is to construct an accurate machine learning
model for predicting Airbnb rental prices specifically in Austin, Texas. Our
project's secondary objective is to identify the key factors that drive Airbnb
rental prices and to investigate how these factors vary across different
locations and property types.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, significant achievements have been made in motion planning
for intelligent vehicles. However, as a typical unstructured environment,
open-pit mining attracts limited attention due to its complex operational
conditions and adverse environmental factors. A comprehensive paradigm for
unmanned transportation in open-pit mines is proposed in this research,
including a simulation platform, a testing benchmark, and a trustworthy and
robust motion planner. \textcolor{red}{Firstly, we propose a multi-task motion
planning algorithm, called FusionPlanner, for autonomous mining trucks by the
Multi-sensor fusion method to adapt both lateral and longitudinal control tasks
for unmanned transportation. Then, we develop a novel benchmark called
MiningNav, which offers three validation approaches to evaluate the
trustworthiness and robustness of well-trained algorithms in transportation
roads of open-pit mines. Finally, we introduce the Parallel Mining Simulator
(PMS), a new high-fidelity simulator specifically designed for open-pit mining
scenarios. PMS enables the users to manage and control open-pit mine
transportation from both the single-truck control and multi-truck scheduling
perspectives.} \textcolor{red}{The performance of FusionPlanner is tested by
MiningNav in PMS, and the empirical results demonstrate a significant reduction
in the number of collisions and takeovers of our planner. We anticipate our
unmanned transportation paradigm will bring mining trucks one step closer to
trustworthiness and robustness in continuous round-the-clock unmanned
transportation.

<p class="mathjax">Securing critical assets in a bus-based System-On-Chip (SoC) is imperative to
mitigate potential vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access, ensuring
the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the system. Ensuring
security throughout the SoC design process is a formidable task owing to the
inherent intricacies in SoC designs and the dispersion of assets across diverse
IPs. Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT (OpenAI) and BARD
(Google), have showcased remarkable proficiency across various domains,
including security vulnerability detection and prevention in SoC designs. In
this work, we propose DIVAS, a novel framework that leverages the knowledge
base of LLMs to identify security vulnerabilities from user-defined SoC
specifications, map them to the relevant Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs),
followed by the generation of equivalent assertions, and employ security
measures through enforcement of security policies. The proposed framework is
implemented using multiple ChatGPT and BARD models, and their performance was
analyzed while generating relevant CWEs from the SoC specifications provided.
The experimental results obtained from open-source SoC benchmarks demonstrate
the efficacy of our proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is characterized by rapid, irregular heartbeats, and
can lead to fatal complications such as heart failure. The disease is divided
into two sub-types based on severity, which can be automatically classified
through CT volumes for disease screening of severe cases. However, existing
classification approaches rely on generic radiomic features that may not be
optimal for the task, whilst deep learning methods tend to over-fit to the
high-dimensional volume inputs. In this work, we propose a novel
radiomics-informed deep-learning method, RIDL, that combines the advantages of
deep learning and radiomic approaches to improve AF sub-type classification.
Unlike existing hybrid techniques that mostly rely on na\"ive feature
concatenation, we observe that radiomic feature selection methods can serve as
an information prior, and propose supplementing low-level deep neural network
(DNN) features with locally computed radiomic features. This reduces DNN
over-fitting and allows local variations between radiomic features to be better
captured. Furthermore, we ensure complementary information is learned by deep
and radiomic features by designing a novel feature de-correlation loss.
Combined, our method addresses the limitations of deep learning and radiomic
approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art radiomic, deep learning, and hybrid
approaches, achieving 86.9% AUC for the AF sub-type classification task. Code
is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/RIDL.

guiding vector field under a homotopy equivalence transformation. Firstly, the
derivation of a guiding vector field, based on a non-singular vector field, is
elaborated to navigate a transformed path from another frame. The existence of
such vector fields is also deliberated herein. Subsequently, a coordination
vector field derived from the guiding vector field is presented, incorporating
an in-depth analysis concerning the impact of the vector field parameters.
Lastly, the practical implementation of this novel vector field is demonstrated
by its applications to 2-D and 3-D cooperative moving path following issues,

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel frequency-domain approach for path following
problem, specifically designed to handle paths described by discrete data. The
proposed algorithm utilizes the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to process the
discrete path data, enabling the construction of a non-singular guiding vector
field. This vector field serves as a reference direction for the controlled
robot, offering the ability to adapt to different levels of precision.
Additionally, the frequency-domain nature of the vector field allows for the
reduction of computational complexity and effective noise suppression. The
efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a numerical
simulation, and theoretical analysis provides an upper bound for the ultimate
mean-square path-following error.

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops low-dimensional moment methods for advective problems on
networks of domains. The evolution of a density function is described by a
linear advection-diffusion-reaction equation on each domain, combined via
advective flux coupling across domains in the network graph. The PDEs'
coefficients vary in time and across domains but they are fixed along each
domain. As a result, the solution on each domain is frequently close to a
Gaussian that moves, decays, and widens. For that reason, this work studies
moment methods that track only three degrees of freedom per domain -- in
contrast to traditional PDE discretization methods that tend to require many
more variables per domain. A simple ODE-based moment method is developed, as
well as an asymptotic-preserving scheme. We apply the methodology to an
application that models the life cycle of forest pests that undergo different
life stages and developmental pathways. The model is calibrated for the spotted
lanternfly, an invasive species present in the Eastern USA. We showcase that
the moment method, despite its significant low-dimensionality, can successfully
reproduce the prediction of the pest's establishment potential, compared to
much higher-dimensional computational approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we conceptualize the learning process as information
compression. We seek to equip generative pre-trained models with human-like
learning capabilities that enable data compression during inference. We present
a novel approach that utilizes the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to
approximate Kolmogorov complexity, with the aim of estimating the optimal
Information Distance for few-shot learning. We first propose using GPT as a
prior for lossless text compression, achieving a noteworthy compression ratio.
Experiment with LLAMA2-7B backbone achieves a compression ratio of 15.5 on
enwik9. We justify the pre-training objective of GPT models by demonstrating
its equivalence to the compression length, and, consequently, its ability to
approximate the information distance for texts. Leveraging the approximated
information distance, our method allows the direct application of GPT models in
quantitative text similarity measurements. Experiment results show that our
method overall achieves superior performance compared to embedding and prompt
baselines on challenging NLP tasks, including semantic similarity, zero and
one-shot text classification, and zero-shot text ranking.

<p class="mathjax">Lip-based biometric authentication (LBBA) is an authentication method based
on a person's lip movements during speech in the form of video data captured by
a camera sensor. LBBA can utilize both physical and behavioral characteristics
of lip movements without requiring any additional sensory equipment apart from
an RGB camera. State-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches use one-shot learning to
train deep siamese neural networks which produce an embedding vector out of
these features. Embeddings are further used to compute the similarity between
an enrolled user and a user being authenticated. A flaw of these approaches is
that they model behavioral features as style-of-speech without relation to what
is being said. This makes the system vulnerable to video replay attacks of the
client speaking any phrase. To solve this problem we propose a one-shot
approach which models behavioral features to discriminate against what is being
said in addition to style-of-speech. We achieve this by customizing the GRID
dataset to obtain required triplets and training a siamese neural network based
on 3D convolutions and recurrent neural network layers. A custom triplet loss
for batch-wise hard-negative mining is proposed. Obtained results using an
open-set protocol are 3.2% FAR and 3.8% FRR on the test set of the customized
GRID dataset. Additional analysis of the results was done to quantify the
influence and discriminatory power of behavioral and physical features for
LBBA.

<p class="mathjax">Aerial-to-ground image synthesis is an emerging and challenging problem that
aims to synthesize a ground image from an aerial image. Due to the highly
different layout and object representation between the aerial and ground
images, existing approaches usually fail to transfer the components of the
aerial scene into the ground scene. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
to explore the challenges by imposing enhanced structural alignment and
semantic awareness. We introduce a novel semantic-attentive feature
transformation module that allows to reconstruct the complex geographic
structures by aligning the aerial feature to the ground layout. Furthermore, we
propose semantic-aware loss functions by leveraging a pre-trained segmentation
network. The network is enforced to synthesize realistic objects across various
classes by separately calculating losses for different classes and balancing
them. Extensive experiments including comparisons with previous methods and
ablation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed framework both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Recent DETR-based video grounding models have made the model directly predict
moment timestamps without any hand-crafted components, such as a pre-defined
proposal or non-maximum suppression, by learning moment queries. However, their
input-agnostic moment queries inevitably overlook an intrinsic temporal
structure of a video, providing limited positional information. In this paper,
we formulate an event-aware dynamic moment query to enable the model to take
the input-specific content and positional information of the video into
account. To this end, we present two levels of reasoning: 1) Event reasoning
that captures distinctive event units constituting a given video using a slot
attention mechanism; and 2) moment reasoning that fuses the moment queries with
a given sentence through a gated fusion transformer layer and learns
interactions between the moment queries and video-sentence representations to
predict moment timestamps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of the event-aware dynamic moment queries, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches on several video grounding benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">The exponential growth of data, alongside advancements in model structures
and loss functions, has necessitated the enhancement of image retrieval systems
through the utilization of new models with superior feature embeddings.
However, the expensive process of updating the old retrieval database by
replacing embeddings poses a challenge. As a solution, backward-compatible
training can be employed to avoid the necessity of updating old retrieval
datasets. While previous methods achieved backward compatibility by aligning
prototypes of the old model, they often overlooked the distribution of the old
features, thus limiting their effectiveness when the old model's low quality
leads to a weakly discriminative feature distribution. On the other hand,
instance-based methods like L2 regression take into account the distribution of
old features but impose strong constraints on the performance of the new model
itself. In this paper, we propose MixBCT, a simple yet highly effective
backward-compatible training method that serves as a unified framework for old
models of varying qualities. Specifically, we summarize four constraints that
are essential for ensuring backward compatibility in an ideal scenario, and we
construct a single loss function to facilitate backward-compatible training.
Our approach adaptively adjusts the constraint domain for new features based on
the distribution of the old embeddings. We conducted extensive experiments on
the large-scale face recognition datasets MS1Mv3 and IJB-C to verify the
effectiveness of our method. The experimental results clearly demonstrate its
superiority over previous methods. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">In real-world datasets, noisy labels are pervasive. The challenge of learning
with noisy labels (LNL) is to train a classifier that discerns the actual
classes from given instances. For this, the model must identify features
indicative of the authentic labels. While research indicates that genuine label
information is embedded in the learned features of even inaccurately labeled
data, it's often intertwined with noise, complicating its direct application.
Addressing this, we introduce channel-wise contrastive learning (CWCL). This
method distinguishes authentic label information from noise by undertaking
contrastive learning across diverse channels. Unlike conventional instance-wise
contrastive learning (IWCL), CWCL tends to yield more nuanced and resilient
features aligned with the authentic labels. Our strategy is twofold: firstly,
using CWCL to extract pertinent features to identify cleanly labeled samples,
and secondly, progressively fine-tuning using these samples. Evaluations on
several benchmark datasets validate our method's superiority over existing
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-grained, span-level human evaluation has emerged as a reliable and
robust method for evaluating text generation tasks such as summarization,
simplification, machine translation and news generation, and the derived
annotations have been useful for training automatic metrics and improving
language models. However, existing annotation tools implemented for these
evaluation frameworks lack the adaptability to be extended to different domains
or languages, or modify annotation settings according to user needs. And the
absence of a unified annotated data format inhibits the research in multi-task
learning. In this paper, we introduce Thresh, a unified, customizable and
deployable platform for fine-grained evaluation. By simply creating a YAML
configuration file, users can build and test an annotation interface for any
framework within minutes -- all in one web browser window. To facilitate
collaboration and sharing, Thresh provides a community hub that hosts a
collection of fine-grained frameworks and corresponding annotations made and
collected by the community, covering a wide range of NLP tasks. For deployment,
Thresh offers multiple options for any scale of annotation projects from small
manual inspections to large crowdsourcing ones. Additionally, we introduce a
Python library to streamline the entire process from typology design and
deployment to annotation processing. Thresh is publicly accessible at
https://thresh.tools.

<p class="mathjax">Utilizing a two-stage paradigm comprising of coarse image retrieval and
precise reranking, a well-established image retrieval system is formed. It has
been widely accepted for long time that local feature is imperative to the
subsequent stage - reranking, but this requires sizeable storage and computing
capacities. We, for the first time, propose an image retrieval paradigm
leveraging global feature only to enable accurate and lightweight image
retrieval for both coarse retrieval and reranking, thus the name - SuperGlobal.
It consists of several plug-in modules that can be easily integrated into an
already trained model, for both coarse retrieval and reranking stage. This
series of approaches is inspired by the investigation into Generalized Mean
(GeM) Pooling. Possessing these tools, we strive to defy the notion that local
feature is essential for a high-performance image retrieval paradigm. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements compared to the state of the
art in standard benchmarks. Notably, on the Revisited Oxford (ROxford)+1M Hard
dataset, our single-stage results improve by 8.2% absolute, while our two-stage
version gain reaches 3.7% with a strong 7568X speedup. Furthermore, when the
full SuperGlobal is compared with the current single-stage state-of-the-art
method, we achieve roughly 17% improvement with a minimal 0.005% time overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Filecoin is the largest storage-based open-source blockchain, both by storage
capacity (&gt;11EiB) and market capitalization. This paper provides the first
formal security analysis of Filecoin's consensus (ordering) protocol, Expected
Consensus (EC). Specifically, we show that EC is secure against an arbitrary
adversary that controls a fraction $\beta$ of the total storage for $\beta m&lt;
1- e^{-(1-\beta)m}$, where $m$ is a parameter that corresponds to the expected
number of blocks per round, currently $m=5$ in Filecoin. We then present an
attack, the $n$-split attack, where an adversary splits the honest miners
between multiple chains, and show that it is successful for $\beta m \ge 1-
e^{-(1-\beta)m}$, thus proving that $\beta m= 1- e^{-(1-\beta)m}$ is the tight
security threshold of EC. This corresponds roughly to an adversary with $20\%$
of the total storage pledged to the chain. Finally, we propose two improvements
to EC security that would increase this threshold. One of these two fixes is
being implemented as a Filecoin Improvement Proposal (FIP).

The key issue is to make each "larger-created-from-smaller" synthesis

that needs to be solved--and the size of each search space--has roughly the

<p class="mathjax">In the early commercialization stage of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs),
reasonable hydrogen supply infrastructure (HSI) planning decisions is a premise
for promoting the popularization of HFCVs. However, there is a strong causality
between HFCVs and hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs): the planning decisions of
HRSs could affect the hydrogen refueling demand of HFCVs, and the growth of
demand would in turn stimulate the further investment in HRSs, which is also
known as the ``chicken and egg'' conundrum. Meanwhile, the hydrogen demand is
uncertain with insufficient prior knowledge, and thus there is a
decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) in the planning issue. This poses great
challenges to solving the optimization problem. To this end, this work
establishes a multi-network HSI planning model coordinating hydrogen, power,
and transportation networks. Then, to reflect the causal relationship between
HFCVs and HRSs effectively without sufficient historical data, a
distributionally robust optimization framework with decision-dependent
uncertainty is developed. The uncertainty of hydrogen demand is modeled as a
Wasserstein ambiguity set with a decision-dependent empirical probability
distribution. Subsequently, to reduce the computational complexity caused by
the introduction of a large number of scenarios and high-dimensional nonlinear
constraints, we developed an improved distribution shaping method and
techniques of scenario and variable reduction to derive the solvable form with
less computing burden. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that this
method can reduce costs by at least 10.4% compared with traditional methods and
will be more effective in large-scale HSI planning issues. Further, we put
forward effective suggestions for the policymakers and investors to formulate
relevant policies and decisions.

of effective disease prevention. However, decision models for allocating
preventive care are lacking.
<br />Methodology/Results. In this paper, we develop a data-driven decision model
for determining a cost-effective allocation of preventive treatments to
patients at risk. Specifically, we combine counterfactual inference, machine
learning, and optimization techniques to build a scalable decision model that
can exploit high-dimensional medical data, such as the data found in modern
electronic health records. Our decision model is evaluated based on electronic
health records from 89,191 prediabetic patients. We compare the allocation of
preventive treatments (metformin) prescribed by our data-driven decision model
with that of current practice. We find that if our approach is applied to the
U.S. population, it can yield annual savings of $1.1 billion. Finally, we
analyze the cost-effectiveness under varying budget levels.
<br />Managerial Implications. Our work supports decision-making in health
management, with the goal of achieving effective disease prevention at lower
costs. Importantly, our decision model is generic and can thus be used for
effective allocation of preventive care for other preventable diseases.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown its unprecedented success
in many graph-related tasks. However, GNNs face the label scarcity issue as
other neural networks do. Thus, recent efforts try to pre-train GNNs on a
large-scale unlabeled graph and adapt the knowledge from the unlabeled graph to
the target downstream task. The adaptation is generally achieved by fine-tuning
the pre-trained GNNs with a limited number of labeled data. Despite the
importance of fine-tuning, current GNNs pre-training works often ignore
designing a good fine-tuning strategy to better leverage transferred knowledge
and improve the performance on downstream tasks. Only few works start to
investigate a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs. But their
designs either have strong assumptions or overlook the data-aware issue for
various downstream datasets. Therefore, we aim to design a better fine-tuning
strategy for pre-trained GNNs to improve the model performance in this paper.
Given a pre-trained GNN, we propose to search to fine-tune pre-trained graph
neural networks for graph-level tasks (S2PGNN), which adaptively design a
suitable fine-tuning framework for the given labeled data on the downstream
task. To ensure the improvement brought by searching fine-tuning strategy, we
carefully summarize a proper search space of fine-tuning framework that is
suitable for GNNs. The empirical studies show that S2PGNN can be implemented on
the top of 10 famous pre-trained GNNs and consistently improve their
performance. Besides, S2PGNN achieves better performance than existing
fine-tuning strategies within and outside the GNN area. Our code is publicly

<p class="mathjax">The reconstruction of object surfaces from multi-view images or monocular
video is a fundamental issue in computer vision. However, much of the recent
research concentrates on reconstructing geometry through implicit or explicit
methods. In this paper, we shift our focus towards reconstructing mesh in
conjunction with color. We remove the view-dependent color from neural volume
rendering while retaining volume rendering performance through a relighting
network. Mesh is extracted from the signed distance function (SDF) network for
the surface, and color for each surface vertex is drawn from the global color
network. To evaluate our approach, we conceived a in hand object scanning task
featuring numerous occlusions and dramatic shifts in lighting conditions. We've
gathered several videos for this task, and the results surpass those of any
existing methods capable of reconstructing mesh alongside color. Additionally,
our method's performance was assessed using public datasets, including DTU,
BlendedMVS, and OmniObject3D. The results indicated that our method performs
well across all these datasets. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">In the domain of streaming recommender systems, conventional methods for
addressing new user IDs or item IDs typically involve assigning initial ID
embeddings randomly. However, this practice results in two practical
challenges: (i) Items or users with limited interactive data may yield
suboptimal prediction performance. (ii) Embedding new IDs or low-frequency IDs
necessitates consistently expanding the embedding table, leading to unnecessary
memory consumption. In light of these concerns, we introduce a reinforcement
learning-driven framework, namely AutoAssign+, that facilitates Automatic
Shared Embedding Assignment Plus. To be specific, AutoAssign+ utilizes an
Identity Agent as an actor network, which plays a dual role: (i) Representing
low-frequency IDs field-wise with a small set of shared embeddings to enhance
the embedding initialization, and (ii) Dynamically determining which ID
features should be retained or eliminated in the embedding table. The policy of
the agent is optimized with the guidance of a critic network. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive experiments on three
commonly used benchmark datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that
AutoAssign+ is capable of significantly enhancing recommendation performance by
mitigating the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our framework yields a
reduction in memory usage of approximately 20-30%, verifying its practical
effectiveness and efficiency for streaming recommender systems.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, instruction-following Large Language Models (LLMs) , represented by
ChatGPT, have exhibited exceptional performance in general Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. However, the unique characteristics of E-commerce data
pose significant challenges to general LLMs. An LLM tailored specifically for
E-commerce scenarios, possessing robust cross-dataset/task generalization
capabilities, is a pressing necessity. To solve this issue, in this work, we
proposed the first e-commerce instruction dataset EcomInstruct, with a total of
2.5 million instruction data. EcomInstruct scales up the data size and task
diversity by constructing atomic tasks with E-commerce basic data types, such
as product information, user reviews. Atomic tasks are defined as intermediate
tasks implicitly involved in solving a final task, which we also call
Chain-of-Task tasks. We developed EcomGPT with different parameter scales by
training the backbone model BLOOMZ with the EcomInstruct. Benefiting from the
fundamental semantic understanding capabilities acquired from the Chain-of-Task
tasks, EcomGPT exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization capabilities.
Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that EcomGPT
outperforms ChatGPT in term of cross-dataset/task generalization on E-commerce
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Proof competence, i.e. the ability to write and check (mathematical) proofs,
is an important skill in Computer Science, but for many students it represents
a difficult challenge. The main issues are the correct use of formal language
and the ascertainment of whether proofs, especially the students' own, are
complete and correct. Many authors have suggested using proof assistants to
assist in teaching proof competence, but the efficacy of the approach is
unclear. To improve the state of affairs, we introduce ProofBuddy: a web-based
tool using the Isabelle proof assistant which enables researchers to conduct
studies of the efficacy of approaches to using proof assistants in education by
collecting fine-grained data about the way students interact with proof

<p class="mathjax">The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is popular these years due to its
various applications. In the UAV network, routing is significantly affected by
the distributed network topology, leading to the issue that UAVs are vulnerable
to deliberate damage. Hence, this paper focuses on the routing plan and
recovery for UAV networks with attacks. In detail, a deliberate attack model
based on the importance of nodes is designed to represent enemy attacks. Then,
a node importance ranking mechanism is presented, considering the degree of
nodes and link importance. However, it is intractable to handle the routing
problem by traditional methods for UAV networks, since link connections change
with the UAV availability. Hence, an intelligent algorithm based on
reinforcement learning is proposed to recover the routing path when UAVs are
attacked. Simulations are conducted and numerical results verify the proposed
mechanism performs better than other referred methods.

<p class="mathjax">3D object reconstruction and multilevel segmentation are fundamental to
computer vision research. Existing algorithms usually perform 3D scene
reconstruction and target objects segmentation independently, and the
performance is not fully guaranteed due to the challenge of the 3D
segmentation. Here we propose an open-source one stop 3D target reconstruction
and multilevel segmentation framework (OSTRA), which performs segmentation on
2D images, tracks multiple instances with segmentation labels in the image
sequence, and then reconstructs labelled 3D objects or multiple parts with
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) or RGBD-based 3D reconstruction methods. We extend
object tracking and 3D reconstruction algorithms to support continuous
segmentation labels to leverage the advances in the 2D image segmentation,
especially the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) which uses the pretrained neural
network without additional training for new scenes, for 3D object segmentation.
OSTRA supports most popular 3D object models including point cloud, mesh and
voxel, and achieves high performance for semantic segmentation, instance
segmentation and part segmentation on several 3D datasets. It even surpasses
the manual segmentation in scenes with complex structures and occlusions. Our
method opens up a new avenue for reconstructing 3D targets embedded with rich
multi-scale segmentation information in complex scenes. OSTRA is available from
https://github.com/ganlab/OSTRA.

approach to unsupervised text simplification which infuses KG-established
techniques in order to construct a simplified KG path and generate a concise

sampling KG-first approach, our model is capable of simplifying text when
starting from a KG by learning to keep important information while harnessing
KG-to-text generation to output fluent and descriptive sentences. We evaluate

<p class="mathjax">Reranking plays a crucial role in modern multi-stage recommender systems by
rearranging the initial ranking list to model interplay between items.
Considering the inherent challenges of reranking such as combinatorial
searching space, some previous studies have adopted the evaluator-generator
paradigm, with a generator producing feasible sequences and a evaluator
selecting the best one based on estimated listwise utility. Inspired by the
remarkable success of diffusion generative models, this paper explores the
potential of diffusion models for generating high-quality sequences in
reranking. However, we argue that it is nontrivial to take diffusion models as
the generator in the context of recommendation. Firstly, diffusion models
primarily operate in continuous data space, differing from the discrete data
space of item permutations. Secondly, the recommendation task is different from
conventional generation tasks as the purpose of recommender systems is to
fulfill user interests. Lastly, real-life recommender systems require
efficiency, posing challenges for the inference of diffusion models. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Discrete Conditional Diffusion
Reranking (DCDR) framework for recommendation. DCDR extends traditional
diffusion models by introducing a discrete forward process with tractable
posteriors, which adds noise to item sequences through step-wise discrete
operations (e.g., swapping). Additionally, DCDR incorporates a conditional
reverse process that generates item sequences conditioned on expected user
responses. Extensive offline experiments conducted on public datasets
demonstrate that DCDR outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods.
Furthermore, DCDR has been deployed in a real-world video app with over 300
million daily active users, significantly enhancing online recommendation
quality.

<p class="mathjax">Nearest neighbor (NN) sampling provides more semantic variations than
pre-defined transformations for self-supervised learning (SSL) based image
recognition problems. However, its performance is restricted by the quality of
the support set, which holds positive samples for the contrastive loss. In this
work, we show that the quality of the support set plays a crucial role in any
nearest neighbor based method for SSL. We then provide a refined baseline
(pNNCLR) to the nearest neighbor based SSL approach (NNCLR). To this end, we
introduce pseudo nearest neighbors (pNN) to control the quality of the support
set, wherein, rather than sampling the nearest neighbors, we sample in the
vicinity of hard nearest neighbors by varying the magnitude of the resultant
vector and employing a stochastic sampling strategy to improve the performance.
Additionally, to stabilize the effects of uncertainty in NN-based learning, we
employ a smooth-weight-update approach for training the proposed network.
Evaluation of the proposed method on multiple public image recognition and
medical image recognition datasets shows that it performs up to 8 percent
better than the baseline nearest neighbor method, and is comparable to other
previously proposed SSL methods.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately detecting objects in the environment is a key challenge for
autonomous vehicles. However, obtaining annotated data for detection is
expensive and time-consuming. We introduce PatchContrast, a novel
self-supervised point cloud pre-training framework for 3D object detection. We
propose to utilize two levels of abstraction to learn discriminative
representation from unlabeled data: proposal-level and patch-level. The
proposal-level aims at localizing objects in relation to their surroundings,
whereas the patch-level adds information about the internal connections between
the object's components, hence distinguishing between different objects based
on their individual components. We demonstrate how these levels can be
integrated into self-supervised pre-training for various backbones to enhance
the downstream 3D detection task. We show that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models on three commonly-used 3D detection datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Computing the discrete rational minimax approximation in the complex plane is
challenging. Apart from Ruttan's sufficient condition, there are few other
sufficient conditions for global optimality. The state-of-the-art rational
approximation algorithms, such as the adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA),
AAA-Lawson, and the rational Krylov fitting (RKFIT) method, perform highly
efficiently, but the computed rational approximants may be near-best. In this
paper, we propose a convex programming approach, the solution of which is
guaranteed to be the rational minimax approximation under Ruttan's sufficient
condition. Furthermore, we present a new version of Lawson's iteration for
solving this convex programming problem. The computed solution can be easily
verified as the rational minimax approximant. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate that this updated version of Lawson's iteration generally converges
monotonically with respect to the objective function of the convex programming.
It is an effective competitive approach for the rational minimax problem,
compared to the highly efficient AAA, AAA-Lawson, and the stabilized
Sanathanan-Koerner iteration.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-stage architectures have exhibited efficacy in image dehazing, which
usually decomposes a challenging task into multiple more tractable sub-tasks
and progressively estimates latent hazy-free images. Despite the remarkable
progress, existing methods still suffer from the following shortcomings: (1)
limited exploration of frequency domain information; (2) insufficient
information interaction; (3) severe feature redundancy. To remedy these issues,
we propose a novel Mutual Information-driven Triple interaction Network
(MITNet) based on spatial-frequency dual domain information and two-stage
architecture. To be specific, the first stage, named amplitude-guided haze
removal, aims to recover the amplitude spectrum of the hazy images for haze
removal. And the second stage, named phase-guided structure refined, devotes to
learning the transformation and refinement of the phase spectrum. To facilitate
the information exchange between two stages, an Adaptive Triple Interaction
Module (ATIM) is developed to simultaneously aggregate cross-domain,
cross-scale, and cross-stage features, where the fused features are further
used to generate content-adaptive dynamic filters so that applying them to
enhance global context representation. In addition, we impose the mutual
information minimization constraint on paired scale encoder and decoder
features from both stages. Such an operation can effectively reduce information
redundancy and enhance cross-stage feature complementarity. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets exhibit that our MITNet performs
superior performance with lower model complexity.The code and models are
available at https://github.com/it-hao/MITNet.

<p class="mathjax">Online academic profiles are used by scholars to reflect a desired image to
their online audience. In Google Scholar, scholars can select a subset of
co-authors for presentation in a central location on their profile using a
social feature called the Co-authroship panel. In this work, we examine whether
scientometrics and reciprocality can explain the observed selections. To this
end, we scrape and thoroughly analyze a novel set of 120,000 Google Scholar
profiles, ranging across four disciplines and various academic institutions.
Our results suggest that scholars tend to favor co-authors with higher
scientometrics over others for inclusion in their co-authorship panels.
Interestingly, as one's own scientometrics are higher, the tendency to include
co-authors with high scientometrics is diminishing. Furthermore, we find that
reciprocality is central to explaining scholars' selections.

<p class="mathjax">Knapsack is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer
science. In the $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation setting, although there is a
fine-grained lower bound of $(n + 1 / \epsilon) ^ {2 - o(1)}$ based on the
$(\min, +)$-convolution hypothesis ([K{\"u}nnemann, Paturi and Stefan
Schneider, ICALP 2017] and [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki and Wlodarczyk, 2017]), the
best algorithm is randomized and runs in $\tilde O(n + (1 / \epsilon) ^
{11/5})$ time [Deng, Jin and Mao, SODA 2023], and it remains an important open
problem whether an algorithm with a running time that matches the lower bound
(up to a sub-polynomial factor) exists. We answer the problem positively by
showing a deterministic $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation scheme for knapsack that
runs in $\tilde O(n + (1 / \epsilon) ^ {2})$ time. We first extend a known
lemma in a recursive way to reduce the problem to $n \epsilon$-additve
approximation for $n$ items. Then we give a simple efficient geometry-based
algorithm for the reduced problem.

<p class="mathjax">The operation of creating edges has been widely applied to optimize relevant
quantities of opinion dynamics. In this paper, we consider a problem of
polarization optimization for the leader-follower opinion dynamics in a noisy
social network with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, where a group $Q$ of $q$ nodes are
leaders, and the remaining $n-q$ nodes are followers. We adopt the popular
leader-follower DeGroot model, where the opinion of every leader is identical
and remains unchanged, while the opinion of every follower is subject to white
noise. The polarization is defined as the steady-state variance of the
deviation of each node's opinion from leaders' opinion, which equals one half
of the effective resistance $\mathcal{R}_Q$ between the node group $Q$ and all
other nodes. Concretely, we propose and study the problem of minimizing
$\mathcal{R}_Q$ by adding $k$ new edges with each incident to a node in $Q$. We
show that the objective function is monotone and supermodular. We then propose
a simple greedy algorithm with an approximation factor $1-1/e$ that
approximately solves the problem in $O((n-q)^3)$ time. To speed up the
computation, we also provide a fast algorithm to compute
$(1-1/e-\eps)$-approximate effective resistance $\mathcal{R}_Q$, the running
time of which is $\Otil (mk\eps^{-2})$ for any $\eps&gt;0$, where the $\Otil
(\cdot)$ notation suppresses the ${\rm poly} (\log n)$ factors. Extensive
experiment results show that our second algorithm is both effective and
efficient.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial camouflage has garnered attention for its ability to attack
object detectors from any viewpoint by covering the entire object's surface.
However, universality and robustness in existing methods often fall short as
the transferability aspect is often overlooked, thus restricting their
application only to a specific target with limited performance. To address
these challenges, we present Adversarial Camouflage for Transferable and
Intensive Vehicle Evasion (ACTIVE), a state-of-the-art physical camouflage
attack framework designed to generate universal and robust adversarial
camouflage capable of concealing any 3D vehicle from detectors. Our framework
incorporates innovative techniques to enhance universality and robustness: a
refined texture rendering that enables common texture application to different
vehicles without being constrained to a specific texture map, a novel stealth
loss that renders the vehicle undetectable, and a smooth and camouflage loss to
enhance the naturalness of the adversarial camouflage. Our extensive
experiments on 15 different models show that ACTIVE consistently outperforms
existing works on various public detectors, including the latest YOLOv7.
Notably, our universality evaluations reveal promising transferability to other
vehicle classes, tasks (segmentation models), and the real world, not just
other vehicles.

<p class="mathjax">LSM-trees are widely adopted as the storage backend of key-value stores.
However, optimizing the system performance under dynamic workloads has not been
sufficiently studied or evaluated in previous work. To fill the gap, we present
RusKey, a key-value store with the following new features: (1) RusKey is a
first attempt to orchestrate LSM-tree structures online to enable robust
performance under the context of dynamic workloads; (2) RusKey is the first
study to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to guide LSM-tree transformations; (3)
RusKey includes a new LSM-tree design, named FLSM-tree, for an efficient
transition between different compaction policies -- the bottleneck of dynamic
key-value stores. We justify the superiority of the new design with theoretical
analysis; (4) RusKey requires no prior workload knowledge for system
adjustment, in contrast to state-of-the-art techniques. Experiments show that
RusKey exhibits strong performance robustness in diverse workloads, achieving
up to 4x better end-to-end performance than the RocksDB system under various
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral imagery contains abundant spectral information beyond the
visible RGB bands, providing rich discriminative details about objects in a
scene. Leveraging such data has the potential to enhance visual tracking
performance. While prior hyperspectral trackers employ CNN or hybrid
CNN-Transformer architectures, we propose a novel approach HPFormer on
Transformers to capitalize on their powerful representation learning
capabilities. The core of HPFormer is a Hyperspectral Hybrid Attention (HHA)
module which unifies feature extraction and fusion within one component through
token interactions. Additionally, a Transform Band Module (TBM) is introduced
to selectively aggregate spatial details and spectral signatures from the full
hyperspectral input for injecting informative target representations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of HPFormer on benchmark
NIR and VIS tracking datasets. Our work provides new insights into harnessing
the strengths of transformers and hyperspectral fusion to advance robust object

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) method based
on contrastive bi-projector (CBP), which can improve the existing UDA methods.
It is called CBPUDA here, which effectively promotes the feature extractors
(FEs) to reduce the generation of ambiguous features for classification and
domain adaption. The CBP differs from traditional bi-classifier-based methods
at that these two classifiers are replaced with two projectors of performing a
mapping from the input feature to two distinct features. These two projectors
and the FEs in the CBPUDA can be trained adversarially to obtain more refined
decision boundaries so that it can possess powerful classification performance.
Two properties of the proposed loss function are analyzed here. The first
property is to derive an upper bound of joint prediction entropy, which is used
to form the proposed loss function, contrastive discrepancy (CD) loss. The CD
loss takes the advantages of the contrastive learning and the bi-classifier.
The second property is to analyze the gradient of the CD loss and then overcome
the drawback of the CD loss. The result of the second property is utilized in
the development of the gradient scaling (GS) scheme in this paper. The GS
scheme can be exploited to tackle the unstable problem of the CD loss because
training the CBPUDA requires using contrastive learning and adversarial
learning at the same time. Therefore, using the CD loss with the GS scheme
overcomes the problem mentioned above to make features more compact for
intra-class and distinguishable for inter-class. Experimental results express
that the CBPUDA is superior to conventional UDA methods under consideration in
this paper for UDA and fine-grained UDA tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Fingerprint recognition on mobile devices is an important method for identity
verification. However, real fingerprints usually contain sweat and moisture
which leads to poor recognition performance. In addition, for rolling out
slimmer and thinner phones, technology companies reduce the size of recognition
sensors by embedding them with the power button. Therefore, the limited size of
fingerprint data also increases the difficulty of recognition. Denoising the
small-area wet fingerprint images to clean ones becomes crucial to improve
recognition performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable
progressive guided multi-task neural network (PGT-Net). The PGT-Net includes a
shared stage and specific multi-task stages, enabling the network to train
binary and non-binary fingerprints sequentially. The binary information is
regarded as guidance for output enhancement which is enriched with the ridge
and valley details. Moreover, a novel residual scaling mechanism is introduced
to stabilize the training process. Experiment results on the FW9395 and
FT-lightnoised dataset provided by FocalTech shows that PGT-Net has promising
performance on the wet-fingerprint denoising and significantly improves the
fingerprint recognition rate (FRR). On the FT-lightnoised dataset, the FRR of
fingerprint recognition can be declined from 17.75% to 4.47%. On the FW9395
dataset, the FRR of fingerprint recognition can be declined from 9.45% to
1.09%.

<p class="mathjax">The SOTIF standard (ISO 21448) requires scenario-based testing to verify and
validate Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Automated Driving Systems but
does not suggest any practical way to do so effectively and efficiently.
Existing scenario generation approaches either focus on exploring or exploiting
the scenario space. This generally leads to test suites that cover many known
cases but potentially miss edge cases or focused test suites that are effective
but also contain less diverse scenarios. To generate SOTIF-compliant test
suites that achieve higher coverage and find more faults, this paper proposes
semi-concrete scenarios and combines them with parameter sampling to adequately
balance scenario space exploration and exploitation. Semi-concrete scenarios
enable combinatorial scenario generation techniques that systematically explore
the scenario space, while parameter sampling allows for the exploitation of
continuous parameters. Our experimental results show that the proposed concept
can generate more effective test suites than state-of-the-art coverage-based
sampling. Moreover, our results show that including a feedback mechanism to
drive parameter sampling further increases test suites' effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal contrastive learning aims to train a general-purpose feature
extractor, such as CLIP, on vast amounts of raw, unlabeled paired image-text
data. This can greatly benefit various complex downstream tasks, including
cross-modal image-text retrieval and image classification. Despite its
promising prospect, the security issue of cross-modal pre-trained encoder has
not been fully explored yet, especially when the pre-trained encoder is
publicly available for commercial use.
<br />In this work, we propose AdvCLIP, the first attack framework for generating
downstream-agnostic adversarial examples based on cross-modal pre-trained
encoders. AdvCLIP aims to construct a universal adversarial patch for a set of
natural images that can fool all the downstream tasks inheriting the victim
cross-modal pre-trained encoder. To address the challenges of heterogeneity
between different modalities and unknown downstream tasks, we first build a
topological graph structure to capture the relevant positions between target
samples and their neighbors. Then, we design a topology-deviation based
generative adversarial network to generate a universal adversarial patch. By
adding the patch to images, we minimize their embeddings similarity to
different modality and perturb the sample distribution in the feature space,
achieving unviersal non-targeted attacks. Our results demonstrate the excellent
attack performance of AdvCLIP on two types of downstream tasks across eight
datasets. We also tailor three popular defenses to mitigate AdvCLIP,
highlighting the need for new defense mechanisms to defend cross-modal
pre-trained encoders.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the spatial bandwidth for line-of-sight (LOS)
channels with linear large-scale antenna arrays (LSAAs) in 3D space. We provide
approximations to the spatial bandwidth at the center of the receiving array,
of the form $C R^{-B}$, where $R$ is the radial distance, and $C$ and $B$ are
directional-dependent and piecewise constant in $R$. The approximations are
valid in the entire radiative region, that is, for $R$ greater than a few
wavelengths. When the length of the receiving array is small relative to $R$,
the product of the array length and the spatial bandwidth provides an estimate
of the available spatial degree-of-freedom (DOF) in the channel. In a case
study, we apply these approximations to the evaluation of spatial multiplexing
regions under random orientation conditions. The goodness-of-fit of the
approximations is demonstrated and some interesting findings about the DOF
performance of the channel under 3D and 2D orientation restrictions are
obtained, e.g., that, under some conditions, it is better to constrain the
receiving array orientation to be uniform over the unit circle in the 2D ground
plane rather than uniform over the 3D unit sphere.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown great success in rendering
novel-view images of a given scene by learning an implicit representation with
only posed RGB images. NeRF and relevant neural field methods (e.g., neural
surface representation) typically optimize a point-wise loss and make
point-wise predictions, where one data point corresponds to one pixel.
Unfortunately, this line of research failed to use the collective supervision
of distant pixels, although it is known that pixels in an image or scene can
provide rich structural information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to design a nonlocal multiplex training paradigm for NeRF and relevant
neural field methods via a novel Stochastic Structural SIMilarity (S3IM) loss
that processes multiple data points as a whole set instead of process multiple
inputs independently. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the unreasonable
effectiveness of S3IM in improving NeRF and neural surface representation for
nearly free. The improvements of quality metrics can be particularly
significant for those relatively difficult tasks: e.g., the test MSE loss
unexpectedly drops by more than 90% for TensoRF and DVGO over eight novel view
synthesis tasks; a 198% F-score gain and a 64% Chamfer $L_{1}$ distance
reduction for NeuS over eight surface reconstruction tasks. Moreover, S3IM is
consistently robust even with sparse inputs, corrupted images, and dynamic
scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Rank-order coding, a form of temporal coding, has emerged as a promising
scheme to explain the rapid ability of the mammalian brain. Owing to its speed
as well as efficiency, rank-order coding is increasingly gaining interest in
diverse research areas beyond neuroscience. However, much uncertainty still
exists about the performance of rank-order coding under noise. Herein we show
what information rates are fundamentally possible and what trade-offs are at
stake. An unexpected finding in this paper is the emergence of a special class
of errors that, in a regime, increase with less noise.

<p class="mathjax">The use of numerical based multi-phase fluid flow simulation can
significantly aid in the development of an effective remediation strategy for
groundwater systems contaminated with Dense Non Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL).
Incorporating the lithological heterogeneities of the aquifer into the model
domain is a crucial aspect in the development of robust numerical simulators.
Previous research studies have attempted to incorporate lithological
heterogeneities into the domain; however, most of these numerical simulators
are based on Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM)
which have limited applicability in the field-scale aquifers. Finite Element
Method (FEM) can be highly useful in developing the field-scale simulation of
DNAPL infiltration due to its consistent accuracy on irregular study domain,
and the availability of higher orders of basis functions.
<br />In this research work, FEM based model has been developed to simulate the
DNAPL infiltration in a hypothetical field-scale aquifer. The model results
demonstrate the effect of meso-scale heterogeneities, specifically clay lenses,
on the migration and accumulation of Dense Non Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL)
within the aquifer. Furthermore, this research provides valuable insights for
the development of an appropriate remediation strategy for a general
contaminated aquifer.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs), a new class of
generative model in which the parameters of a set of independent distributions
are modified with Bayesian inference in the light of noisy data samples, then
passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent
distribution. Starting from a simple prior and iteratively updating the two
distributions yields a generative procedure similar to the reverse process of
diffusion models; however it is conceptually simpler in that no forward process
is required. Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for
continuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation
procedures. Notably, the network inputs for discrete data lie on the
probability simplex, and are therefore natively differentiable, paving the way
for gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains
such as language modelling. The loss function directly optimises data
compression and places no restrictions on the network architecture. In our
experiments BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modelling on
dynamically binarized MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform all known discrete
diffusion models on the text8 character-level language modelling task.

<p class="mathjax">The quantification of cognitive powers rests on identifying a behavioural
task that depends on them. Such dependence cannot be assured, for the powers a
task invokes cannot be experimentally controlled or constrained a priori,
resulting in unknown vulnerability to failure of specificity and
generalisability. Evaluating a compact version of Raven's Advanced Progressive
Matrices (RAPM), a widely used clinical test of fluid intelligence, we show
that LaMa, a self-supervised artificial neural network trained solely on the
completion of partially masked images of natural environmental scenes, achieves
human-level test scores a prima vista, without any task-specific inductive bias
or training. Compared with cohorts of healthy and focally lesioned
participants, LaMa exhibits human-like variation with item difficulty, and
produces errors characteristic of right frontal lobe damage under degradation
of its ability to integrate global spatial patterns. LaMa's narrow training and
limited capacity -- comparable to the nervous system of the fruit fly --
suggest RAPM may be open to computationally simple solutions that need not
necessarily invoke abstract reasoning.

<p class="mathjax">Label Distribution Learning (LDL) assigns soft labels, a.k.a. degrees, to a
sample. In reality, it is always laborious to obtain complete degrees, giving
birth to the Incomplete LDL (InLDL). However, InLDL often suffers from
performance degeneration. To remedy it, existing methods need one or more
explicit regularizations, leading to burdensome parameter tuning and extra
computation. We argue that label distribution itself may provide useful prior,
when used appropriately, the InLDL problem can be solved without any explicit
regularization. In this paper, we offer a rational alternative to use such a
prior. Our intuition is that large degrees are likely to get more concern, the
small ones are easily overlooked, whereas the missing degrees are completely
neglected in InLDL. To learn an accurate label distribution, it is crucial not
to ignore the small observed degrees but to give them properly large weights,
while gradually increasing the weights of the missing degrees. To this end, we
first define a weighted empirical risk and derive upper bounds between the
expected risk and the weighted empirical risk, which reveals in principle that
weighting plays an implicit regularization role. Then, by using the prior of
degrees, we design a weighted scheme and verify its effectiveness. To sum up,
our model has four advantages, it is 1) model selection free, as no explicit
regularization is imposed; 2) with closed form solution (sub-problem) and
easy-to-implement (a few lines of codes); 3) with linear computational
complexity in the number of samples, thus scalable to large datasets; 4)
competitive with state-of-the-arts even without any explicit regularization.

While most collaborative filtering models rely on statistical computations on a
large scale of interaction data between users and items and can achieve high
performance, they often lack clear explanatory power. We propose UIPC-MF, a
prototype-based matrix factorization method for explainable collaborative
filtering recommendations. In UIPC-MF, both users and items are associated with
sets of prototypes, capturing general collaborative attributes. To enhance
explainability, UIPC-MF learns connection weights that reflect the associative

outperforms other prototype-based baseline methods in terms of Hit Ratio and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain on three datasets, while also providing
better transparency.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing popularity of compact and inexpensive cameras, e.g.~dash
cameras, body cameras, and cameras equipped on robots, has sparked a growing
interest in detecting anomalies within dynamic scenes recorded by moving
cameras. However, existing reviews primarily concentrate on Video Anomaly
Detection (VAD) methods assuming static cameras. The VAD literature with moving
cameras remains fragmented, lacking comprehensive reviews to date. To address
this gap, we endeavor to present the first comprehensive survey on Moving
Camera Video Anomaly Detection (MC-VAD). We delve into the research papers
related to MC-VAD, critically assessing their limitations and highlighting
associated challenges. Our exploration encompasses three application domains:
security, urban transportation, and marine environments, which in turn cover
six specific tasks. We compile an extensive list of 25 publicly-available
datasets spanning four distinct environments: underwater, water surface,
ground, and aerial. We summarize the types of anomalies these datasets
correspond to or contain, and present five main categories of approaches for
detecting such anomalies. Lastly, we identify future research directions and
discuss novel contributions that could advance the field of MC-VAD. With this
survey, we aim to offer a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners
striving to develop and advance state-of-the-art MC-VAD methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning methods are emerging as popular computational tools for solving
forward and inverse problems in traffic flow. In this paper, we study a neural
operator framework for learning solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic partial
differential equations with applications in macroscopic traffic flow models. In
this framework, an operator is trained to map heterogeneous and sparse traffic
input data to the complete macroscopic traffic state in a supervised learning
setting. We chose a physics-informed Fourier neural operator ($\pi$-FNO) as the
operator, where an additional physics loss based on a discrete conservation law
regularizes the problem during training to improve the shock predictions. We
also propose to use training data generated from random piecewise constant
input data to systematically capture the shock and rarefied solutions. From
experiments using the LWR traffic flow model, we found superior accuracy in
predicting the density dynamics of a ring-road network and urban signalized
road. We also found that the operator can be trained using simple traffic
density dynamics, e.g., consisting of $2-3$ vehicle queues and $1-2$ traffic
signal cycles, and it can predict density dynamics for heterogeneous vehicle
queue distributions and multiple traffic signal cycles $(\geq 2)$ with an
acceptable error. The extrapolation error grew sub-linearly with input
complexity for a proper choice of the model architecture and training data.
Adding a physics regularizer aided in learning long-term traffic density
dynamics, especially for problems with periodic boundary data.

<p class="mathjax">The morbidity of scalp diseases is minuscule compared to other diseases, but
the impact on the patient's life is enormous. It is common for people to
experience scalp problems that include Dandruff, Psoriasis, Tinea-Capitis,
Alopecia and Atopic-Dermatitis. In accordance with WHO research, approximately
70% of adults have problems with their scalp. It has been demonstrated in
descriptive research that hair quality is impaired by impaired scalp, but these
impacts are reversible with early diagnosis and treatment. Deep Learning
advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN paired with FCN in
diagnosing scalp and skin disorders. In one proposed Deep-Learning-based scalp
inspection and diagnosis system, an imaging microscope and a trained model are
combined with an app that classifies scalp disorders accurately with an average
precision of 97.41%- 99.09%. Another research dealt with classifying the
Psoriasis using the CNN with an accuracy of 82.9%. As part of another study, an
ML based algorithm was also employed. It accurately classified the healthy
scalp and alopecia areata with 91.4% and 88.9% accuracy with SVM and KNN
algorithms. Using deep learning models to diagnose scalp related diseases has
improved due to advancements i computation capabilities and computer vision,
but there remains a wide horizon for further improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as Cooperative Intelligent Transport
Systems (C-ITS) are increasingly defined by the software which operates these
systems. In practice, microservice architectures can be employed, which may
consist of containerized microservices running in a cluster comprised of robots
and supporting infrastructure. These microservices need to be orchestrated
dynamically according to ever changing requirements posed at the system.
Additionally, these systems are embedded in DevOps processes aiming at
continually updating and upgrading both the capabilities of CPS components and
of the system as a whole. In this paper, we present RobotKube, an approach to
orchestrating containerized microservices for large-scale cooperative
multi-robot CPS based on Kubernetes. We describe how to automate the
orchestration of software across a CPS, and include the possibility to monitor
and selectively store relevant accruing data. In this context, we present two
main components of such a system: an event detector capable of, e.g.,
requesting the deployment of additional applications, and an application
manager capable of automatically configuring the required changes in the
Kubernetes cluster. By combining the widely adopted Kubernetes platform with
the Robot Operating System (ROS), we enable the use of standard tools and
practices for developing, deploying, scaling, and monitoring microservices in
C-ITS. We demonstrate and evaluate RobotKube in an exemplary and reproducible
use case that we make publicly available at
https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/robotkube .

<p class="mathjax">Sequences of repeated gambles provide an experimental tool to characterize
the risk preferences of humans or artificial decision-making agents. The
difficulty of this inference depends on factors including the details of the
gambles offered and the number of iterations of the game played. In this paper
we explore in detail the practical challenges of inferring risk preferences
from the observed choices of artificial agents who are presented with finite
sequences of repeated gambles. We are motivated by the fact that the strategy
to maximize long-run wealth for sequences of repeated additive gambles (where
gains and losses are independent of current wealth) is different to the
strategy for repeated multiplicative gambles (where gains and losses are
proportional to current wealth.) Accurate measurement of risk preferences would
be needed to tell whether an agent is employing the optimal strategy or not. To
generalize the types of gambles our agents face we use the Yeo-Johnson
transformation, a tool borrowed from feature engineering for time series
analysis, to construct a family of gambles that interpolates smoothly between
the additive and multiplicative cases. We then analyze the optimal strategy for
this family, both analytically and numerically. We find that it becomes
increasingly difficult to distinguish the risk preferences of agents as their
wealth increases. This is because agents with different risk preferences
eventually make the same decisions for sufficiently high wealth. We believe
that these findings are informative for the effective design of experiments to
measure risk preferences in humans.

<p class="mathjax">Offensive security-tests are a common way to pro-actively discover potential
vulnerabilities. They are performed by specialists, often called
penetration-testers or white-hat hackers. The chronic lack of available
white-hat hackers prevents sufficient security test coverage of software.
Research into automation tries to alleviate this problem by improving the
efficiency of security testing. To achieve this, researchers and tool builders
need a solid understanding of how hackers work, their assumptions, and pain
points.
<br />In this paper, we present a first data-driven exploratory qualitative study
of twelve security professionals, their work and problems occurring therein. We
perform a thematic analysis to gain insights into the execution of security
assignments, hackers' thought processes and encountered challenges.
<br />This analysis allows us to conclude with recommendations for researchers and
tool builders to increase the efficiency of their automation and identify novel
areas for research.

<p class="mathjax">We discuss an extension of the scalar auxiliary variable approach which was
originally introduced by Shen et al.~([Shen, Xu, Yang, J.~Comput.~Phys., 2018])
for the discretization of deterministic gradient flows. By introducing an
additional scalar auxiliary variable, this approach allows to derive a linear
scheme, while still maintaining unconditional stability. Our extension augments
the approximation of the evolution of this scalar auxiliary variable with
higher order terms, which enables its application to stochastic partial
differential equations. Using the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation as a
prototype for nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations with
multiplicative noise, we propose an unconditionally energy stable, linear,
fully discrete finite element scheme based on our stochastic scalar auxiliary
variable method. Recovering a discrete version of the energy estimate and
establishing Nikolskii estimates with respect to time, we are able to prove
convergence of appropriate subsequences of discrete solutions towards pathwise
unique martingale solutions by applying Jakubowski's generalization of
Skorokhod's theorem. A generalization of the Gy\"ongy--Krylov characterization
of convergence in probability to quasi-Polish spaces finally provides
convergence of fully discrete solutions towards strong solutions of the
stochastic Allen--Cahn equation.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models may inadvertently memorize sensitive, unauthorized,
or malicious data, posing risks of privacy violations, security breaches, and
performance deterioration. To address these issues, machine unlearning has
emerged as a critical technique to selectively remove specific training data
points' influence on trained models. This paper provides a comprehensive
taxonomy and analysis of machine unlearning research. We categorize existing
research into exact unlearning that algorithmically removes data influence
entirely and approximate unlearning that efficiently minimizes influence
through limited parameter updates. By reviewing the state-of-the-art solutions,
we critically discuss their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
future directions to advance machine unlearning and establish it as an
essential capability for trustworthy and adaptive machine learning. This paper
provides researchers with a roadmap of open problems, encouraging impactful
contributions to address real-world needs for selective data removal.

<p class="mathjax">Ridge surfaces represent important features for the analysis of 3-dimensional
(3D) datasets in diverse applications and are often derived from varying
underlying data including flow fields, geological fault data, and point data,
but they can also be present in the original scalar images acquired using a
plethora of imaging techniques. Our work is motivated by the analysis of image
data acquired using micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) of ancient, rolled and
folded thin-layer structures such as papyrus, parchment, and paper as well as
silver and lead sheets. From these documents we know that they are
2-dimensional (2D) in nature. Hence, we are particularly interested in
reconstructing 2D manifolds that approximate the document's structure. The
image data from which we want to reconstruct the 2D manifolds are often very
noisy and represent folded, densely-layered structures with many artifacts,
such as ruptures or layer splitting and merging. Previous ridge-surface
extraction methods fail to extract the desired 2D manifold for such challenging
data. We have therefore developed a novel method to extract 2D manifolds. The
proposed method uses a local fast marching scheme in combination with a
separation of the region covered by fast marching into two sub-regions. The 2D
manifold of interest is then extracted as the surface separating the two
sub-regions. The local scheme can be applied for both automatic propagation as
well as interactive analysis. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness
of our method on both artificial data as well as real-world data including
folded silver and papyrus sheets.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-robot systems have become very popular in recent years because of their
wide spectrum of applications, ranging from surveillance to cooperative payload
transportation. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising controller for
multi-robot control because of its preview capability and ability to handle
constraints easily. The performance of the MPC widely depends on many
parameters, among which the prediction horizon is the major contributor.
Increasing the prediction horizon beyond a limit drastically increases the
computation cost. Tuning the value of the prediction horizon can be very
time-consuming, and the tuning process must be repeated for every task.
Moreover, instead of using a fixed horizon for an entire task, a better balance
between performance and computation cost can be established if different
prediction horizons can be employed for every robot at each time step. Further,
for such variable prediction horizon MPC for multiple robots, on-demand
collision avoidance is the key requirement. We propose Versatile On-demand
Collision Avoidance (VODCA) strategy to comply with the variable horizon model
predictive control. We also present a framework for learning the prediction
horizon for the multi-robot system as a function of the states of the robots
using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithm. The results are illustrated and
validated numerically for different multi-robot tasks.

<p class="mathjax">This study attempts to segment teeth and root-canals simultaneously from CBCT
images, but there are very challenging problems in this process. First, the
clinical CBCT image data is very large (e.g., 672 *688 * 688), and the use of
downsampling operation will lose useful information about teeth and root
canals. Second, teeth and root canals are very different in morphology, and it
is difficult for a simple network to identify them precisely. In addition,
there are weak edges at the tooth, between tooth and root canal, which makes it
very difficult to segment such weak edges. To this end, we propose a
coarse-to-fine segmentation method based on inverse feature fusion transformer
and uncertainty estimation to address above challenging problems. First, we use
the downscaled volume data (e.g., 128 * 128 * 128) to conduct coarse
segmentation and map it to the original volume to obtain the area of teeth and
root canals. Then, we design a transformer with reverse feature fusion, which
can bring better segmentation effect of different morphological objects by
transferring deeper features to shallow features. Finally, we design an
auxiliary branch to calculate and refine the difficult areas in order to
improve the weak edge segmentation performance of teeth and root canals.
Through the combined tooth and root canal segmentation experiment of 157
clinical high-resolution CBCT data, it is verified that the proposed method is
superior to the existing tooth or root canal segmentation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation language models obtain the instruction-following ability through
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Diversity and complexity are considered critical
factors of a successful SFT dataset, while their definitions remain obscure and
lack quantitative analyses. In this work, we propose InsTag, an open-set
fine-grained tagger, to tag samples within SFT datasets based on semantics and
intentions and define instruction diversity and complexity regarding tags. We
obtain 6.6K tags to describe comprehensive user queries. Then we analyze
popular open-sourced SFT datasets and find that the model ability grows with
more diverse and complex data. Based on this observation, we propose a data
selector based on InsTag to select 6K diverse and complex samples from
open-source datasets and fine-tune models on InsTag-selected data. The
resulting models, TagLM, outperform open-source models based on considerably
larger SFT data evaluated by MT-Bench, echoing the importance of query
diversity and complexity. We open-source InsTag in

<p class="mathjax">Modern supervised semantic segmentation methods are usually finetuned based
on the supervised or self-supervised models pre-trained on ImageNet. Recent
work shows that transferring the knowledge from CLIP to semantic segmentation
via prompt learning can achieve promising performance. The performance boost
comes from the feature enhancement with multimodal alignment, i.e., the dot
product between vision and text embeddings. However, how to improve the
multimodal alignment for better transfer performance in dense tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we focus on improving the quality of vision-text
alignment from two aspects of prompting design and loss function, and present
an instance-conditioned prompting with contrastive learning (ICPC) framework.
First, compared with the static prompt designs, we reveal that dynamic
prompting conditioned on image content can more efficiently utilize the text
encoder for complex dense tasks. Second, we propose an align-guided contrastive
loss to refine the alignment of vision and text embeddings. We further propose
lightweight multi-scale alignment for better performance. Extensive experiments
on three large-scale datasets (ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10k, and ADE20K-Full)
demonstrate that ICPC brings consistent improvements across diverse backbones.
Taking ResNet-50 as an example, ICPC outperforms the state-of-the-art
counterpart by 1.71%, 1.05%, and 1.41% mIoU on the three datasets,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Sanskrit poetry has played a significant role in shaping the literary and
cultural landscape of the Indian subcontinent for centuries. However, not much
attention has been devoted to uncovering the hidden beauty of Sanskrit poetry
in computational linguistics. This article explores the intersection of
Sanskrit poetry and computational linguistics by proposing a roadmap of an
interpretable framework to analyze and classify the qualities and
characteristics of fine Sanskrit poetry. We discuss the rich tradition of
Sanskrit poetry and the significance of computational linguistics in
automatically identifying the characteristics of fine poetry. The proposed
framework involves a human-in-the-loop approach that combines deterministic
aspects delegated to machines and deep semantics left to human experts. We
provide a deep analysis of Siksastaka, a Sanskrit poem, from the perspective of
6 prominent kavyashastra schools, to illustrate the proposed framework.
Additionally, we provide compound, dependency, anvaya (prose order linearised
form), meter, rasa (mood), alankar (figure of speech), and riti (writing style)
annotations for Siksastaka and a web application to illustrate the poem's
analysis and annotations. Our key contributions include the proposed framework,
the analysis of Siksastaka, the annotations and the web application for future
research. Link for interactive analysis:

<p class="mathjax">Log parsing, which extracts log templates from semi-structured logs and
produces structured logs, is the first and the most critical step in automated
log analysis. While existing log parsers have achieved decent results, they
suffer from two major limitations by design. First, they do not natively
support hybrid logs that consist of both single-line logs and multi-line logs
(\eg Java Exception and Hadoop Counters). Second, they fall short in
integrating domain knowledge in parsing, making it hard to identify ambiguous
tokens in logs. This paper defines a new research problem, \textit{hybrid log
parsing}, as a superset of traditional log parsing tasks, and proposes
\textit{Hue}, the first attempt for hybrid log parsing via a user-adaptive
manner. Specifically, Hue converts each log message to a sequence of special
wildcards using a key casting table and determines the log types via line
aggregating and pattern extracting. In addition, Hue can effectively utilize
user feedback via a novel merge-reject strategy, making it possible to quickly
adapt to complex and changing log templates. We evaluated Hue on three hybrid
log datasets and sixteen widely-used single-line log datasets (\ie Loghub). The
results show that Hue achieves an average grouping accuracy of 0.845 on hybrid
logs, which largely outperforms the best results (0.563 on average) obtained by
existing parsers. Hue also exhibits SOTA performance on single-line log
datasets. Furthermore, Hue has been successfully deployed in a real production
environment for daily hybrid log parsing.

<p class="mathjax">We consider linear first-order systems of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) in port-Hamiltonian (pH) form. Physical parameters are remodelled as
random variables to conduct an uncertainty quantification. A stochastic
Galerkin projection yields a larger deterministic system of ODEs, which does
not exhibit a pH form in general. We apply transformations of the original
systems such that the stochastic Galerkin projection becomes
structure-preserving. Furthermore, we investigate meaning and properties of the
Hamiltonian function belonging to the stochastic Galerkin system. A large
number of random variables implies a highdimensional stochastic Galerkin
system, which suggests itself to apply model order reduction (MOR) generating a
low-dimensional system of ODEs. We discuss structure preservation in
projection-based MOR, where the smaller systems of ODEs feature pH form again.
Results of numerical computations are presented using two test examples.

<p class="mathjax">In 3D human action recognition, limited supervised data makes it challenging
to fully tap into the modeling potential of powerful networks such as
transformers. As a result, researchers have been actively investigating
effective self-supervised pre-training strategies. In this work, we show that
instead of following the prevalent pretext task to perform masked
self-component reconstruction in human joints, explicit contextual motion
modeling is key to the success of learning effective feature representation for
3D action recognition. Formally, we propose the Masked Motion Prediction (MAMP)
framework. To be specific, the proposed MAMP takes as input the masked
spatio-temporal skeleton sequence and predicts the corresponding temporal
motion of the masked human joints. Considering the high temporal redundancy of
the skeleton sequence, in our MAMP, the motion information also acts as an
empirical semantic richness prior that guide the masking process, promoting
better attention to semantically rich temporal regions. Extensive experiments
on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that the proposed MAMP
pre-training substantially improves the performance of the adopted vanilla
transformer, achieving state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles. The
source code of our MAMP is available at https://github.com/maoyunyao/MAMP.

protocol. The Dutta-Barua group key agreement is used to agree upon a shared
symmetric key among subscribers and publishers on a topic. By using a shared

authentication codes (MACs) per message compared to existing proposals for
secure brokerless Publish/Subscribe protocols, which establish a symmetric key
between each publisher and subscriber and append multiple MACs to each message.

<p class="mathjax">The adoption of cloud computing has brought significant advancements in the
operational models of businesses. However, this shift also brings new security
challenges by expanding the attack surface. The offered services in cloud
computing have various service models. Each cloud service model has a defined
responsibility divided based on the stack layers between the service user and
their cloud provider. Regardless of its service model, each service is
constructed from sub-components and services running on the underlying layers.
In this paper, we aim to enable more transparency and visibility by designing
an ontology that links the provider's services with the sub-components used to
deliver the service. Such breakdown for each cloud service sub-components
enables the end user to track the vulnerabilities on the service level or one
of its sub-components. Such information can result in a better understanding
and management of reported vulnerabilities on the sub-components level and
their impact on the offered services by the cloud provider. Our ontology and
source code are published as an open-source and accessible via GitHub:

<p class="mathjax">We consider the following problem about dispersing points. Given a set of
points in the plane, the task is to identify whether by moving a small number
of points by small distance, we can obtain an arrangement of points such that
no pair of points is ``close" to each other. More precisely, for a family of
$n$ points, an integer $k$, and a real number $d &gt; 0$, we ask whether at most
$k$ points could be relocated, each point at distance at most $d$ from its
original location, such that the distance between each pair of points is at
least a fixed constant, say $1$. A number of approximation algorithms for
variants of this problem, under different names like distant representatives,
disk dispersing, or point spreading, are known in the literature. However, to
the best of our knowledge, the parameterized complexity of this problem remains
widely unexplored. We make the first step in this direction by providing a
kernelization algorithm that, in polynomial time, produces an equivalent
instance with $O(d^2k^3)$ points. As a byproduct of this result, we also design
a non-trivial fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for the problem,
parameterized by $k$ and $d$. Finally, we complement the result about
polynomial kernelization by showing a lower bound that rules out the existence
of a kernel whose size is polynomial in $k$ alone, unless $\mathsf{NP}
\subseteq \mathsf{coNP}/\text{poly}$.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims to tackle a novel task - Temporal Sentence Grounding in
Streaming Videos (TSGSV). The goal of TSGSV is to evaluate the relevance
between a video stream and a given sentence query. Unlike regular videos,
streaming videos are acquired continuously from a particular source, and are
always desired to be processed on-the-fly in many applications such as
surveillance and live-stream analysis. Thus, TSGSV is challenging since it
requires the model to infer without future frames and process long historical
frames effectively, which is untouched in the early methods. To specifically
address the above challenges, we propose two novel methods: (1) a TwinNet
structure that enables the model to learn about upcoming events; and (2) a
language-guided feature compressor that eliminates redundant visual frames and
reinforces the frames that are relevant to the query. We conduct extensive
experiments using ActivityNet Captions, TACoS, and MAD datasets. The results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. A systematic ablation
study also confirms their effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Key-point-based scene understanding is fundamental for autonomous driving
applications. At the same time, optical flow plays an important role in many
vision tasks. However, due to the implicit bias of equal attention on all
points, classic data-driven optical flow estimation methods yield less
satisfactory performance on key points, limiting their implementations in
key-point-critical safety-relevant scenarios. To address these issues, we
introduce a points-based modeling method that requires the model to learn
key-point-related priors explicitly. Based on the modeling method, we present
FocusFlow, a framework consisting of 1) a mix loss function combined with a
classic photometric loss function and our proposed Conditional Point Control
Loss (CPCL) function for diverse point-wise supervision; 2) a conditioned
controlling model which substitutes the conventional feature encoder by our
proposed Condition Control Encoder (CCE). CCE incorporates a Frame Feature
Encoder (FFE) that extracts features from frames, a Condition Feature Encoder
(CFE) that learns to control the feature extraction behavior of FFE from input
masks containing information of key points, and fusion modules that transfer
the controlling information between FFE and CFE. Our FocusFlow framework shows
outstanding performance with up to +44.5% precision improvement on various key
points such as ORB, SIFT, and even learning-based SiLK, along with exceptional
scalability for most existing data-driven optical flow methods like PWC-Net,
RAFT, and FlowFormer. Notably, FocusFlow yields competitive or superior
performances rivaling the original models on the whole frame. The source code
will be available at https://github.com/ZhonghuaYi/FocusFlow_official.

<p class="mathjax">Popular test oracles for the perception subsystem of driving automation
systems identify true-positive (TP), false-positive (FP), and false-negative
(FN) objects. Oracle transparency is needed for comparing test results and for
safety cases. To date, there exists a common notion of TPs, FPs, and FNs in the
field, but apparently no published way to comprehensively define their oracles.
Therefore, this paper provides a checklist of functional aspects and
implementation details that affect the oracle behavior. Besides labeling
policies of the test set, we cover fields of view, occlusion handling,
safety-relevant areas, matching criteria, temporal and probabilistic issues,
and further aspects. Even though our checklist can hardly be formalized, it can
help practitioners maximize the transparency of their oracles, which, in turn,
makes statements on object perception more reliable and comparable.

<p class="mathjax">As a primary means of information acquisition, information retrieval (IR)
systems, such as search engines, have integrated themselves into our daily
lives. These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering,
and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its
origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models.
While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and
semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face
challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of
contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution
requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse
retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as
language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the
emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has
revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language
understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities.
Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR
systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary
to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a
comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs
and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers,
rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions within
this expanding field.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a module, Spatial Cross-scale Convolution (SCSC), which
is verified to be effective in improving both CNNs and Transformers. Nowadays,
CNNs and Transformers have been successful in a variety of tasks. Especially
for Transformers, increasing works achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
computer vision community. Therefore, researchers start to explore the
mechanism of those architectures. Large receptive fields, sparse connections,
weight sharing, and dynamic weight have been considered keys to designing
effective base models. However, there are still some issues to be addressed:
large dense kernels and self-attention are inefficient, and large receptive
fields make it hard to capture local features. Inspired by the above analyses
and to solve the mentioned problems, in this paper, we design a general module
taking in these design keys to enhance both CNNs and Transformers. SCSC
introduces an efficient spatial cross-scale encoder and spatial embed module to
capture assorted features in one layer. On the face recognition task,
FaceResNet with SCSC can improve 2.7% with 68% fewer FLOPs and 79% fewer
parameters. On the ImageNet classification task, Swin Transformer with SCSC can
achieve even better performance with 22% fewer FLOPs, and ResNet with CSCS can
improve 5.3% with similar complexity. Furthermore, a traditional network (e.g.,
ResNet) embedded with SCSC can match Swin Transformer's performance.

<p class="mathjax">The inverse short-time Fourier transform network (iSTFTNet) has garnered
attention owing to its fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity speech synthesis.
It obtains these characteristics using a fast and lightweight 1D CNN as the
backbone and replacing some neural processes with iSTFT. Owing to the
difficulty of a 1D CNN to model high-dimensional spectrograms, the frequency
dimension is reduced via temporal upsampling. However, this strategy
compromises the potential to enhance the speed. Therefore, we propose
iSTFTNet2, an improved variant of iSTFTNet with a 1D-2D CNN that employs 1D and
2D CNNs to model temporal and spectrogram structures, respectively. We designed
a 2D CNN that performs frequency upsampling after conversion in a few-frequency
space. This design facilitates the modeling of high-dimensional spectrograms
without compromising the speed. The results demonstrated that iSTFTNet2 made
iSTFTNet faster and more lightweight with comparable speech quality. Audio
samples are available at

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of technologies, such as extended reality (XR), has
increased the demand for high-quality three-dimensional (3D) graphical
representations. Industrial 3D applications encompass computer-aided design
(CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), scanning, and robotics. However, current
methods employed for industrial 3D representations suffer from high
implementation costs and reliance on manual human input for accurate 3D
modeling. To address these challenges, neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have
emerged as a promising approach for learning 3D scene representations based on
provided training 2D images. Despite a growing interest in NeRFs, their
potential applications in various industrial subdomains are still unexplored.
In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive examination of NeRF industrial
applications while also providing direction for future research endeavors. We
also present a series of proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate the
potential of NeRFs in the industrial domain. These experiments include
NeRF-based video compression techniques and using NeRFs for 3D motion
estimation in the context of collision avoidance. In the video compression
experiment, our results show compression savings up to 48\% and 74\% for
resolutions of 1920x1080 and 300x168, respectively. The motion estimation
experiment used a 3D animation of a robotic arm to train Dynamic-NeRF (D-NeRF)
and achieved an average disparity map PSNR of 23 dB and an SSIM of 0.97. The
code for our experiments is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has achieved great success in video recognition, yet still
struggles to recognize novel actions when faced with only a few examples. To
tackle this challenge, few-shot action recognition methods have been proposed
to transfer knowledge from a source dataset to a novel target dataset with only
one or a few labeled videos. However, existing methods mainly focus on modeling
the temporal relations between the query and support videos while ignoring the
spatial relations. In this paper, we find that the spatial misalignment between
objects also occurs in videos, notably more common than the temporal
inconsistency. We are thus motivated to investigate the importance of spatial
relations and propose a more accurate few-shot action recognition method that
leverages both spatial and temporal information. Particularly, a novel Spatial
Alignment Cross Transformer (SA-CT) which learns to re-adjust the spatial
relations and incorporates the temporal information is contributed. Experiments
reveal that, even without using any temporal information, the performance of
SA-CT is comparable to temporal based methods on 3/4 benchmarks. To further
incorporate the temporal information, we propose a simple yet effective
Temporal Mixer module. The Temporal Mixer enhances the video representation and
improves the performance of the full SA-CT model, achieving very competitive
results. In this work, we also exploit large-scale pretrained models for
few-shot action recognition, providing useful insights for this research
direction.

combining self-supervised (SSL) and deep active learning (DAL). Leveraging
transformer models, we aim to bypass traditional spectrogram conversions,
enabling direct raw audio processing. ActiveBird2Vec is set to generate
high-quality bird sound representations through SSL, potentially accelerating
the assessment of environmental changes and decision-making processes for wind
farms. Additionally, we seek to utilize the wide variety of bird vocalizations
through DAL, reducing the reliance on extensively labeled datasets by human
experts. We plan to curate a comprehensive set of tasks through Huggingface
Datasets, enhancing future comparability and reproducibility of bioacoustic
research. A comparative analysis between various transformer models will be
conducted to evaluate their proficiency in bird sound recognition tasks. We aim
to accelerate the progression of avian bioacoustic research and contribute to
more effective conservation strategies.

between current research in egocentric vision and the ever-anticipated future,
where wearable computing, with outward facing cameras and digital overlays, is
expected to be integrated in our every day lives. To understand this gap, the
article starts by envisaging the future through character-based stories,
showcasing through examples the limitations of current technology. We then
provide a mapping between this future and previously defined research tasks.
For each task, we survey its seminal works, current state-of-the-art
methodologies and available datasets, then reflect on shortcomings that limit
its applicability to future research. Note that this survey focuses on software
models for egocentric vision, independent of any specific hardware. The paper
concludes with recommendations for areas of immediate explorations so as to
unlock our path to the future always-on, personalised and life-enhancing
egocentric vision.

to a total of 3 coding tasks (Code Repair, Code Explanation, Code Synthesis)
across 6 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, Rust). Our models,
OctoCoder and OctoGeeX, achieve the best performance across HumanEvalPack among

<p class="mathjax">Time-evolving data sets can often be arranged as a higher-order tensor with
one of the modes being the time mode. While tensor factorizations have been
successfully used to capture the underlying patterns in such higher-order data
sets, the temporal aspect is often ignored, allowing for the reordering of time
points. In recent studies, temporal regularizers are incorporated in the time
mode to tackle this issue. Nevertheless, existing approaches still do not allow
underlying patterns to change in time (e.g., spatial changes in the brain,
contextual changes in topics). In this paper, we propose temporal PARAFAC2
(tPARAFAC2): a PARAFAC2-based tensor factorization method with temporal
regularization to extract gradually evolving patterns from temporal data.
Through extensive experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that tPARAFAC2
can capture the underlying evolving patterns accurately performing better than
PARAFAC2 and coupled matrix factorization with temporal smoothness
regularization.

versatility requirements of schedulers deployed on the transport layer, we
propose a lightweight scheduler based on an Age of Information (AoI) function
built with the tight scalar upper bound of the remote estimation error. We show
that the proposed scheduler is indexable and sub-optimal. We derive an upper
and a lower bound of the proposed scheduler and give stability conditions for
estimation error. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to existing

the optimal at a much lower computation time.

<p class="mathjax">This research explores how different virtual work environments, differing in
the type and amount of elements they include, impact users' flow, performance,
emotional state, and preferences. Pre-study interviews were conducted to inform
the design of three VR work environments: the Dark Room, the Empty Room, and
the Furnished Room. Fifteen participants took part in a user study where they
engaged in a logic-based task simulating deep work while experiencing each
environment. The findings suggest that while objective performance measures did
not differ significantly, subjective experiences and perceptions varied across
the environments. Participants reported feeling less distracted and more
focused in the Dark Room and the Empty Room compared to the Furnished Room. The
Empty Room was associated with the highest levels of relaxation and calmness,
while the Furnished Room was perceived as visually appealing yet more
distracting. These findings highlight the variability of user preferences and
emphasise the importance of considering user comfort and well-being in the
design of virtual work environments. The study contributes to the better
understanding of virtual workspaces and provides insights for designing
environments that promote flow, productivity, and user well-being.

<p class="mathjax">An example of a time-invariant time-delay system that is uniformly globally
attractive and Lyapunov stable, hence forward complete, but whose reachability
sets from bounded initial conditions are not bounded over compact time
intervals is provided. This gives a negative answer to two current conjectures
by showing that (i) forward completeness is not equivalent to robust forward
completeness and (ii) global asymptotic stability is not equivalent to uniform
global asymptotic stability. In addition, a novel characterization of robust
forward completeness for usually encountered classes of time-delay systems is
provided. This characterization relates robust forward completeness of the
time-delay system with the forward completeness of an associated nondelayed
finite-dimensional system.

<p class="mathjax">The fast development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and applications has
led to vast data collection, potentially containing irrelevant, noisy, or
redundant features that degrade learning model performance. These collected
data can be processed on either end-user devices (clients) or edge/cloud
server. Feature construction is a pre-processing technique that can generate
discriminative features and reveal hidden relationships between original
features within a dataset, leading to improved performance and reduced
computational complexity of learning models. Moreover, the communication cost
between clients and edge/cloud server can be minimized in situations where a
dataset needs to be transmitted for further processing. In this paper, the
first federated feature construction (FFC) method called multimodal multiple
FFC (MMFFC) is proposed by using multimodal optimization and gravitational
search programming algorithm. This is a collaborative method for constructing
multiple high-level features without sharing clients' datasets to enhance the
trade-off between accuracy of the trained model and overall communication cost
of the system, while also reducing computational complexity of the learning
model. We analyze and compare the accuracy-cost trade-off of two scenarios,
namely, 1) MMFFC federated learning (FL), using vanilla FL with pre-processed
datasets on clients and 2) MMFFC centralized learning, transferring
pre-processed datasets to an edge server and using centralized learning model.
The results on three datasets for the first scenario and eight datasets for the
second one demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the size of datasets
for about 60\(\%\), thereby reducing communication cost and improving accuracy
of the learning models tested on almost all datasets.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a robust beamforming problem where large amount of downlink (DL)
channel state information (CSI) data available at a multiple antenna access
point (AP) is used to improve the link quality to a user equipment (UE) for
beyond-5G and 6G applications such as environment-specific initial access (IA)
or wireless power transfer (WPT). As the DL CSI available at the current
instant may be imperfect or outdated, we propose a novel scheme which utilizes
the (unknown) correlation between the antenna domain and physical domain to
localize the possible future UE positions from the historical CSI database.
Then, we develop a codebook design procedure to maximize the minimum sum
beamforming gain to that localized CSI neighborhood. We also incorporate a UE
specific parameter to enlarge the neighborhood to robustify the link further.
We adopt an indoor channel model to demonstrate the performance of our
solution, and benchmark against a usually optimal (but now sub-optimal due to
outdated CSI) maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and a subspace based method.We
numerically show that our algorithm outperforms the other methods by a large
margin. This shows that customized environment-specific solutions are important
to solve many future wireless applications, and we have paved the way to
develop further data-driven approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, such as ChatGPT,
has revolutionized various research fields in artificial intelligence.
Transformers-based large language models (LLMs) have gradually replaced CNNs
and RNNs to unify fields of computer vision and natural language processing.
Compared with the data that exists relatively independently such as images,
videos or texts, graph is a type of data that contains rich structural and
relational information. Meanwhile, natural language, as one of the most
expressive mediums, excels in describing complex structures. However, existing
work on incorporating graph learning problems into the generative language
modeling framework remains very limited. As the importance of language models
continues to grow, it becomes essential to explore whether LLMs can also
replace GNNs as the foundational model for graphs. In this paper, we propose
InstructGLM (Instruction-finetuned Graph Language Model), systematically design
highly scalable prompts based on natural language instructions, and use natural
language to describe the geometric structure and node features of the graph for
instruction tuning an LLMs to perform learning and inference on graphs in a
generative manner. Our method exceeds all competitive GNN baselines on
ogbn-arxiv, Cora and PubMed datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
our method and sheds light on generative language models replacing GNNs as the
foundation model for graph machine learning.

<p class="mathjax">In \cite{wang2023towards}, a dual-consistent dual-weighted residual-based
$h$-adaptive method has been proposed based on a Newton-GMG framework, towards
the accurate calculation of a given quantity of interest from Euler equations.
The performance of such a numerical method is satisfactory, i.e., the stable
convergence of the quantity of interest can be observed in all numerical
experiments. In this paper, we will focus on the efficiency issue to further
develop this method, since efficiency is vital for numerical methods in
practical applications such as the optimal design of the vehicle shape. Three
approaches are studied for addressing the efficiency issue, i.e., i). using
convolutional neural networks as a solver for dual equations, ii). designing an
automatic adjustment strategy for the tolerance in the $h$-adaptive process to
conduct the local refinement and/or coarsening of mesh grids, and iii).
introducing OpenMP, a shared memory parallelization technique, to accelerate
the module such as the solution reconstruction in the method. The feasibility
of each approach and numerical issues are discussed in depth, and significant
acceleration from those approaches in simulations can be observed clearly from
a number of numerical experiments. In convolutional neural networks, it is
worth mentioning that the dual consistency plays an important role to guarantee
the efficiency of the whole method and that unstructured meshes are employed in
all simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has shown impressive results on diverse
downstream tasks by offline training on large-scale datasets. Regarding the
growing nature of real-world data, such an offline training paradigm on
ever-expanding data is unsustainable, because models lack the continual
learning ability to accumulate knowledge constantly. However, most continual
learning studies are limited to uni-modal classification and existing
multi-modal datasets cannot simulate continual non-stationary data stream
scenarios. To support the study of Vision-Language Continual Pretraining
(VLCP), we first contribute a comprehensive and unified benchmark dataset P9D
which contains over one million product image-text pairs from 9 industries. The
data from each industry as an independent task supports continual learning and
conforms to the real-world long-tail nature to simulate pretraining on web
data. We comprehensively study the characteristics and challenges of VLCP, and
propose a new algorithm: Compatible momentum contrast with Topology
Preservation, dubbed CTP. The compatible momentum model absorbs the knowledge
of the current and previous-task models to flexibly update the modal feature.
Moreover, Topology Preservation transfers the knowledge of embedding across
tasks while preserving the flexibility of feature adjustment. The experimental
results demonstrate our method not only achieves superior performance compared
with other baselines but also does not bring an expensive training burden.
Dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/KevinLight831/CTP.

<p class="mathjax">Traditionally, peer-to-peer systems have relied on altruism and reciprocity.
Although incentive-based models have gained prominence in new-generation
peer-to-peer systems, it is essential to recognize the continued importance of
cooperative principles in achieving performance, fairness, and correctness. The
lack of this acknowledgment has paved the way for selfish peers to gain unfair
advantages in these systems. As such, we address the challenge of selfish peers
by devising a mechanism to reward sustained cooperation. Instead of relying on
global accountability mechanisms, we propose a protocol that naturally
aggregates local evaluations of cooperation. Traditional mechanisms are often
vulnerable to Sybil and misreporting attacks. However, our approach overcomes
these issues by limiting the benefits selfish peers can gain without incurring
any cost. The viability of our algorithm is proven with a deployment to 27,259
Internet users and a realistic simulation of a blockchain gossip protocol. We
show that our protocol sustains cooperation even in the presence of a majority
of selfish peers while incurring only negligible overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Cultural heritage applications and advanced machine learning models are
creating a fruitful synergy to provide effective and accessible ways of
interacting with artworks. Smart audio-guides, personalized art-related content
and gamification approaches are just a few examples of how technology can be
exploited to provide additional value to artists or exhibitions. Nonetheless,
from a machine learning point of view, the amount of available artistic data is
often not enough to train effective models. Off-the-shelf computer vision
modules can still be exploited to some extent, yet a severe domain shift is
present between art images and standard natural image datasets used to train
such models. As a result, this can lead to degraded performance. This paper
introduces a novel approach to address the challenges of limited annotated data
and domain shifts in the cultural heritage domain. By leveraging generative
vision-language models, we augment art datasets by generating diverse
variations of artworks conditioned on their captions. This augmentation
strategy enhances dataset diversity, bridging the gap between natural images
and artworks, and improving the alignment of visual cues with knowledge from
general-purpose datasets. The generated variations assist in training vision
and language models with a deeper understanding of artistic characteristics and
that are able to generate better captions with appropriate jargon.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate, robust, and real-time LiDAR-based odometry (LO) is imperative for
many applications like robot navigation, globally consistent 3D scene map
reconstruction, or safe motion-planning. Though LiDAR sensor is known for its
precise range measurement, the non-uniform and uncertain point sampling density
induce structural inconsistencies. Hence, existing supervised and unsupervised
point set registration methods fail to establish one-to-one matching
correspondences between LiDAR frames. We introduce a novel deep learning-based
real-time (approx. 35-40ms per frame) LO method that jointly learns accurate
frame-to-frame correspondences and model's predictive uncertainty (PU) as
evidence to safe-guard LO predictions. In this work, we propose (i) partial
optimal transportation of LiDAR feature descriptor for robust LO estimation,
(ii) joint learning of predictive uncertainty while learning odometry over
driving sequences, and (iii) demonstrate how PU can serve as evidence for
necessary pose-graph optimization when LO network is either under or over
confident. We evaluate our method on KITTI dataset and show competitive
performance, even superior generalization ability over recent state-of-the-art
approaches. Source codes are available.

<p class="mathjax">The historical research-funding model, based on the curiosity and academic
interests of researchers, is giving way to new strategic funding models that
seek to meet societal needs. We investigated the impact of this trend on health
research funded by the two leading funding bodies worldwide, i.e. the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, and the framework programs of
the European Union (EU). To this end, we performed a quantitative analysis of
the content of projects supported through programmatic funding by the EU and
NIH, in the period 2008-2014 and 2015-2020. We used machine learning for
classification of projects as basic biomedical research, or as more
implementation directed clinical therapeutic research, diagnostics research,
population research, or policy and management research. In addition, we
analyzed funding for major disease areas (cancer, cardio-metabolic and
infectious disease). We found that EU collaborative health research projects
clearly shifted towards more implementation research. In the US, the recently
implemented UM1 program has a similar profile with strong clinical therapeutic
research, while other NIH programs remain heavily oriented to basic biomedical
research. Funding for cancer research is present across all NIH and EU
programs, and in biomedical as well as more implementation directed projects,
while infectious diseases is an emerging theme. We conclude that demand for
solutions for medical needs leads to expanded funding for implementation- and
impact-oriented research. Basic biomedical research remains present in programs
driven by scientific initiative and strategies based on excellence, but may be
at risk of declining funding opportunities.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse neural networks are a key factor in developing resource-efficient
machine learning applications. We propose the novel and powerful sparse
learning method Adaptive Regularized Training (ART) to compress dense into
sparse networks. Instead of the commonly used binary mask during training to
reduce the number of model weights, we inherently shrink weights close to zero
in an iterative manner with increasing weight regularization. Our method
compresses the pre-trained model knowledge into the weights of highest
magnitude. Therefore, we introduce a novel regularization loss named
HyperSparse that exploits the highest weights while conserving the ability of
weight exploration. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and TinyImageNet show that
our method leads to notable performance gains compared to other sparsification
methods, especially in extremely high sparsity regimes up to 99.8 percent model
sparsity. Additional investigations provide new insights into the patterns that
are encoded in weights with high magnitudes.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work has looked to understand user perceptions of speech agent
capabilities as dialogue partners (termed partner models), and how this affects
user interaction. Yet, currently partner model effects are inferred from
language production as no metrics are available to quantify these subjective
perceptions more directly. Through three studies, we develop and validate the
Partner Modelling Questionnaire (PMQ): an 18-item self-report semantic
differential scale designed to reliably measure people's partner models of
non-embodied speech interfaces. Through principal component analysis and
confirmatory factor analysis, we show that the PMQ scale consists of three
factors: communicative competence and dependability, human-likeness in
communication, and communicative flexibility. Our studies show that the measure
consistently demonstrates good internal reliability, strong test-retest
reliability over 12 and 4-week intervals, and predictable convergent/divergent
validity. Based on our findings we discuss the multidimensional nature of
partner models, whilst identifying key future research avenues that the
development of the PMQ facilitates. Notably, this includes the need to identify
the activation, sensitivity, and dynamism of partner models in speech interface
interaction.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance the state estimator
for high-speed autonomous race cars, addressing challenges related to
unreliable measurements, localization failures, and computing resource
management. The proposed robust localization system utilizes a Bayesian-based
probabilistic approach to evaluate multimodal measurements, ensuring the use of
credible data for accurate and reliable localization, even in harsh racing
conditions. To tackle potential localization failures during intense racing, we
present a resilient navigation system. This system enables the race car to
continue track-following by leveraging direct perception information in
planning and execution, ensuring continuous performance despite localization
disruptions. Efficient computing resource management is critical to avoid
overload and system failure. We optimize computing resources using an efficient
LiDAR-based state estimation method. Leveraging CUDA programming and GPU
acceleration, we perform nearest points search and covariance computation
efficiently, overcoming CPU bottlenecks. Real-world and simulation tests
validate the system's performance and resilience. The proposed approach
successfully recovers from failures, effectively preventing accidents and
ensuring race car safety.

<p class="mathjax">Testing pushdown reactive systems is deemed important to guarantee a precise
and robust software development process. Usually, such systems can be specified
by the formalism of Input/Output Visibly Pushdown Labeled Transition System
(IOVPTS), where the interaction with the environment is regulated by a pushdown
memory. Hence a conformance checking can be applied in a testing process to
verify whether an implementation is in compliance to a specification using an
appropriate conformance relation. In this work we establish a novelty
conformance relation based on Visibly Pushdown Languages (VPLs) that can model
sets of desirable and undesirable behaviors of systems. Further, we show that
test suites with a complete fault coverage can be generated using this
conformance relation for pushdown reactive systems.

uncertainty on the annotation of discourse relations on spoken conversational

and pair of turns across speakers) is a significant predictor of confidence
scores. We compute distributed representations of discourse relations from
co-occurrence statistics that incorporate information about confidence scores
and dialogue context. We perform a hierarchical clustering analysis using these

<p class="mathjax">Continual shrinking of pattern dimensions in the semiconductor domain is
making it increasingly difficult to inspect defects due to factors such as the
presence of stochastic noise and the dynamic behavior of defect patterns and
types. Conventional rule-based methods and non-parametric supervised machine
learning algorithms like KNN mostly fail at the requirements of semiconductor
defect inspection at these advanced nodes. Deep Learning (DL)-based methods
have gained popularity in the semiconductor defect inspection domain because
they have been proven robust towards these challenging scenarios. In this
research work, we have presented an automated DL-based approach for efficient
localization and classification of defects in SEM images. We have proposed
SEMI-CenterNet (SEMI-CN), a customized CN architecture trained on SEM images of
semiconductor wafer defects. The use of the proposed CN approach allows
improved computational efficiency compared to previously studied DL models.
SEMI-CN gets trained to output the center, class, size, and offset of a defect
instance. This is different from the approach of most object detection models
that use anchors for bounding box prediction. Previous methods predict
redundant bounding boxes, most of which are discarded in postprocessing. CN
mitigates this by only predicting boxes for likely defect center points. We
train SEMI-CN on two datasets and benchmark two ResNet backbones for the
framework. Initially, ResNet models pretrained on the COCO dataset undergo
training using two datasets separately. Primarily, SEMI-CN shows significant
improvement in inference time against previous research works. Finally,
transfer learning (using weights of custom SEM dataset) is applied from ADI
dataset to AEI dataset and vice-versa, which reduces the required training time
for both backbones to reach the best mAP against conventional training method.

<p class="mathjax">People with Parkinson's Disease experience gait impairments that
significantly impact their quality of life. Visual, auditory, and tactile cues
can alleviate gait impairments, but they can become less effective due to the
progressive nature of the disease and changes in people's motor capability. In
this study, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HIL) framework that monitors two
key gait parameters, stride length and cadence, and continuously learns a
person-specific model of how the parameters change in response to the feedback.
The model is then used in an optimization algorithm to improve the gait
parameters. This feasibility study examines whether auditory cues can be used
to influence stride length in people without gait impairments. The results
demonstrate the benefits of the HIL framework in maintaining people's stride
length in the presence of a secondary task.

<p class="mathjax">The nonnegative rank of nonnegative matrices is an important quantity that
appears in many fields, such as combinatorial optimization, communication
complexity, and information theory. In this paper, we study the asymptotic
growth of the nonnegative rank of a fixed nonnegative matrix under Kronecker
product. This quantity is called the asymptotic nonnegative rank, which is
already studied in information theory. By applying the theory of asymptotic
spectra of V. Strassen (J. Reine Angew. Math. 1988), we introduce the
asymptotic spectrum of nonnegative matrices and give a dual characterization of
the asymptotic nonnegative rank. As the opposite of nonnegative rank, we
introduce the notion of the subrank of a nonnegative matrix and show that it is
exactly equal to the size of the maximum induced matching of the bipartite
graph defined on the support of the matrix (therefore, independent of the value
of entries). Finally, we show that two matrix parameters, namely rank and
fractional cover number, belong to the asymptotic spectrum of nonnegative
matrices.

<p class="mathjax">A large catalogue size is one of the central challenges in training
recommendation models: a large number of items makes them memory and
computationally inefficient to compute scores for all items during training,
forcing these models to deploy negative sampling. However, negative sampling
increases the proportion of positive interactions in the training data, and
therefore models trained with negative sampling tend to overestimate the
probabilities of positive interactions a phenomenon we call overconfidence.
While the absolute values of the predicted scores or probabilities are not
important for the ranking of retrieved recommendations, overconfident models
may fail to estimate nuanced differences in the top-ranked items, resulting in
degraded performance. In this paper, we show that overconfidence explains why
the popular SASRec model underperforms when compared to BERT4Rec. This is
contrary to the BERT4Rec authors explanation that the difference in performance
is due to the bi-directional attention mechanism. To mitigate overconfidence,
we propose a novel Generalised Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function (gBCE) and
theoretically prove that it can mitigate overconfidence. We further propose the
gSASRec model, an improvement over SASRec that deploys an increased number of
negatives and the gBCE loss. We show through detailed experiments on three
datasets that gSASRec does not exhibit the overconfidence problem. As a result,
gSASRec can outperform BERT4Rec (e.g. +9.47% NDCG on the MovieLens-1M dataset),
while requiring less training time (e.g. -73% training time on MovieLens-1M).
Moreover, in contrast to BERT4Rec, gSASRec is suitable for large datasets that
contain more than 1 million items.

<p class="mathjax">Wearable devices like smart glasses have gained popularity across various
applications. However, their limited computational capabilities pose challenges
for tasks that require extensive processing, such as image and video
processing, leading to drained device batteries. To address this, offloading
such tasks to nearby powerful remote devices, such as mobile devices or remote
servers, has emerged as a promising solution. This paper focuses on analyzing
task-offloading scenarios for a healthcare monitoring application performed on
smart wearable glasses, aiming to identify the optimal conditions for
offloading. The study evaluates performance metrics including task completion
time, computing capabilities, and energy consumption under realistic
conditions. A specific use case is explored within an indoor area like an
airport, where security agents wearing smart glasses to detect elevated body

highlight the potential benefits of task offloading for wearable devices in
healthcare settings, demonstrating its practicality and relevance.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in learning reusable motion priors have demonstrated their
effectiveness in generating naturalistic behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
new learning framework in this paradigm for controlling physics-based
characters with significantly improved motion quality and diversity over
existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method uses reinforcement
learning (RL) to initially track and imitate life-like movements from
unstructured motion clips using the discrete information bottleneck, as adopted
in the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). This structure
compresses the most relevant information from the motion clips into a compact
yet informative latent space, i.e., a discrete space over vector quantized
codes. By sampling codes in the space from a trained categorical prior
distribution, high-quality life-like behaviors can be generated, similar to the
usage of VQ-VAE in computer vision. Although this prior distribution can be
trained with the supervision of the encoder's output, it follows the original
motion clip distribution in the dataset and could lead to imbalanced behaviors
in our setting. To address the issue, we further propose a technique named
prior shifting to adjust the prior distribution using curiosity-driven RL. The
outcome distribution is demonstrated to offer sufficient behavioral diversity
and significantly facilitates upper-level policy learning for downstream tasks.
We conduct comprehensive experiments using humanoid characters on two
challenging downstream tasks, sword-shield striking and two-player boxing game.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of controlling
the character to perform considerably high-quality movements in terms of
behavioral strategies, diversity, and realism. Videos, codes, and data are

<p class="mathjax">Text evaluation has historically posed significant challenges, often
demanding substantial labor and time cost. With the emergence of large language
models (LLMs), researchers have explored LLMs' potential as alternatives for
human evaluation. While these single-agent-based approaches show promise,
experimental results suggest that further advancements are needed to bridge the
gap between their current effectiveness and human-level evaluation quality.
Recognizing that best practices of human evaluation processes often involve
multiple human annotators collaborating in the evaluation, we resort to a
multi-agent debate framework, moving beyond single-agent prompting strategies.
The multi-agent-based approach enables a group of LLMs to synergize with an
array of intelligent counterparts, harnessing their distinct capabilities and
expertise to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in handling intricate tasks.
In this paper, we construct a multi-agent referee team called ChatEval to
autonomously discuss and evaluate the quality of generated responses from
different models on open-ended questions and traditional natural language
generation (NLG) tasks. Our analysis shows that ChatEval transcends mere
textual scoring, offering a human-mimicking evaluation process for reliable
assessments. Our code is available at https://github.com/chanchimin/ChatEval.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the flexible representation of arbitrary-shaped scene text and simple
pipeline, bottom-up segmentation-based methods begin to be mainstream in
real-time scene text detection. Despite great progress, these methods show
deficiencies in robustness and still suffer from false positives and instance
adhesion. Different from existing methods which integrate multiple-granularity
features or multiple outputs, we resort to the perspective of representation
learning in which auxiliary tasks are utilized to enable the encoder to jointly
learn robust features with the main task of per-pixel classification during
optimization. For semantic representation learning, we propose global-dense
semantic contrast (GDSC), in which a vector is extracted for global semantic
representation, then used to perform element-wise contrast with the dense grid
features. To learn instance-aware representation, we propose to combine
top-down modeling (TDM) with the bottom-up framework to provide implicit
instance-level clues for the encoder. With the proposed GDSC and TDM, the
encoder network learns stronger representation without introducing any
parameters and computations during inference. Equipped with a very light
decoder, the detector can achieve more robust real-time scene text detection.
Experimental results on four public datasets show that the proposed method can
outperform or be comparable to the state-of-the-art on both accuracy and speed.
Specifically, the proposed method achieves 87.2% F-measure with 48.2 FPS on
Total-Text and 89.6% F-measure with 36.9 FPS on MSRA-TD500 on a single GeForce
RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

<p class="mathjax">We study the successive refinement setting of Shannon cipher system (SCS)
under the maximal leakage constraint for discrete memoryless sources under
bounded distortion measures. Specifically, we generalize the threat model for
the point-to-point rate-distortion setting of Issa, Wagner and Kamath (T-IT
2020) to the multiterminal successive refinement setting. Under mild conditions
that correspond to partial secrecy, we characterize the asymptotically optimal
normalized maximal leakage region for both the joint excess-distortion
probability (JEP) and the expected distortion reliability constraints. Under
JEP, in the achievability part, we propose a type-based coding scheme, analyze
the reliability guarantee for JEP and bound the leakage of the information
source through compressed versions. In the converse part, by analyzing a
guessing scheme of the eavesdropper, we prove the optimality of our
achievability result. Under expected distortion, the achievability part is
established similarly to the JEP counterpart. The converse proof proceeds by
generalizing the corresponding results for the rate-distortion setting of SCS
by Schieler and Cuff (T-IT 2014) to the successive refinement setting. Somewhat
surprisingly, the normalized maximal leakage regions under both JEP and
expected distortion constraints are identical under certain conditions,
although JEP appears to be a stronger reliability constraint.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple object tracking (MOT) has been successfully investigated in computer
vision.
<br />However, MOT for the videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is
still challenging due to small object size, blurred object appearance, and very
large and/or irregular motion in both ground objects and UAV platforms.
<br />In this paper, we propose FOLT to mitigate these problems and reach fast and
accurate MOT in UAV view.
<br />Aiming at speed-accuracy trade-off, FOLT adopts a modern detector and
light-weight optical flow extractor to extract object detection features and
motion features at a minimum cost.
<br />Given the extracted flow, the flow-guided feature augmentation is designed to
augment the object detection feature based on its optical flow, which improves
the detection of small objects.
<br />Then the flow-guided motion prediction is also proposed to predict the
object's position in the next frame, which improves the tracking performance of
objects with very large displacements between adjacent frames.
<br />Finally, the tracker matches the detected objects and predicted objects using
a spatially matching scheme to generate tracks for every object.
<br />Experiments on Visdrone and UAVDT datasets show that our proposed model can
successfully track small objects with large and irregular motion and outperform
existing state-of-the-art methods in UAV-MOT tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Structured pruning and quantization are promising approaches for reducing the
inference time and memory footprint of neural networks. However, most existing
methods require the original training dataset to fine-tune the model. This not
only brings heavy resource consumption but also is not possible for
applications with sensitive or proprietary data due to privacy and security
concerns. Therefore, a few data-free methods are proposed to address this
problem, but they perform data-free pruning and quantization separately, which
does not explore the complementarity of pruning and quantization. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework named Unified Data-Free Compression(UDFC),
which performs pruning and quantization simultaneously without any data and
fine-tuning process. Specifically, UDFC starts with the assumption that the
partial information of a damaged(e.g., pruned or quantized) channel can be
preserved by a linear combination of other channels, and then derives the
reconstruction form from the assumption to restore the information loss due to
compression. Finally, we formulate the reconstruction error between the
original network and its compressed network, and theoretically deduce the
closed-form solution. We evaluate the UDFC on the large-scale image
classification task and obtain significant improvements over various network
architectures and compression methods. For example, we achieve a 20.54%
accuracy improvement on ImageNet dataset compared to SOTA method with 30%
pruning ratio and 6-bit quantization on ResNet-34.

<p class="mathjax">We consider discrete best approximation problems formulated and solved in the
framework of tropical algebra that deals with semirings and semifields with
idempotent addition. Given a set of samples each consisting of input and output
of an unknown function defined on an idempotent semifield, the problems are to
find a best approximation of the function by tropical Puiseux polynomial and
rational functions. A new solution approach is proposed which involves the
reduction of the problem of polynomial approximation to best approximate
solution of a tropical linear vector equation with an unknown vector on one
side (a one-sided equation). We derive a best approximate solution to the
one-sided equation end evaluate the inherent approximation error in a direct
analytical form. Furthermore, we reduce the rational approximation problem to
the best approximate solution of an equation with unknown vectors on both sides
(a two-sided equation). A best approximate solution to the two-sided equation
is obtained in numerical form by using an iterative alternating algorithm. To
illustrate the technique developed, we solve example approximation problems in
terms of a real semifield where addition is defined as maximum and
multiplication as arithmetic addition (max-plus algebra), which correspond to
the best Chebyshev approximation by piecewise linear functions.

<p class="mathjax">A key challenge in professional fact-checking is its limited scalability in
relation to the magnitude of false information. While many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tools have been proposed to enhance fact-checking efficiency
and scalability, both academic research and fact-checking organizations report
limited adoption of such tooling due to insufficient alignment with
fact-checker practices, values, and needs. To address this gap, we investigate
a co-design method, Matchmaking for AI, which facilitates fact-checkers,
designers, and NLP researchers to collaboratively discover what fact-checker
needs should be addressed by technology and how. Our co-design sessions with 22
professional fact-checkers yielded a set of 11 novel design ideas. They assist
in information searching, processing, and writing tasks for efficient and
personalized fact-checking; help fact-checkers proactively prepare for future
misinformation; monitor their potential biases; and support internal
organization collaboration. Our work offers implications for human-centered

<p class="mathjax">We propose a method named AudioFormer, which learns audio feature
representations through the acquisition of discrete acoustic codes and
subsequently fine-tunes them for audio classification tasks. Initially, we
introduce a novel perspective by considering the audio classification task as a
form of natural language understanding (NLU). Leveraging an existing neural
audio codec model, we generate discrete acoustic codes and utilize them to
train a masked language model (MLM), thereby obtaining audio feature
representations. Furthermore, we pioneer the integration of a
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}ositive sample \textbf{C}ontrastive (MPC) learning
approach. This method enables the learning of joint representations among
multiple discrete acoustic codes within the same audio input. In our
experiments, we treat discrete acoustic codes as textual data and train a
masked language model using a cloze-like methodology, ultimately deriving
high-quality audio representations. Notably, the MPC learning technique
effectively captures collaborative representations among distinct positive
samples. Our research outcomes demonstrate that AudioFormer attains
significantly improved performance compared to prevailing monomodal audio
classification models across multiple datasets, and even outperforms
audio-visual multimodal classification models on select datasets. Specifically,
our approach achieves remarkable results on datasets including AudioSet (2M,
20K), and FSD50K, with performance scores of 53.9, 45.1, and 65.6,
respectively. We have openly shared both the code and models:

accurate yet comprehensive information to recommender systems. The majority of
previous work either focuses on learning effective item representation during
modelling user-item interactions, or exploring item-item relationships by
analysing multi-modal features. Those methods, however, fail to incorporate the
collaborative item-user-item relationships into the multi-modal feature-based
item structure. In this work, we propose a graph-based item structure
enhancement method MM-GEF: Multi-Modal recommendation with Graph Early-Fusion,
which effectively combines the latent item structure underlying multi-modal
contents with the collaborative signals. Instead of processing the content
feature in different modalities separately, we show that the early-fusion of
multi-modal features provides significant improvement. MM-GEF learns refined
item representations by injecting structural information obtained from both
multi-modal and collaborative signals. Through extensive experiments on four

<p class="mathjax">Performance estimation under covariate shift is a crucial component of safe
AI model deployment, especially for sensitive use-cases. Recently, several
solutions were proposed to tackle this problem, most leveraging model
predictions or softmax confidence to derive accuracy estimates. However, under
dataset shifts, confidence scores may become ill-calibrated if samples are too
far from the training distribution. In this work, we show that taking into
account distances of test samples to their expected training distribution can
significantly improve performance estimation under covariate shift. Precisely,
we introduce a "distance-check" to flag samples that lie too far from the
expected distribution, to avoid relying on their untrustworthy model outputs in
the accuracy estimation step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method
on 13 image classification tasks, across a wide-range of natural and synthetic
distribution shifts and hundreds of models, with a median relative MAE
improvement of 27% over the best baseline across all tasks, and SOTA
performance on 10 out of 13 tasks. Our code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods typically rely on the
reprojection error to capture geometric relationships between successive frames
in static environments. However, this assumption does not hold in dynamic
objects in scenarios, leading to errors during the view synthesis stage, such
as feature mismatch and occlusion, which can significantly reduce the accuracy
of the generated depth maps. To address this problem, we propose a novel
dynamic cost volume that exploits residual optical flow to describe moving
objects, improving incorrectly occluded regions in static cost volumes used in
previous work. Nevertheless, the dynamic cost volume inevitably generates extra
occlusions and noise, thus we alleviate this by designing a fusion module that
makes static and dynamic cost volumes compensate for each other. In other
words, occlusion from the static volume is refined by the dynamic volume, and
incorrect information from the dynamic volume is eliminated by the static
volume. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid distillation loss to reduce
photometric error inaccuracy at low resolutions and an adaptive photometric
error loss to alleviate the flow direction of the large gradient in the
occlusion regions. We conducted extensive experiments on the KITTI and
Cityscapes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms
previously published baselines for self-supervised monocular depth estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Blind face restoration aims at recovering high-quality face images from those
with unknown degradations. Current algorithms mainly introduce priors to
complement high-quality details and achieve impressive progress. However, most
of these algorithms ignore abundant contextual information in the face and its
interplay with the priors, leading to sub-optimal performance. Moreover, they
pay less attention to the gap between the synthetic and real-world scenarios,
limiting the robustness and generalization to real-world applications. In this
work, we propose RestoreFormer++, which on the one hand introduces
fully-spatial attention mechanisms to model the contextual information and the
interplay with the priors, and on the other hand, explores an extending
degrading model to help generate more realistic degraded face images to
alleviate the synthetic-to-real-world gap. Compared with current algorithms,
RestoreFormer++ has several crucial benefits. First, instead of using a
multi-head self-attention mechanism like the traditional visual transformer, we
introduce multi-head cross-attention over multi-scale features to fully explore
spatial interactions between corrupted information and high-quality priors. In
this way, it can facilitate RestoreFormer++ to restore face images with higher
realness and fidelity. Second, in contrast to the recognition-oriented
dictionary, we learn a reconstruction-oriented dictionary as priors, which
contains more diverse high-quality facial details and better accords with the
restoration target. Third, we introduce an extending degrading model that
contains more realistic degraded scenarios for training data synthesizing, and
thus helps to enhance the robustness and generalization of our RestoreFormer++
model. Extensive experiments show that RestoreFormer++ outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Remote operation is a crucial solution to problems encountered in
agricultural machinery operations. However, traditional video streaming control
methods fall short in overcoming the challenges of single perspective views and
the inability to obtain 3D information. In light of these issues, our research
proposes a large-scale digital map reconstruction and immersive human-machine
remote control framework for agricultural scenarios. In our methodology, a DJI
unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) was utilized for data collection, and a novel
video segmentation approach based on feature points was introduced. To tackle
texture richness variability, an enhanced Structure from Motion (SfM) using
superpixel segmentation was implemented. This method integrates the open
Multiple View Geometry (openMVG) framework along with Local Features from
Transformers (LoFTR). The enhanced SfM results in a point cloud map, which is
further processed through Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to generate a complete map
model. For control, a closed-loop system utilizing TCP for VR control and
positioning of agricultural machinery was introduced. Our system offers a fully
visual-based immersive control method, where upon connection to the local area
network, operators can utilize VR for immersive remote control. The proposed
method enhances both the robustness and convenience of the reconstruction
process, thereby significantly facilitating operators in acquiring more
comprehensive on-site information and engaging in immersive remote control
operations. The code is available at: https://github.com/LiuTao1126/Enhance-SFM

<p class="mathjax">A unifying $\alpha$-parametrized generator loss function is introduced for a
dual-objective generative adversarial network (GAN), which uses a canonical (or
classical) discriminator loss function such as the one in the original GAN
(VanillaGAN) system. The generator loss function is based on a symmetric class
probability estimation type function, $\mathcal{L}_\alpha$, and the resulting
GAN system is termed $\mathcal{L}_\alpha$-GAN. Under an optimal discriminator,
it is shown that the generator's optimization problem consists of minimizing a
Jensen-$f_\alpha$-divergence, a natural generalization of the Jensen-Shannon
divergence, where $f_\alpha$ is a convex function expressed in terms of the
loss function $\mathcal{L}_\alpha$. It is also demonstrated that this
$\mathcal{L}_\alpha$-GAN problem recovers as special cases a number of GAN
problems in the literature, including VanillaGAN, Least Squares GAN (LSGAN),
Least $k$th order GAN (L$k$GAN) and the recently introduced
$(\alpha_D,\alpha_G)$-GAN with $\alpha_D=1$. Finally, experimental results are
conducted on three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Stacked MNIST to illustrate
the performance of various examples of the $\mathcal{L}_\alpha$-GAN system.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we draw inspiration from Alberto Elfes' pioneering work in
1989, where he introduced the concept of the occupancy grid as World Models for
robots. We imbue the robot with a spatial-temporal world model, termed
UniWorld, to perceive its surroundings and predict the future behavior of other
participants. UniWorld involves initially predicting 4D geometric occupancy as
the World Models for foundational stage and subsequently fine-tuning on
downstream tasks. UniWorld can estimate missing information concerning the
world state and predict plausible future states of the world. Besides,
UniWorld's pre-training process is label-free, enabling the utilization of
massive amounts of image-LiDAR pairs to build a Foundational Model.The proposed
unified pre-training framework demonstrates promising results in key tasks such
as motion prediction, multi-camera 3D object detection, and surrounding
semantic scene completion. When compared to monocular pre-training methods on
the nuScenes dataset, UniWorld shows a significant improvement of about 1.5% in
IoU for motion prediction, 2.0% in mAP and 2.0% in NDS for multi-camera 3D
object detection, as well as a 3% increase in mIoU for surrounding semantic
scene completion. By adopting our unified pre-training method, a 25% reduction
in 3D training annotation costs can be achieved, offering significant practical
value for the implementation of real-world autonomous driving. Codes are
publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/UniWorld.

<p class="mathjax">The Maximum k-Defective Clique Problem (MDCP) aims to find a maximum
k-defective clique in a given graph, where a k-defective clique is a relaxation
clique missing at most k edges. MDCP is NP-hard and finds many real-world
applications in analyzing dense but not necessarily complete subgraphs. Exact
algorithms for MDCP mainly follow the Branch-and-bound (BnB) framework, whose
performance heavily depends on the quality of the upper bound on the
cardinality of a maximum k-defective clique. The state-of-the-art BnB MDCP
algorithms calculate the upper bound quickly but conservatively as they ignore
many possible missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel CoLoring-based
Upper Bound (CLUB) that uses graph coloring techniques ingeniously to detect
independent sets so as to detect missing edges ignored by the previous methods.
We then develop a new BnB algorithm for MDCP, called KD-Club, using CLUB in
both the preprocessing stage for graph reduction and the BnB searching process
for branch pruning. Extensive experiments show that KD-Club significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art BnB MDCP algorithms on the number of solved
instances within the cut-off time, having much smaller search tree and shorter
solving time on various benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Accomplishing household tasks such as 'bringing a cup of water' requires
planning step-by-step actions by maintaining knowledge about the spatial
arrangement of objects and the consequences of previous actions. Perception
models of the current embodied AI agents, however, often make mistakes due to a
lack of such knowledge but rely on imperfect learning of imitating agents or an
algorithmic planner without knowledge about the changed environment by the
previous actions. To address the issue, we propose CPEM (Context-aware Planner
and Environment-aware Memory) to incorporate the contextual information of
previous actions for planning and maintaining spatial arrangement of objects
with their states (e.g., if an object has been moved or not) in an environment
to the perception model for improving both visual navigation and object
interaction. We observe that CPEM achieves state-of-the-art task success
performance in various metrics using a challenging interactive instruction
following benchmark both in seen and unseen environments by large margins (up
to +10.70% in unseen env.). CPEM with the templated actions, named ECLAIR, also
won the 1st generalist language grounding agents challenge at Embodied AI
Workshop in CVPR'23.

<p class="mathjax">Today, vehicles use smart sensors to collect data from the road environment.
This data is often processed onboard of the vehicles, using expensive hardware.
Such onboard processing increases the vehicle's cost, quickly drains its
battery, and exhausts its computing resources. Therefore, offloading tasks onto
the cloud is required. Still, data offloading is challenging due to low latency
requirements for safe and reliable vehicle driving decisions. Moreover, age of
processing was not considered in prior research dealing with low-latency
offloading for autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an age of
processing-based offloading approach for autonomous vehicles using unsupervised
machine learning, Multi-Radio Access Technologies (multi-RATs), and Edge
Computing in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). We design a collaboration space
of edge clouds to process data in proximity to autonomous vehicles. To reduce
the variation in offloading delay, we propose a new communication planning
approach that enables the vehicle to optimally preselect the available RATs
such as Wi-Fi, LTE, or 5G to offload tasks to edge clouds when its local
resources are insufficient. We formulate an optimization problem for age-based
offloading that minimizes elapsed time from generating tasks and receiving
computation output. To handle this non-convex problem, we develop a surrogate
problem. Then, we use the Lagrangian method to transform the surrogate problem
to unconstrained optimization problem and apply the dual decomposition method.
The simulation results show that our approach significantly minimizes the age
of processing in data offloading with 90.34 % improvement over similar method.

machine learning models. This study examined the influence of sample size on
explanations from models in a Rash\=omon set using SHAP. Experiments on 5
public datasets showed that explanations gradually converged as the sample size
increased. Explanations from &lt;128 samples exhibited high variability, limiting
reliable knowledge extraction. However, agreement between models improved with
more data, allowing for consensus. Bagging ensembles often had higher
agreement. The results provide guidance on sufficient data to trust
explanations. Variability at low samples suggests that conclusions may be
unreliable without validation. Further work is needed with more model types,

<p class="mathjax">Offloading computation-intensive tasks to edge clouds has become an efficient
way to support resource constraint edge devices. However, task offloading delay
is an issue largely due to the networks with limited capacities between edge
clouds and edge devices. In this paper, we consider task offloading in Open
Radio Access Network (O-RAN), which is a new 5G RAN architecture allowing Open
Central Unit (O-CU) to be co-located with Open Distributed Unit (DU) at the
edge cloud for low-latency services. O-RAN relies on fronthaul network to
connect O-RAN Radio Units (O-RUs) and edge clouds that host O-DUs.
Consequently, tasks are offloaded onto the edge clouds via wireless and
fronthaul networks \cite{10045045}, which requires routing. Since edge clouds
do not have the same available computation resources and tasks' computation
deadlines are different, we need a task distribution approach to multiple edge
clouds. Prior work has never addressed this joint problem of task offloading,
fronthaul routing, and edge computing. To this end, using segment routing,
O-RAN intelligent controllers, and multiple edge clouds, we formulate an
optimization problem to minimize offloading, fronthaul routing, and computation
delays in O-RAN. To determine the solution of this NP-hard problem, we use Deep
Q-Learning assisted by federated learning with a reward function that reduces
the Cost of Delay (CoD). The simulation results show that our solution
maximizes the reward in minimizing CoD.

<p class="mathjax">Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in harsh and unstructured Sub-Terranean
(Sub-T) environments in the presence of aerosol particles have recently become
the main focus in the field of robotics. Aerosol particles such as smoke and
dust directly affect the performance of any mobile robotic platform due to
their reliance on their onboard perception systems for autonomous navigation
and localization in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied
environments. Although obstacle avoidance and object detection algorithms are
robust to the presence of noise to some degree, their performance directly
relies on the quality of captured data by onboard sensors such as Light
Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and camera. Thus, this paper proposes a novel
modular agnostic filtration pipeline based on intensity and spatial information
such as local point density for removal of detected smoke particles from Point
Cloud (PCL) prior to its utilization for collision detection. Furthermore, the
efficacy of the proposed framework in the presence of smoke during multiple
frontier exploration missions is investigated while the experimental results
are presented to facilitate comparison with other methodologies and their
computational impact. This provides valuable insight to the research community
for better utilization of filtration schemes based on available computation
resources while considering the safe autonomous navigation of mobile robots.

<p class="mathjax">The paradigm of joint communications and sensing (JCAS) envisions a
revolutionary integration of communication and radar functionalities within a
unified hardware platform. This novel concept not only opens up unprecedented
possibilities, but also presents unique challenges. Its success is highly
dependent on efficient full-duplex (FD) operation, which has the potential to
enable simultaneous transmission and reception within the same frequency band.
While ongoing research explores the potential of JCAS, there are related
avenues of investigation that hold tremendous potential to profoundly transform
the sixth generation (6G) and beyond cellular networks. This article sheds
light on the new opportunities and challenges presented by JCAS by taking into
account the key technical challenges of FD systems. Unlike simplified JCAS
scenarios, we delve into the most comprehensive configuration, encompassing
uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users, as well as monostatic and bistatic radars,
all harmoniously coexisting to jointly push the boundaries of both the
communications and sensing performance. The performance improvements introduced
by this advancement bring forth numerous new challenges, each meticulously
examined and expounded upon.

<p class="mathjax">African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are an endangered species. Little is
known regarding their underwater hunting strategies and associated predation
success rates, yet this is essential for guiding conservation. Modern
bio-logging technology has the potential to provide valuable insights, but
manually analysing large amounts of data from animal-borne video recorders
(AVRs) is time-consuming. In this paper, we publish an animal-borne underwater
video dataset of penguins and introduce a ready-to-deploy deep learning system
capable of robustly detecting penguins (mAP50@98.0%) and also instances of fish
(mAP50@73.3%). We note that the detectors benefit explicitly from air-bubble
learning to improve accuracy. Extending this detector towards a dual-stream
behaviour recognition network, we also provide the first results for
identifying predation behaviour in penguin underwater videos. Whilst results
are promising, further work is required for useful applicability of predation
behaviour detection in field scenarios. In summary, we provide a highly
reliable underwater penguin detector, a fish detector, and a valuable first
attempt towards an automated visual detection of complex behaviours in a marine
predator. We publish the networks, the DivingWithPenguins video dataset,
annotations, splits, and weights for full reproducibility and immediate
usability by practitioners.

<p class="mathjax">In the committee selection problem, the goal is to choose a subset of size
$k$ from a set of candidates $C$ that collectively gives the best
representation to a set of voters. We consider this problem in Euclidean
$d$-space where each voter/candidate is a point and voters' preferences are
implicitly represented by Euclidean distances to candidates. We explore
fault-tolerance in committee selection and study the following three variants:
(1) given a committee and a set of $f$ failing candidates, find their optimal
replacement; (2) compute the worst-case replacement score for a given committee
under failure of $f$ candidates; and (3) design a committee with the best
replacement score under worst-case failures. The score of a committee is
determined using the well-known (min-max) Chamberlin-Courant rule: minimize the
maximum distance between any voter and its closest candidate in the committee.
Our main results include the following: (1) in one dimension, all three
problems can be solved in polynomial time; (2) in dimension $d \geq 2$, all
three problems are NP-hard; and (3) all three problems admit a constant-factor
approximation in any fixed dimension, and the optimal committee problem has an
FPT bicriterion approximation.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from knowledge cutoff or fallacy
issues, which means they are unaware of unseen events or generate text with
incorrect facts owing to the outdated/noisy data. To this end, many knowledge
editing approaches for LLMs have emerged -- aiming to subtly inject/edit
updated knowledge or adjust undesired behavior while minimizing the impact on
unrelated inputs. Nevertheless, due to significant differences among various
knowledge editing methods and the variations in task setups, there is no
standard implementation framework available for the community, which hinders
practitioners to apply knowledge editing to applications. To address these
issues, we propose EasyEdit, an easy-to-use knowledge editing framework for
LLMs. It supports various cutting-edge knowledge editing approaches and can be
readily apply to many well-known LLMs such as T5, GPT-J, LlaMA, etc.
Empirically, we report the knowledge editing results on LlaMA-2 with EasyEdit,
demonstrating that knowledge editing surpasses traditional fine-tuning in terms
of reliability and generalization. We have released the source code on GitHub
at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit, along with Google Colab tutorials and
comprehensive documentation for beginners to get started. Besides, we present
an online system for real-time knowledge editing, and a demo video at

<p class="mathjax">Prompt-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) paradigm have succeeded
substantially in few-shot natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design
the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly,
inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization
methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the
gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low
readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research
gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt
Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment
strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we
propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts
with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally.
By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the
tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover,
subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality,
robustness, and generalization ability.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled edge federated learning (FL) has
sparked a rise in research interest as a result of the massive and
heterogeneous data collected by UAVs, as well as the privacy concerns related
to UAV data transmissions to edge servers. However, due to the redundancy of
UAV collected data, e.g., imaging data, and non-rigorous FL participant
selection, the convergence time of the FL learning process and bias of the FL
model may increase. Consequently, we investigate in this paper the problem of
selecting UAV participants for edge FL, aiming to improve the FL model's
accuracy, under UAV constraints of energy consumption, communication quality,
and local datasets' heterogeneity. We propose a novel UAV participant selection
scheme, called data-efficient energy-aware participant selection strategy
(DEEPS), which consists of selecting the best FL participant in each sub-region
based on the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) average score of its
local dataset and its power consumption profile. Through experiments, we
demonstrate that the proposed selection scheme is superior to the benchmark
random selection method, in terms of model accuracy, training time, and UAV
energy consumption.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the development of
so-called certifiable perception methods, which leverage semidefinite, convex
relaxations to find global optima of perception problems in robotics. However,
many of these relaxations rely on simplifying assumptions that facilitate the
problem formulation, such as an isotropic measurement noise distribution. In
this paper, we explore the tightness of the semidefinite relaxations of
matrix-weighted (anisotropic) state-estimation problems and reveal the
limitations lurking therein: matrix-weighted factors can cause convex
relaxations to lose tightness. In particular, we show that the semidefinite
relaxations of localization problems with matrix weights may be tight only for
low noise levels. We empirically explore the factors that contribute to this
loss of tightness and demonstrate that redundant constraints can be used to
regain tightness, albeit at the expense of real-time performance. As a second
technical contribution of this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art
relaxation of scalar-weighted SLAM cannot be used when matrix weights are
considered. We provide an alternate formulation and show that its SDP
relaxation is not tight (even for very low noise levels) unless specific
redundant constraints are used. We demonstrate the tightness of our
formulations on both simulated and real-world data.

<p class="mathjax">The works in literature classifying natural and computer generated images are
mostly designed as binary tasks either considering natural images versus
computer graphics images only or natural images versus GAN generated images
only, but not natural images versus both classes of the generated images. Also,
even though this forensic classification task of distinguishing natural and
computer generated images gets the support of the new convolutional neural
networks and transformer based architectures that can give remarkable
classification accuracies, they are seen to fail over the images that have
undergone some post-processing operations usually performed to deceive the
forensic algorithms, such as JPEG compression, gaussian noise, etc. This work
proposes a robust approach towards distinguishing natural and computer
generated images including both, computer graphics and GAN generated images
using a fusion of two vision transformers where each of the transformer
networks operates in different color spaces, one in RGB and the other in YCbCr
color space. The proposed approach achieves high performance gain when compared
to a set of baselines, and also achieves higher robustness and generalizability
than the baselines. The features of the proposed model when visualized are seen
to obtain higher separability for the classes than the input image features and
the baseline features. This work also studies the attention map visualizations
of the networks of the fused model and observes that the proposed methodology
can capture more image information relevant to the forensic task of classifying
natural and generated images.

<p class="mathjax">To address the need for regulating digital technologies without hampering
innovation or pre-digital transformation regulatory frameworks, we provide a
model to evolve Data governance toward Information governance and precise the
relation between these two terms. This model bridges digital and non-digital
information exchange. By considering the question of governed data usage
through the angle of the Principal-Agent problem, we build a distributed
governance model based on Autonomous Principals defined as entities capable of
choice, therefore capable of exercising a transactional sovereignty. Extending
the legal concept of the privacy sphere to a functional equivalent in the
digital space leads to the construction of a digital self to which rights and
accountability can be attached. Ecosystems, defined as communities of
autonomous principals bound by a legitimate authority, provide the basis of
interacting structures of increasing complexity endowed with a self-replicating
property that mirrors physical world governance systems. The model proposes a
governance concept for multi-stakeholder information systems operating across
jurisdictions. Using recent software engineering advances in decentralised
authentication and semantics, we provide a framework, Dynamic Data Economy to
deploy a distributed governance model embedding checks and balance between
human and technological governance. Domain specific governance models are left
for further publications. Similarly, the technical questions related to the
connection between a digital-self and its physical world controller (e.g
biometric binding) will be treated in upcoming publications.

<p class="mathjax">Adapters and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are parameter-efficient fine-tuning
techniques designed to make the training of language models more efficient.
Previous results demonstrated that these methods can even improve performance
on some classification tasks. This paper complements the existing research by
investigating how these techniques influence the classification performance and
computation costs compared to full fine-tuning when applied to multilingual
text classification tasks (genre, framing, and persuasion techniques detection;
with different input lengths, number of predicted classes and classification
difficulty), some of which have limited training data. In addition, we conduct
in-depth analyses of their efficacy across different training scenarios
(training on the original multilingual data; on the translations into English;
and on a subset of English-only data) and different languages. Our findings
provide valuable insights into the applicability of the parameter-efficient
fine-tuning techniques, particularly to complex multilingual and multilabel
classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR is currently one of the most utilized sensors to effectively monitor
the status of power lines and facilitate the inspection of remote power
distribution networks and related infrastructures. To ensure the safe operation
of the smart grid, various remote data acquisition strategies, such as Airborne
Laser Scanning (ALS), Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), and Terrestrial Laser
Scanning (TSL) have been leveraged to allow continuous monitoring of regional
power networks, which are typically surrounded by dense vegetation. In this
article, an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) framework is proposed, to
detect, extract and analyze the characteristics of power lines of both high and
low voltage, as well as the surrounding vegetation in a Power Line Corridor
(PLC) solely from LiDAR data. Initially, the proposed approach eliminates the
ground points from higher elevation points based on statistical analysis that
applies density criteria and histogram thresholding. After denoising and
transforming of the remaining candidate points by applying Principle Component
Analysis (PCA) and Kd-tree, power line segmentation is achieved by utilizing a
two-stage DBSCAN clustering to identify each power line individually. Finally,
all high elevation points in the PLC are identified based on their distance to
the newly segmented power lines. Conducted experiments illustrate that the
proposed framework is an agnostic method that can efficiently detect the power
lines and perform PLC-based hazard analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past few years, deep learning has firmly established its prowess
across various domains, including computer vision, speech recognition, and
natural language processing. Motivated by its outstanding success, researchers
have been directing their efforts towards applying deep learning techniques to
recommender systems. Neural collaborative filtering (NCF) and Neural Matrix
Factorization (NeuMF) refreshes the traditional inner product in matrix
factorization with a neural architecture capable of learning complex and
data-driven functions. While these models effectively capture user-item
interactions, they overlook the specific attributes of both users and items.
This can lead to robustness issues, especially for items and users that belong
to the "long tail". Such challenges are commonly recognized in recommender
systems as a part of the cold-start problem. A direct and intuitive approach to
address this issue is by leveraging the features and attributes of the items
and users themselves. In this paper, we introduce a refined NeuMF model that
considers not only the interaction between users and items, but also acrossing
associated attributes. Moreover, our proposed architecture features a shared
user embedding, seamlessly integrating with user embeddings to imporve the
robustness and effectively address the cold-start problem. Rigorous experiments
on both the Movielens and Pinterest datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
Cross-Attribute Matrix Factorization model, particularly in scenarios
characterized by higher dataset sparsity.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) is a critical tool driving
the rapid iterative development of MT systems. While considerable progress has
been made on estimating a single scalar quality score, current metrics lack the
informativeness of more detailed schemes that annotate individual errors, such
as Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). In this paper, we help fill this gap
by proposing AutoMQM, a prompting technique which leverages the reasoning and
in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and asks them
to identify and categorize errors in translations. We start by evaluating
recent LLMs, such as PaLM and PaLM-2, through simple score prediction
prompting, and we study the impact of labeled data through in-context learning
and finetuning. We then evaluate AutoMQM with PaLM-2 models, and we find that
it improves performance compared to just prompting for scores (with
particularly large gains for larger models) while providing interpretability
through error spans that align with human annotations.

<p class="mathjax">Sound Event Detection (SED) aims to predict the temporal boundaries of all
the events of interest and their class labels, given an unconstrained audio
sample. Taking either the splitand-classify (i.e., frame-level) strategy or the
more principled event-level modeling approach, all existing methods consider
the SED problem from the discriminative learning perspective. In this work, we
reformulate the SED problem by taking a generative learning perspective.
Specifically, we aim to generate sound temporal boundaries from noisy proposals
in a denoising diffusion process, conditioned on a target audio sample. During
training, our model learns to reverse the noising process by converting noisy
latent queries to the groundtruth versions in the elegant Transformer decoder
framework. Doing so enables the model generate accurate event boundaries from
even noisy queries during inference. Extensive experiments on the Urban-SED and
EPIC-Sounds datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms
existing alternatives, with 40+% faster convergence in training.

<p class="mathjax">Eye-tracking plays a crucial role in the development of virtual reality
devices, neuroscience research, and psychology. Despite its significance in
numerous applications, achieving an accurate, robust, and fast eye-tracking
solution remains a considerable challenge for current state-of-the-art methods.
While existing reflection-based techniques (e.g., "glint tracking") are
considered the most accurate, their performance is limited by their reliance on
sparse 3D surface data acquired solely from the cornea surface. In this paper,
we rethink the way how specular reflections can be used for eye tracking: We
propose a novel method for accurate and fast evaluation of the gaze direction
that exploits teachings from single-shot phase-measuring-deflectometry (PMD).
In contrast to state-of-the-art reflection-based methods, our method acquires
dense 3D surface information of both cornea and sclera within only one single
camera frame (single-shot). Improvements in acquired reflection surface
points("glints") of factors $&gt;3300 \times$ are easily achievable. We show the
feasibility of our approach with experimentally evaluated gaze errors of only
$\leq 0.25^\circ$ demonstrating a significant improvement over the current
state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">The synthesis of human motion has traditionally been addressed through
task-dependent models that focus on specific challenges, such as predicting
future motions or filling in intermediate poses conditioned on known key-poses.
In this paper, we present a novel task-independent model called UNIMASK-M,
which can effectively address these challenges using a unified architecture.
Our model obtains comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art in
each field. Inspired by Vision Transformers (ViTs), our UNIMASK-M model
decomposes a human pose into body parts to leverage the spatio-temporal
relationships existing in human motion. Moreover, we reformulate various
pose-conditioned motion synthesis tasks as a reconstruction problem with
different masking patterns given as input. By explicitly informing our model
about the masked joints, our UNIMASK-M becomes more robust to occlusions.
Experimental results show that our model successfully forecasts human motion on
the Human3.6M dataset. Moreover, it achieves state-of-the-art results in motion
inbetweening on the LaFAN1 dataset, particularly in long transition periods.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual reality (VR) platforms enable a wide range of applications, however
pose unique privacy risks. In particular, VR devices are equipped with a rich
set of sensors that collect personal and sensitive information (e.g., body
motion, eye gaze, hand joints, and facial expression), which can be used to
uniquely identify a user, even without explicit identifiers. In this paper, we
are interested in understanding the extent to which a user can be identified
based on data collected by different VR sensors. We consider adversaries with
capabilities that range from observing APIs available within a single VR app
(app adversary) to observing all, or selected, sensor measurements across all
apps on the VR device (device adversary). To that end, we introduce BEHAVR, a
framework for collecting and analyzing data from all sensor groups collected by
all apps running on a VR device. We use BEHAVR to perform a user study and
collect data from real users that interact with popular real-world apps. We use
that data to build machine learning models for user identification, with
features extracted from sensor data available within and across apps. We show
that these models can identify users with an accuracy of up to 100%, and we
reveal the most important features and sensor groups, depending on the
functionality of the app and the strength of the adversary, as well as the
minimum time needed for user identification. To the best of our knowledge,
BEHAVR is the first to analyze user identification in VR comprehensively, i.e.,
considering jointly all sensor measurements available on a VR device (whether
within an app or across multiple apps), collected by real-world, as opposed to
custom-made, apps.

significantly propelled the generation of AI-crafted text. With rising concerns
about their potential misuse, there is a pressing need for AI-generated-text
forensics. Neural authorship attribution is a forensic effort, seeking to trace
AI-generated text back to its originating LLM. The LLM landscape can be divided
into two primary categories: proprietary and open-source. In this work, we
delve into these emerging categories of LLMs, focusing on the nuances of neural
authorship attribution. To enrich our understanding, we carry out an empirical
analysis of LLM writing signatures, highlighting the contrasts between
proprietary and open-source models, and scrutinizing variations within each
group. By integrating stylometric features across lexical, syntactic, and
structural aspects of language, we explore their potential to yield
interpretable results and augment pre-trained language model-based classifiers
utilized in neural authorship attribution. Our findings, based on a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs, provide empirical insights into neural authorship
attribution, paving the way for future investigations aimed at mitigating the

<p class="mathjax">Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a widely used tile-based algorithm in
procedural content generation, including textures, objects, and scenes.
However, the current WFC algorithm and related research lack the ability to
generate commercialized large-scale or infinite content due to constraint
conflict and time complexity costs. This paper proposes a Nested WFC (N-WFC)
algorithm framework to reduce time complexity. To avoid conflict and
backtracking problems, we offer a complete and sub-complete tileset preparation
strategy, which requires only a small number of tiles to generate aperiodic and
deterministic infinite content. We also introduce the weight-brush system that
combines N-WFC and sub-complete tileset, proving its suitability for game
design. Our contribution addresses WFC's challenge in massive content
generation and provides a theoretical basis for implementing concrete games.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have skyrocketed in popularity in recent years
due to their ability to generate high-quality text in response to human
prompting. However, these models have been shown to have the potential to
generate harmful content in response to user prompting (e.g., giving users
instructions on how to commit crimes). There has been a focus in the literature
on mitigating these risks, through methods like aligning models with human
values through reinforcement learning. However, it has been shown that even
aligned language models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that bypass
their restrictions on generating harmful text. We propose a simple approach to
defending against these attacks by having a large language model filter its own
responses. Our current results show that even if a model is not fine-tuned to
be aligned with human values, it is possible to stop it from presenting harmful
content to users by validating the content using a language model.

<p class="mathjax">Crypto-wallets or digital asset wallets are a crucial aspect of managing
cryptocurrencies and other digital assets such as NFTs. However, these wallets
are not immune to security threats, particularly from the growing risk of
quantum computing. The use of traditional public-key cryptography systems in
digital asset wallets makes them vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers,
which may increase in the future. Moreover, current digital wallets require
users to keep track of seed-phrases, which can be challenging and lead to
additional security risks. To overcome these challenges, a new algorithm is
proposed that uses post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and zero-knowledge proof
(ZKP) to enhance the security of digital asset wallets. The research focuses on
the use of the Lattice-based Threshold Secret Sharing Scheme (LTSSS), Kyber
Algorithm for key generation and ZKP for wallet unlocking, providing a more
secure and user-friendly alternative to seed-phrase, brain and multi-sig
protocol wallets. This algorithm also includes several innovative security
features such as recovery of wallets in case of downtime of the server, and the
ability to rekey the private key associated with a specific username-password
combination, offering improved security and usability. The incorporation of PQC
and ZKP provides a robust and comprehensive framework for securing digital
assets in the present and future. This research aims to address the security
challenges faced by digital asset wallets and proposes practical solutions to
ensure their safety in the era of quantum computing.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the problem of end-to-end multi-person pose
estimation. State-of-the-art solutions adopt the DETR-like framework, and
mainly develop the complex decoder, e.g., regarding pose estimation as keypoint
box detection and combining with human detection in ED-Pose, hierarchically
predicting with pose decoder and joint (keypoint) decoder in PETR. We present a
simple yet effective transformer approach, named Group Pose. We simply regard
$K$-keypoint pose estimation as predicting a set of $N\times K$ keypoint
positions, each from a keypoint query, as well as representing each pose with
an instance query for scoring $N$ pose predictions. Motivated by the intuition
that the interaction, among across-instance queries of different types, is not
directly helpful, we make a simple modification to decoder self-attention. We
replace single self-attention over all the $N\times(K+1)$ queries with two
subsequent group self-attentions: (i) $N$ within-instance self-attention, with
each over $K$ keypoint queries and one instance query, and (ii) $(K+1)$
same-type across-instance self-attention, each over $N$ queries of the same
type. The resulting decoder removes the interaction among across-instance
type-different queries, easing the optimization and thus improving the
performance. Experimental results on MS COCO and CrowdPose show that our
approach without human box supervision is superior to previous methods with
complex decoders, and even is slightly better than ED-Pose that uses human box
supervision. $\href{https://github.com/Michel-liu/GroupPose-Paddle}{\rm

<p class="mathjax">Restoring facial details from low-quality (LQ) images has remained a
challenging problem due to its ill-posedness induced by various degradations in
the wild. The existing codebook prior mitigates the ill-posedness by leveraging
an autoencoder and learned codebook of high-quality (HQ) features, achieving
remarkable quality. However, existing approaches in this paradigm frequently
depend on a single encoder pre-trained on HQ data for restoring HQ images,
disregarding the domain gap between LQ and HQ images. As a result, the encoding
of LQ inputs may be insufficient, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel dual-branch framework named DAEFR. Our
method introduces an auxiliary LQ branch that extracts crucial information from
the LQ inputs. Additionally, we incorporate association training to promote
effective synergy between the two branches, enhancing code prediction and
output quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of DAEFR on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in restoring facial
details.

<p class="mathjax">With a strong understanding of the target domain from natural language, we
produce promising results in translating across large domain gaps and bringing
skeletons back to life. In this work, we use text-guided latent diffusion
models for zero-shot image-to-image translation (I2I) across large domain gaps
(longI2I), where large amounts of new visual features and new geometry need to
be generated to enter the target domain. Being able to perform translations
across large domain gaps has a wide variety of real-world applications in
criminology, astrology, environmental conservation, and paleontology. In this
work, we introduce a new task Skull2Animal for translating between skulls and
living animals. On this task, we find that unguided Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) are not capable of translating across large domain gaps.
Instead of these traditional I2I methods, we explore the use of guided
diffusion and image editing models and provide a new benchmark model,
Revive-2I, capable of performing zero-shot I2I via text-prompting latent
diffusion models. We find that guidance is necessary for longI2I because, to
bridge the large domain gap, prior knowledge about the target domain is needed.
In addition, we find that prompting provides the best and most scalable
information about the target domain as classifier-guided diffusion models
require retraining for specific use cases and lack stronger constraints on the
target domain because of the wide variety of images they are trained on.

<p class="mathjax">Podocytes, specialized epithelial cells that envelop the glomerular
capillaries, play a pivotal role in maintaining renal health. The current
description and quantification of features on pathology slides are limited,
prompting the need for innovative solutions to comprehensively assess diverse
phenotypic attributes within Whole Slide Images (WSIs). In particular,
understanding the morphological characteristics of podocytes, terminally
differentiated glomerular epithelial cells, is crucial for studying glomerular
injury. This paper introduces the Spatial Pathomics Toolkit (SPT) and applies
it to podocyte pathomics. The SPT consists of three main components: (1)
instance object segmentation, enabling precise identification of podocyte
nuclei; (2) pathomics feature generation, extracting a comprehensive array of
quantitative features from the identified nuclei; and (3) robust statistical
analyses, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of spatial relationships
between morphological and spatial transcriptomics features.The SPT successfully
extracted and analyzed morphological and textural features from podocyte
nuclei, revealing a multitude of podocyte morphomic features through
statistical analysis. Additionally, we demonstrated the SPT's ability to
unravel spatial information inherent to podocyte distribution, shedding light
on spatial patterns associated with glomerular injury. By disseminating the
SPT, our goal is to provide the research community with a powerful and
user-friendly resource that advances cellular spatial pathomics in renal
pathology. The implementation and its complete source code of the toolkit are
made openly accessible at https://github.com/hrlblab/spatial_pathomics.

<p class="mathjax">A complete time-parameterized statistical model quantifying the divergent
evolution of protein structures in terms of the patterns of conservation of
their secondary structures is inferred from a large collection of protein 3D
structure alignments. This provides a better alternative to time-parameterized
sequence-based models of protein relatedness, that have clear limitations
dealing with twilight and midnight zones of sequence relationships. Since
protein structures are far more conserved due to the selection pressure
directly placed on their function, divergence time estimates can be more
accurate when inferred from structures. We use the Bayesian and
information-theoretic framework of Minimum Message Length to infer a
time-parameterized stochastic matrix (accounting for perturbed structural
states of related residues) and associated Dirichlet models (accounting for
insertions and deletions during the evolution of protein domains). These are
used in concert to estimate the Markov time of divergence of tertiary
structures, a task previously only possible using proxies (like RMSD). By
analyzing one million pairs of homologous structures, we yield a relationship
between the Markov divergence time of structures and of sequences. Using these
inferred models and the relationship between the divergence of sequences and
structures, we demonstrate a competitive performance in secondary structure
prediction against neural network architectures commonly employed for this
task. The source code and supplementary information are downloadable from

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks (NN) have become almost ubiquitous with image classification,
but in their standard form produce point estimates, with no measure of
confidence. Bayesian neural networks (BNN) provide uncertainty quantification
(UQ) for NN predictions and estimates through the posterior distribution. As NN
are applied in more high-consequence applications, UQ is becoming a
requirement. BNN provide a solution to this problem by not only giving accurate
predictions and estimates, but also an interval that includes reasonable values
within a desired probability. Despite their positive attributes, BNN are
notoriously difficult and time consuming to train. Traditional Bayesian methods
use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but this is often brushed aside as being
too slow. The most common method is variational inference (VI) due to its fast
computation, but there are multiple concerns with its efficacy. We apply and
compare MCMC- and VI-trained BNN in the context of target detection in
hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where materials of interest can be identified by
their unique spectral signature. This is a challenging field, due to the
numerous permuting effects practical collection of HSI has on measured spectra.
Both models are trained using out-of-the-box tools on a high fidelity HSI
target detection scene. Both MCMC- and VI-trained BNN perform well overall at
target detection on a simulated HSI scene. This paper provides an example of
how to utilize the benefits of UQ, but also to increase awareness that
different training methods can give different results for the same model. If
sufficient computational resources are available, the best approach rather than
the fastest or most efficient should be used, especially for high consequence
problems.

<p class="mathjax">We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer
architecture can enable automated detection of clinical phenotype terms,
including terms not documented in the HPO. In this study, we developed two
types of models: PhenoBCBERT, a BERT-based model, utilizing Bio+Clinical BERT
as its pre-trained model, and PhenoGPT, a GPT-based model that can be
initialized from diverse GPT models, including open-source versions such as
GPT-J, Falcon, and LLaMA, as well as closed-source versions such as GPT-3 and
GPT-3.5. We compared our methods with PhenoTagger, a recently developed HPO
recognition tool that combines rule-based and deep learning methods. We found
that our methods can extract more phenotype concepts, including novel ones not
characterized by HPO. We also performed case studies on biomedical literature
to illustrate how new phenotype information can be recognized and extracted. We
compared current BERT-based versus GPT-based models for phenotype tagging, in
multiple aspects including model architecture, memory usage, speed, accuracy,
and privacy protection. We also discussed the addition of a negation step and
an HPO normalization layer to the transformer models for improved HPO term
tagging. In conclusion, PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT enable the automated discovery
of phenotype terms from clinical notes and biomedical literature, facilitating
automated downstream tasks to derive new biological insights on human diseases.

<p class="mathjax">The machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models contribute to
exceptional medical image analysis improvement. The models enhance the
prediction and improve the accuracy by prediction and classification. It helps
the hematologist to diagnose the blood cancer and brain tumor based on
calculations and facts. This review focuses on an in-depth analysis of modern
techniques applied in the domain of medical image analysis of white blood cell
classification. For this review, the methodologies are discussed that have used
blood smear images, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-rays, and similar
medical imaging domains. The main impact of this review is to present a
detailed analysis of machine learning techniques applied for the classification
of white blood cells (WBCs). This analysis provides valuable insight, such as
the most widely used techniques and best-performing white blood cell
classification methods. It was found that in recent decades researchers have
been using ML and DL for white blood cell classification, but there are still
some challenges. 1) Availability of the dataset is the main challenge, and it
could be resolved using data augmentation techniques. 2) Medical training of
researchers is recommended to help them understand the structure of white blood
cells and select appropriate classification models. 3) Advanced DL networks
such as Generative Adversarial Networks, R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and faster R-CNN
can also be used in future techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Human blood mainly comprises plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and
platelets. The blood cells provide the body's cells oxygen to nourish them,
shield them from infections, boost immunity, and aid in clotting. Human health
is reflected in blood cells. The chances that a human being can be diagnosed
with a disease are significantly influenced by their blood cell type and count.
Therefore, blood cell classification is crucial because it helps identify
diseases, including cancer, damaged bone marrow, benign tumors, and their
growth. This classification allows hematologists to distinguish between
different blood cell fragments so that the cause of diseases can be identified.
Convolution neural networks are a deep learning technique that classifies
images of human blood cells (RBCs, WBCs, and platelets) into their subtypes.
For this study, transfer learning is used to apply different CNN pre-trained
models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152, InceptionV3
MobileNetV2 and DenseNet-201 to the PBC dataset's normal DIB. The overall
accuracy achieved with these models lies between 91.375-94.72%. A novel
CNN-based framework has been presented to improve accuracy, and we were able to
attain an accuracy of 99.91% on the PBC dataset.

Inspired by structure of the Gr\"otzsch's graph, we present constructions of
two families of graphs, $G_m$ and $H_m$ for odd and even values of $m$
respectively and on $n = 2m +1$ vertices. We show that each member of this
family is non-planar, triangle-free, and Hamiltonian. Further, when $m$ is odd
the graph $G_m$ is maximal triangle-free, and when $m$ is even, the addition of
exactly $\frac{m}{2}$ edges makes the graph $H_m$ maximal triangle-free. We
show that $G_m$ is 4-chromatic and $H_m$ is 3-chromatic for all $m$. Further,
we note some other properties of these graphs and compare with Mycielski's
construction.

<p class="mathjax">The presence of a high number of zero flow trades continues to provide a
challenge in identifying gravity parameters to explain international trade
using the gravity model. Linear regression with a logarithmic linear equation
encounters an indefinite value on the logarithmic trade. Although several
approaches to solving this problem have been proposed, the majority of them are
no longer based on linear regression, making the process of finding solutions
more complex. In this work, we suggest a two-step technique for determining the
gravity parameters: first, perform linear regression locally to establish a
dummy value to substitute trade flow zero, and then estimating the gravity
parameters. Iterative techniques are used to determine the optimum parameters.
Machine learning is used to test the estimated parameters by analyzing their
position in the cluster. We calculated international trade figures for 2004,
2009, 2014, and 2019. We just examine the classic gravity equation and discover
that the powers of GDP and distance are in the same cluster and are both worth
roughly one. The strategy presented here can be used to solve other problems
involving log-linear regression.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a bilingual solution to support English as secondary locale for
most primary locales in hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) settings. Our
key developments constitute: (a) pronunciation lexicon with grapheme units
instead of phone units, (b) a fully bilingual alignment model and subsequently
bilingual streaming transformer model, (c) a parallel encoder structure with
language identification (LID) loss, (d) parallel encoder with an auxiliary loss
for monolingual projections. We conclude that in comparison to LID loss, our
proposed auxiliary loss is superior in specializing the parallel encoders to
respective monolingual locales, and that contributes to stronger bilingual
learning. We evaluate our work on large-scale training and test tasks for
bilingual Spanish (ES) and bilingual Italian (IT) applications. Our bilingual
models demonstrate strong English code-mixing capability. In particular, the
bilingual IT model improves the word error rate (WER) for a code-mix IT task
from 46.5% to 13.8%, while also achieving a close parity (9.6%) with the
monolingual IT model (9.5%) over IT tests.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid accessibility of portable and affordable retinal imaging devices
has made early differential diagnosis easier. For example, color funduscopy
imaging is readily available in remote villages, which can help to identify
diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, or pathological
myopia (PM). On the other hand, astronauts at the International Space Station
utilize this camera for identifying spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular
syndrome (SANS). However, due to the unavailability of experts in these
locations, the data has to be transferred to an urban healthcare facility (AMD
and glaucoma) or a terrestrial station (e.g, SANS) for more precise disease
identification. Moreover, due to low bandwidth limits, the imaging data has to
be compressed for transfer between these two places. Different super-resolution
algorithms have been proposed throughout the years to address this.
Furthermore, with the advent of deep learning, the field has advanced so much
that x2 and x4 compressed images can be decompressed to their original form
without losing spatial information. In this paper, we introduce a novel model
called Swin-FSR that utilizes Swin Transformer with spatial and depth-wise
attention for fundus image super-resolution. Our architecture achieves Peak
signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) of 47.89, 49.00 and 45.32 on three public
datasets, namely iChallenge-AMD, iChallenge-PM, and G1020. Additionally, we
tested the model's effectiveness on a privately held dataset for SANS provided
by NASA and achieved comparable results against previous architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune/antigen-mediated
esophageal disease, characterized by symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction
and histological evidence of eosinophil-dominant inflammation. Owing to the
intricate microscopic representation of EoE in imaging, current methodologies
which depend on manual identification are not only labor-intensive but also
prone to inaccuracies. In this study, we develop an open-source toolkit, named
Open-EoE, to perform end-to-end whole slide image (WSI) level eosinophil (Eos)
detection using one line of command via Docker. Specifically, the toolkit
supports three state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models.
Furthermore, Open-EoE further optimizes the performance by implementing an
ensemble learning strategy, and enhancing the precision and reliability of our
results. The experimental results demonstrated that the Open-EoE toolkit can
efficiently detect Eos on a testing set with 289 WSIs. At the widely accepted
threshold of &gt;= 15 Eos per high power field (HPF) for diagnosing EoE, the
Open-EoE achieved an accuracy of 91%, showing decent consistency with
pathologist evaluations. This suggests a promising avenue for integrating
machine learning methodologies into the diagnostic process for EoE. The docker
and source code has been made publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Layered Cellular Automata (LCA) extends the concept of traditional cellular
automata (CA) to model complex systems and phenomena. In LCA, each cell's next
state is determined by the interaction of two layers of computation, allowing
for more dynamic and realistic simulations. This thesis explores the design,
dynamics, and applications of LCA, with a focus on its potential in pattern
recognition and classification. The research begins by introducing the
limitations of traditional CA in capturing the complexity of real-world
systems. It then presents the concept of LCA, where layer 0 corresponds to a
predefined model, and layer 1 represents the proposed model with additional
influence. The interlayer rules, denoted as f and g, enable interactions not
only from adjacent neighboring cells but also from some far-away neighboring
cells, capturing long-range dependencies. The thesis explores various LCA
models, including those based on averaging, maximization, minimization, and
modified ECA neighborhoods. Additionally, the implementation of LCA on the 2-D
cellular automaton Game of Life is discussed, showcasing intriguing patterns
and behaviors. Through extensive experiments, the dynamics of different LCA
models are analyzed, revealing their sensitivity to rule changes and block size
variations. Convergent LCAs, which converge to fixed points from any initial
configuration, are identified and used to design a two-class pattern
classifier. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the competitive performance of
the LCA-based classifier against existing algorithms. Theoretical analysis of
LCA properties contributes to a deeper understanding of its computational
capabilities and behaviors. The research also suggests potential future
directions, such as exploring advanced LCA models, higher-dimensional
simulations, and hybrid approaches integrating LCA with other computational
models.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we propose using an over-the-air computation (OAC) scheme for
the federated k-means clustering algorithm to reduce the per-round
communication latency when it is implemented over a wireless network. The OAC
scheme relies on an encoder exploiting the representation of a number in a
balanced number system and computes the sum of the updates for the federated
k-means via signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels
non-coherently to eliminate the need for precise phase and time
synchronization. Also, a reinitialization method for ineffectively used
centroids is proposed to improve the performance of the proposed method for
heterogeneous data distribution. For a customer-location clustering scenario,
we demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it with
the standard k-means clustering. Our results show that the proposed approach
performs similarly to the standard k-means while reducing communication
latency.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have exhibited strong performance in
medical image segmentation tasks by capturing high-level (local) information,
such as edges and textures. However, due to the limited field of view of
convolution kernel, it is hard for CNNs to fully represent global information.
Recently, transformers have shown good performance for medical image
segmentation due to their ability to better model long-range dependencies.
Nevertheless, transformers struggle to capture high-level spatial features as
effectively as CNNs. A good segmentation model should learn a better
representation from local and global features to be both precise and
semantically accurate. In our previous work, we proposed CATS, which is a
U-shaped segmentation network augmented with transformer encoder. In this work,
we further extend this model and propose CATS v2 with hybrid encoders.
Specifically, hybrid encoders consist of a CNN-based encoder path paralleled to
a transformer path with a shifted window, which better leverage both local and
global information to produce robust 3D medical image segmentation. We fuse the
information from the convolutional encoder and the transformer at the skip
connections of different resolutions to form the final segmentation. The
proposed method is evaluated on two public challenge datasets: Cross-Modality
Domain Adaptation (CrossMoDA) and task 5 of Medical Segmentation Decathlon
(MSD-5), to segment vestibular schwannoma (VS) and prostate, respectively.
Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior
performance in terms of higher Dice scores.

<p class="mathjax">Research involving diverse but related data sets, where associations between
covariates and outcomes may vary, is prevalent in various fields including
agronomic studies. In these scenarios, hierarchical models, also known as
multilevel models, are frequently employed to assimilate information from
different data sets while accommodating their distinct characteristics.
However, their structure extend beyond simple heterogeneity, as variables often
form complex networks of causal relationships.
<br />Bayesian networks (BNs) provide a powerful framework for modelling such
relationships using directed acyclic graphs to illustrate the connections
between variables. This study introduces a novel approach that integrates
random effects into BN learning. Rooted in linear mixed-effects models, this
approach is particularly well-suited for handling hierarchical data. Results
from a real-world agronomic trial suggest that employing this approach enhances
structural learning, leading to the discovery of new connections and the
improvement of improved model specification. Furthermore, we observe a
reduction in prediction errors from 28\% to 17\%. By extending the
applicability of BNs to complex data set structures, this approach contributes
to the effective utilisation of BNs for hierarchical agronomic data. This, in
turn, enhances their value as decision-support tools in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Most of the existing disease prediction methods in the field of medical image
processing fall into two classes, namely image-to-category predictions and
image-to-parameter predictions. Few works have focused on image-to-image
predictions. Different from multi-horizon predictions in other fields,
ophthalmologists prefer to show more confidence in single-horizon predictions
due to the low tolerance of predictive risk. We propose a single-horizon
disease evolution network (SHENet) to predictively generate post-therapeutic
SD-OCT images by inputting pre-therapeutic SD-OCT images with neovascular
age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). In SHENet, a feature encoder converts
the input SD-OCT images to deep features, then a graph evolution module
predicts the process of disease evolution in high-dimensional latent space and
outputs the predicted deep features, and lastly, feature decoder recovers the
predicted deep features to SD-OCT images. We further propose an evolution
reinforcement module to ensure the effectiveness of disease evolution learning
and obtain realistic SD-OCT images by adversarial training. SHENet is validated
on 383 SD-OCT cubes of 22 nAMD patients based on three well-designed schemes
based on the quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared with other
generative methods, the generative SD-OCT images of SHENet have the highest
image quality. Besides, SHENet achieves the best structure protection and
content prediction. Qualitative evaluations also demonstrate that SHENet has a
better visual effect than other methods. SHENet can generate post-therapeutic
SD-OCT images with both high prediction performance and good image quality,
which has great potential to help ophthalmologists forecast the therapeutic
effect of nAMD.

<p class="mathjax">An accurate prostate delineation and volume characterization can support the
clinical assessment of prostate cancer. A large amount of automatic prostate
segmentation tools consider exclusively the axial MRI direction in spite of the
availability as per acquisition protocols of multi-view data. Further, when
multi-view data is exploited, manual annotations and availability at test time
for all the views is commonly assumed. In this work, we explore a contrastive
approach at training time to leverage multi-view data without annotations and
provide flexibility at deployment time in the event of missing views. We
propose a triplet encoder and single decoder network based on U-Net, tU-Net
(triplet U-Net). Our proposed architecture is able to exploit non-annotated
sagittal and coronal views via contrastive learning to improve the segmentation
from a volumetric perspective. For that purpose, we introduce the concept of
inter-view similarity in the latent space. To guide the training, we combine a
dice score loss calculated with respect to the axial view and its manual
annotations together with a multi-view contrastive loss. tU-Net shows
statistical improvement in dice score coefficient (DSC) with respect to only
axial view (91.25+-0.52% compared to 86.40+-1.50%,P&lt;.001). Sensitivity analysis
reveals the volumetric positive impact of the contrastive loss when paired with
tU-Net (2.85+-1.34% compared to 3.81+-1.88%,P&lt;.001). Further, our approach
shows good external volumetric generalization in an in-house dataset when
tested with multi-view data (2.76+-1.89% compared to 3.92+-3.31%,P=.002),
showing the feasibility of exploiting non-annotated multi-view data through
contrastive learning whilst providing flexibility at deployment in the event of
missing views.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches based on supervised learning
paradigms require large amounts of annotated data that are rarely available in
the medical domain. Unsupervised Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an
alternative that requires less annotated data. Further, OOD applications
exploit the class skewness commonly present in medical data. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) has proven to be useful for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and
management, but current DL approaches rely on T2w axial MRI, which suffers from
low out-of-plane resolution. We propose a multi-stream approach to accommodate
different T2w directions to improve the performance of PCa lesion detection in
an OOD approach. We evaluate our approach on a publicly available data-set,
obtaining better detection results in terms of AUC when compared to a single
direction approach (73.1 vs 82.3). Our results show the potential of OOD
approaches for PCa lesion detection based on MRI.

<p class="mathjax">Voice disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Surface
electromyography-based Silent Speech Interfaces (sEMG-based SSIs) have been
explored as a potential solution for decades. However, previous works were
limited by small vocabularies and manually extracted features from raw data. To
address these limitations, we propose a lightweight deep learning
knowledge-distilled ensemble model for sEMG-based SSI (KDE-SSI). Our model can
classify a 26 NATO phonetic alphabets dataset with 3900 data samples, enabling
the unambiguous generation of any English word through spelling. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of KDE-SSI, achieving a test accuracy of
85.9\%. Our findings also shed light on an end-to-end system for portable,
practical equipment.

<p class="mathjax">When labeled data is insufficient, semi-supervised learning with the
pseudo-labeling technique can significantly improve the performance of
automatic speech recognition. However, pseudo-labels are often noisy,
containing numerous incorrect tokens. Taking noisy labels as ground-truth in
the loss function results in suboptimal performance. Previous works attempted
to mitigate this issue by either filtering out the nosiest pseudo-labels or
improving the overall quality of pseudo-labels. While these methods are
effective to some extent, it is unrealistic to entirely eliminate incorrect
tokens in pseudo-labels. In this work, we propose a novel framework named
alternative pseudo-labeling to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo-labels from the
perspective of the training objective. The framework comprises several
components. Firstly, a generalized CTC loss function is introduced to handle
noisy pseudo-labels by accepting alternative tokens in the positions of
incorrect tokens. Applying this loss function in pseudo-labeling requires
detecting incorrect tokens in the predicted pseudo-labels. In this work, we
adopt a confidence-based error detection method that identifies the incorrect
tokens by comparing their confidence scores with a given threshold, thus
necessitating the confidence score to be discriminative. Hence, the second
proposed technique is the contrastive CTC loss function that widens the
confidence gap between the correctly and incorrectly predicted tokens, thereby
improving the error detection ability. Additionally, obtaining satisfactory
performance with confidence-based error detection typically requires extensive
threshold tuning. Instead, we propose an automatic thresholding method that
uses labeled data as a proxy for determining the threshold, thus saving the
pain of manual tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately detecting symbols transmitted over multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) wireless channels is crucial in realizing the benefits of MIMO
techniques. However, optimal MIMO detection is associated with a complexity
that grows exponentially with the MIMO dimensions and quickly becomes
impractical. Recently, stochastic sampling-based Bayesian inference techniques,
such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), have been combined with the gradient
descent (GD) method to provide a promising framework for MIMO detection. In
this work, we propose to efficiently approach optimal detection by exploring
the discrete search space via MCMC random walk accelerated by Nesterov's
gradient method. Nesterov's GD guides MCMC to make efficient searches without
the computationally expensive matrix inversion and line search. Our proposed
method operates using multiple GDs per random walk, achieving sufficient
descent towards important regions of the search space before adding random
perturbations, guaranteeing high sampling efficiency. To provide augmented
exploration, extra samples are derived through the trajectory of Nesterov's GD
by simple operations, effectively supplementing the sample list for statistical
inference and boosting the overall MIMO detection performance. Furthermore, we
design an early stopping tactic to terminate unnecessary further searches,
remarkably reducing the complexity. Simulation results and complexity analysis
reveal that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance in both
uncoded and coded MIMO systems, adapts to realistic channel models, and scales
well to large MIMO dimensions.

decomposition that expresses the latter as a Hadamard product of several tensor

for the density of such sets. Previously, the best known bound was
$O(1/\log^{*} n)$, which follows from the density Hales-Jewett theorem.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing promises potential for science and industry by solving
certain computationally complex problems faster than classical computers.
Quantum computing systems evolved from monolithic systems towards modular
architectures comprising multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) coupled to
classical computing nodes (HPC). With the increasing scale, middleware systems
that facilitate the efficient coupling of quantum-classical computing are
becoming critical. Through an in-depth analysis of quantum applications,
integration patterns and systems, we identified a gap in understanding
Quantum-HPC middleware systems. We present a conceptual middleware to
facilitate reasoning about quantum-classical integration and serve as the basis
for a future middleware system. An essential contribution of this paper lies in
leveraging well-established high-performance computing abstractions for
managing workloads, tasks, and resources to integrate quantum computing into
HPC systems seamlessly.

<p class="mathjax">Meta recently released SAM (Segment Anything Model) which is a
general-purpose segmentation model. SAM has shown promising results in a wide
variety of segmentation tasks including medical image segmentation. In the
field of medical image segmentation, polyp segmentation holds a position of
high importance, thus creating a model which is robust and precise is quite
challenging. Polyp segmentation is a fundamental task to ensure better
diagnosis and cure of colorectal cancer. As such in this study, we will see how
Polyp-SAM++, a text prompt-aided SAM, can better utilize a SAM using text
prompting for robust and more precise polyp segmentation. We will evaluate the
performance of a text-guided SAM on the polyp segmentation task on benchmark
datasets. We will also compare the results of text-guided SAM vs unprompted
SAM. With this study, we hope to advance the field of polyp segmentation and
inspire more, intriguing research. The code and other details will be made

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes DISQ to craft a stable landscape for VQA training and
tackle the noise drift challenge. DISQ adopts a "drift detector" with a
reference circuit to identify and skip iterations that are severely affected by
noise drift errors. Specifically, the circuits from the previous training
iteration are re-executed as a reference circuit in the current iteration to
estimate noise drift impacts. The iteration is deemed compromised by noise
drift errors and thus skipped if noise drift flips the direction of the ideal
optimization gradient. To enhance noise drift detection reliability, we further
propose to leverage multiple reference circuits from previous iterations to
provide a well founded judge of current noise drift. Nevertheless, multiple
reference circuits also introduce considerable execution overhead. To mitigate
extra overhead, we propose Pauli-term subsetting (prime and minor subsets) to
execute only observable circuits with large coefficient magnitudes (prime
subset) during drift detection. Only this minor subset is executed when the
current iteration is drift-free. Evaluations across various applications and
QPUs demonstrate that DISQ can mitigate a significant portion of the noise
drift impact on VQAs and achieve 1.51-2.24x fidelity improvement over the
traditional baseline. DISQ's benefit is 1.1-1.9x over the best alternative
approach while boosting average noise detection speed by 2.07x

<p class="mathjax">We show that the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), in combination
with some recently developed discontinuity capturing neural networks, can be
applied to solve optimal control problems subject to partial differential
equations (PDEs) with interfaces and some control constraints. The resulting
algorithm is mesh-free and scalable to different PDEs, and it ensures the
control constraints rigorously. Since the boundary and interface conditions, as
well as the PDEs, are all treated as soft constraints by lumping them into a
weighted loss function, it is necessary to learn them simultaneously and there
is no guarantee that the boundary and interface conditions can be satisfied
exactly. This immediately causes difficulties in tuning the weights in the
corresponding loss function and training the neural networks. To tackle these
difficulties and guarantee the numerical accuracy, we propose to impose the
boundary and interface conditions as hard constraints in PINNs by developing a
novel neural network architecture. The resulting hard-constraint PINNs approach
guarantees that both the boundary and interface conditions can be satisfied
exactly and they are decoupled from the learning of the PDEs. Its efficiency is
promisingly validated by some elliptic and parabolic interface optimal control
problems.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning is a very promising technique for low-dose computed tomography
(LDCT) image denoising. However, traditional deep learning methods require
paired noisy and clean datasets, which are often difficult to obtain. This
paper proposes a new method for performing LDCT image denoising with only LDCT
data, which means that normal-dose CT (NDCT) is not needed. We adopt a
combination including the self-supervised noise2noise model and the
noisy-as-clean strategy. First, we add a second yet similar type of noise to
LDCT images multiple times. Note that we use LDCT images based on the
noisy-as-clean strategy for corruption instead of NDCT images. Then, the
noise2noise model is executed with only the secondary corrupted images for
training. We select a modular U-Net structure from several candidates with
shared parameters to perform the task, which increases the receptive field
without increasing the parameter size. The experimental results obtained on the
Mayo LDCT dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with
that of state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The developed code is available
at https://github.com/XYuan01/Self-supervised-Noise2Noise-for-LDCT.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate tissue segmentation of thick-slice fetal brain magnetic resonance
(MR) scans is crucial for both reconstruction of isotropic brain MR volumes and
the quantification of fetal brain development. However, this task is
challenging due to the use of thick-slice scans in clinically-acquired fetal
brain data. To address this issue, we propose to leverage high-quality
isotropic fetal brain MR volumes (and also their corresponding annotations) as
guidance for segmentation of thick-slice scans. Due to existence of significant
domain gap between high-quality isotropic volume (i.e., source data) and
thick-slice scans (i.e., target data), we employ a domain adaptation technique
to achieve the associated knowledge transfer (from high-quality &lt;source&gt;
volumes to thick-slice &lt;target&gt; scans). Specifically, we first register the
available high-quality isotropic fetal brain MR volumes across different
gestational weeks to construct longitudinally-complete source data. To capture
domain-invariant information, we then perform Fourier decomposition to extract
image content and style codes. Finally, we propose a novel Cycle-Consistent
Domain Adaptation Network (C2DA-Net) to efficiently transfer the knowledge
learned from high-quality isotropic volumes for accurate tissue segmentation of
thick-slice scans. Our C2DA-Net can fully utilize a small set of annotated
isotropic volumes to guide tissue segmentation on unannotated thick-slice
scans. Extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset of 372 clinically
acquired thick-slice MR scans demonstrate that our C2DA-Net achieves much
better performance than cutting-edge methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning methods have shown remarkable performance in image denoising,
particularly when trained on large-scale paired datasets. However, acquiring
such paired datasets for real-world scenarios poses a significant challenge.
Although unsupervised approaches based on generative adversarial networks offer
a promising solution for denoising without paired datasets, they are difficult
in surpassing the performance limitations of conventional GAN-based
unsupervised frameworks without significantly modifying existing structures or
increasing the computational complexity of denoisers. To address this problem,
we propose a SC strategy for multiple denoisers. This strategy can achieve
significant performance improvement without increasing the inference complexity
of the GAN-based denoising framework. Its basic idea is to iteratively replace
the previous less powerful denoiser in the filter-guided noise extraction
module with the current powerful denoiser. This process generates better
synthetic clean-noisy image pairs, leading to a more powerful denoiser for the
next iteration. This baseline ensures the stability and effectiveness of the
training network. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our
method over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

for delivering blood to the brain. Understanding the diverse anatomical
variations and configurations of the CoW is paramount to advance research on
cerebrovascular diseases and refine clinical interventions. However,
comprehensive investigation of less prevalent CoW variations remains
challenging because of the dominance of a few commonly occurring
configurations. We propose a novel generative approach utilising a conditional
latent diffusion model with shape and anatomical guidance to generate realistic
3D CoW segmentations, including different phenotypical variations. Our
conditional latent diffusion model incorporates shape guidance to better
preserve vessel continuity and demonstrates superior performance when compared
to alternative generative models, including conditional variants of 3D GAN and
3D VAE. We observed that our model generated CoW variants that are more
realistic and demonstrate higher visual fidelity than competing approaches with
an FID score 53\% better than the best-performing GAN-based model.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum machine learning has the potential to enable advances in artificial
intelligence, such as solving problems intractable on classical computers. Some
fundamental ideas behind quantum machine learning are similar to kernel methods
in classical machine learning. Both process information by mapping it into
high-dimensional vector spaces without explicitly calculating their numerical
values. We explore a setup for performing classification on labeled classical
datasets, consisting of a classical neural network connected to a quantum
annealer. The neural network programs the quantum annealer's controls and
thereby maps the annealer's initial states into new states in the Hilbert
space. The neural network's parameters are optimized to maximize the distance
of states corresponding to inputs from different classes and minimize the
distance between quantum states corresponding to the same class. Recent
literature showed that at least some of the "learning" is due to the quantum
annealer, connecting a small linear network to a quantum annealer and using it
to learn small and linearly inseparable datasets. In this study, we consider a
similar but not quite the same case, where a classical fully-fledged neural
network is connected with a small quantum annealer. In such a setting, the
fully-fledged classical neural-network already has built-in nonlinearity and
learning power, and can already handle the classification problem alone, we
want to see whether an additional quantum layer could boost its performance. We
simulate this system to learn several common datasets, including those for
image and sound recognition. We conclude that adding a small quantum annealer
does not provide a significant benefit over just using a regular (nonlinear)
classical neural network.

<p class="mathjax">We analyze the popular ``state-space'' class of algorithms for detecting
casual interaction in coupled dynamical systems. These algorithms are often
justified by Takens' embedding theorem, which provides conditions under which
relationships involving attractors and their delay embeddings are continuous.
In practice, however, state-space methods often do not directly test
continuity, but rather the stronger property of how these relationships
preserve inter-point distances. This paper theoretically and empirically
explores state-space algorithms explicitly from the perspective of distance
preservation. We first derive basic theoretical guarantees applicable to simple
coupled systems, providing conditions under which the distance preservation of
a certain map reveals underlying causal structure. Second, we demonstrate
empirically that typical coupled systems do not satisfy distance preservation
assumptions. Taken together, our results underline the dependence of
state-space algorithms on intrinsic system properties and the relationship
between the system and the function used to measure it -- properties that are
not directly associated with causal interaction.

<p class="mathjax">Cartesian differential categories come equipped with a differential
combinator which axiomatizes the fundamental properties of the total derivative
from differential calculus. The objective of this paper is to understand when
the Kleisli category of a monad is a Cartesian differential category. We
introduce Cartesian differential monads, which are monads whose Kleisli
category is a Cartesian differential category by way of lifting the
differential combinator from the base category. Examples of Cartesian
differential monads include tangent bundle monads and reader monads. We give a
precise characterization of Cartesian differential categories which are Kleisli
categories of Cartesian differential monads using abstract Kleisli categories.
We also show that the Eilenberg-Moore category of a Cartesian differential
monad is a tangent category.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in generative speech models based on audio-text prompts
have enabled remarkable innovations like high-quality zero-shot text-to-speech.
However, existing models still face limitations in handling diverse audio-text
speech generation tasks involving transforming input speech and processing
audio captured in adverse acoustic conditions. This paper introduces SpeechX, a
versatile speech generation model capable of zero-shot TTS and various speech
transformation tasks, dealing with both clean and noisy signals. SpeechX
combines neural codec language modeling with multi-task learning using
task-dependent prompting, enabling unified and extensible modeling and
providing a consistent way for leveraging textual input in speech enhancement
and transformation tasks. Experimental results show SpeechX's efficacy in
various tasks, including zero-shot TTS, noise suppression, target speaker
extraction, speech removal, and speech editing with or without background
noise, achieving comparable or superior performance to specialized models
across tasks. See https://aka.ms/speechx for demo samples.

<p class="mathjax">Mutual fund categorization has become a standard tool for the investment
management industry and is extensively used by allocators for portfolio
construction and manager selection, as well as by fund managers for peer
analysis and competitive positioning. As a result, a (unintended)
miscategorization or lack of precision can significantly impact allocation
decisions and investment fund managers. Here, we aim to quantify the effect of
miscategorization of funds utilizing a machine learning based approach. We
formulate the problem of miscategorization of funds as a distance-based outlier
detection problem, where the outliers are the data-points that are far from the
rest of the data-points in the given feature space. We implement and employ a
Random Forest (RF) based method of distance metric learning, and compute the
so-called class-wise outlier measures for each data-point to identify outliers
in the data. We test our implementation on various publicly available data
sets, and then apply it to mutual fund data. We show that there is a strong
relationship between the outlier measures of the funds and their future returns
and discuss the implications of our findings.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks have shown impressive performance for image-based
disease detection. Performance is commonly evaluated through clinical
validation on independent test sets to demonstrate clinically acceptable
accuracy. Reporting good performance metrics on test sets, however, is not
always a sufficient indication of the generalizability and robustness of an
algorithm. In particular, when the test data is drawn from the same
distribution as the training data, the iid test set performance can be an
unreliable estimate of the accuracy on new data. In this paper, we employ
stress testing to assess model robustness and subgroup performance disparities
in disease detection models. We design progressive stress testing using five
different bidirectional and unidirectional image perturbations with six
different severity levels. As a use case, we apply stress tests to measure the
robustness of disease detection models for chest X-ray and skin lesion images,
and demonstrate the importance of studying class and domain-specific model
behaviour. Our experiments indicate that some models may yield more robust and
equitable performance than others. We also find that pretraining
characteristics play an important role in downstream robustness. We conclude
that progressive stress testing is a viable and important tool and should
become standard practice in the clinical validation of image-based disease
detection models.

<p class="mathjax">G\'acs' coarse-grained algorithmic entropy leverages universal computation to
quantify the information content of any given state. Unlike the Boltzmann and
Shannon-Gibbs entropies, it requires no prior commitment to a partition of
phase space or to probabilistic ensembles. Whereas earlier work had made loose
connections between the entropy of thermodynamic systems and
information-processing systems, the algorithmic entropy formally unifies them
both. For a close variant of G\'acs' definition, we prove a very general second
law of thermodynamics, and discuss its advantages over previous formulations.
Our law is a general property of Markov processes, which can be derived as
coarse-grainings of certain time-reversible dynamical systems. Finally, taking
inspiration from Maxwell's demon, we model an information engine powered by
compressible data.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of price comparison websites (PCWs) has presented insurers with
unique challenges in formulating effective pricing strategies. Operating on
PCWs requires insurers to strike a delicate balance between competitive
premiums and profitability, amidst obstacles such as low historical conversion
rates, limited visibility of competitors' actions, and a dynamic market
environment. In addition to this, the capital intensive nature of the business
means pricing below the risk levels of customers can result in solvency issues
for the insurer. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that learns the optimal pricing policy by
integrating model-based and model-free methods. The model-based component is
used to train agents in an offline setting, avoiding cold-start issues, while
model-free algorithms are then employed in a contextual bandit (CB) manner to
dynamically update the pricing policy to maximise the expected revenue. This
facilitates quick adaptation to evolving market dynamics and enhances algorithm
efficiency and decision interpretability. The paper also highlights the
importance of evaluating pricing policies using an offline dataset in a
consistent fashion and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed methodology
over existing off-the-shelf RL/CB approaches. We validate our methodology using
synthetic data, generated to reflect private commercially available data within
real-world insurers, and compare against 6 other benchmark approaches. Our
hybrid agent outperforms these benchmarks in terms of sample efficiency and
cumulative reward with the exception of an agent that has access to perfect
market information which would not be available in a real-world set-up.

<p class="mathjax">Automated segmentation of ultrasound images can assist medical experts with
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Although using the common modality of
ultrasound, one typically needs separate datasets in order to segment, for
example, different anatomical structures or lesions with different levels of
malignancy. In this paper, we consider the problem of jointly learning from
heterogeneous datasets so that the model can improve generalization abilities
by leveraging the inherent variability among datasets. We merge the
heterogeneous datasets into one dataset and refer to each component dataset as
a subgroup. We propose to train a single segmentation model so that the model
can adapt to each sub-group. For robust segmentation, we leverage recently
proposed Segment Anything model (SAM) in order to incorporate sub-group
information into the model. We propose SAM with Condition Embedding block
(CEmb-SAM) which encodes sub-group conditions and combines them with image
embeddings from SAM. The conditional embedding block effectively adapts SAM to
each image sub-group by incorporating dataset properties through learnable
parameters for normalization. Experiments show that CEmb-SAM outperforms the
baseline methods on ultrasound image segmentation for peripheral nerves and
breast cancer. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of Cemb-SAM in
learning from heterogeneous datasets in medical image segmentation tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Recent developments in deep learning (DL) techniques have led to great
performance improvement in medical image segmentation tasks, especially with
the latest Transformer model and its variants. While labels from fusing
multi-rater manual segmentations are often employed as ideal ground truths in
DL model training, inter-rater variability due to factors such as training
bias, image noise, and extreme anatomical variability can still affect the
performance and uncertainty of the resulting algorithms. Knowledge regarding
how inter-rater variability affects the reliability of the resulting DL
algorithms, a key element in clinical deployment, can help inform better
training data construction and DL models, but has not been explored
extensively. In this paper, we measure aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties
using test-time augmentation (TTA), test-time dropout (TTD), and deep ensemble
to explore their relationship with inter-rater variability. Furthermore, we
compare UNet and TransUNet to study the impacts of Transformers on model
uncertainty with two label fusion strategies. We conduct a case study using
multi-class paraspinal muscle segmentation from T2w MRIs. Our study reveals the
interplay between inter-rater variability and uncertainties, affected by
choices of label fusion strategies and DL models.

<p class="mathjax">This paper summarizes the music demixing (MDX) track of the Sound Demixing
Challenge (SDX'23). We provide a summary of the challenge setup and introduce
the task of robust music source separation (MSS), i.e., training MSS models in
the presence of errors in the training data. We propose a formalization of the
errors that can occur in the design of a training dataset for MSS systems and
introduce two new datasets that simulate such errors: SDXDB23_LabelNoise and
SDXDB23_Bleeding1. We describe the methods that achieved the highest scores in
the competition. Moreover, we present a direct comparison with the previous
edition of the challenge (the Music Demixing Challenge 2021): the best
performing system under the standard MSS formulation achieved an improvement of
over 1.6dB in signal-to-distortion ratio over the winner of the previous
competition, when evaluated on MDXDB21. Besides relying on the
signal-to-distortion ratio as objective metric, we also performed a listening
test with renowned producers/musicians to study the perceptual quality of the
systems and report here the results. Finally, we provide our insights into the
organization of the competition and our prospects for future editions.

<p class="mathjax">Predictive maintenance plays a critical role in ensuring the uninterrupted
operation of industrial systems and mitigating the potential risks associated
with system failures. This study focuses on sensor-based condition monitoring
and explores the application of deep learning techniques using a hydraulic
system testbed dataset. Our investigation involves comparing the performance of
three models: a baseline model employing conventional methods, a single CNN
model with early sensor fusion, and a two-lane CNN model (2L-CNN) with late
sensor fusion. The baseline model achieves an impressive test error rate of 1%
by employing late sensor fusion, where feature extraction is performed
individually for each sensor. However, the CNN model encounters challenges due
to the diverse sensor characteristics, resulting in an error rate of 20.5%. To
further investigate this issue, we conduct separate training for each sensor
and observe variations in accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of the 2L-CNN model, which demonstrates significant improvement by reducing the
error rate by 33% when considering the combination of the least and most
optimal sensors. This study underscores the importance of effectively
addressing the complexities posed by multi-sensor systems in sensor-based
condition monitoring.

<p class="mathjax">Brain extraction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is an important
segmentation step in many neuroimaging preprocessing pipelines. Image
segmentation is one of the research fields in which deep learning had the
biggest impact in recent years enabling high precision segmentation with
minimal compute. Consequently, traditional brain extraction methods are now
being replaced by deep learning-based methods. Here, we used a unique dataset
comprising 568 T1-weighted (T1w) MR images from 191 different studies in
combination with cutting edge deep learning methods to build a fast,
high-precision brain extraction tool called deepbet. deepbet uses LinkNet, a
modern UNet architecture, in a two stage prediction process. This increases its
segmentation performance, setting a novel state-of-the-art performance during
cross-validation with a median Dice score (DSC) of 99.0% on unseen datasets,
outperforming current state of the art models (DSC = 97.8% and DSC = 97.9%).
While current methods are more sensitive to outliers, resulting in Dice scores
as low as 76.5%, deepbet manages to achieve a Dice score of &gt; 96.9% for all
samples. Finally, our model accelerates brain extraction by a factor of ~10
compared to current methods, enabling the processing of one image in ~2 seconds
on low level hardware.

<p class="mathjax">Standard online change point detection (CPD) methods tend to have large false
discovery rates as their detections are sensitive to outliers. To overcome this
drawback, we propose Greedy Online Change Point Detection (GOCPD), a
computationally appealing method which finds change points by maximizing the
probability of the data coming from the (temporal) concatenation of two
independent models. We show that, for time series with a single change point,
this objective is unimodal and thus CPD can be accelerated via ternary search
with logarithmic complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GOCPD on
synthetic data and validate our findings on real-world univariate and
multivariate settings.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting which proteins interact together from amino-acid sequences is an
important task. We develop a method to pair interacting protein sequences which
leverages the power of protein language models trained on multiple sequence
alignments, such as MSA Transformer and the EvoFormer module of AlphaFold. We
formulate the problem of pairing interacting partners among the paralogs of two
protein families in a differentiable way. We introduce a method called DiffPALM
that solves it by exploiting the ability of MSA Transformer to fill in masked
amino acids in multiple sequence alignments using the surrounding context. MSA
Transformer encodes coevolution between functionally or structurally coupled
amino acids. We show that it captures inter-chain coevolution, while it was
trained on single-chain data, which means that it can be used
out-of-distribution. Relying on MSA Transformer without fine-tuning, DiffPALM
outperforms existing coevolution-based pairing methods on difficult benchmarks
of shallow multiple sequence alignments extracted from ubiquitous prokaryotic
protein datasets. It also outperforms an alternative method based on a
state-of-the-art protein language model trained on single sequences. Paired
alignments of interacting protein sequences are a crucial ingredient of
supervised deep learning methods to predict the three-dimensional structure of
protein complexes. DiffPALM substantially improves the structure prediction of
some eukaryotic protein complexes by AlphaFold-Multimer, without significantly
deteriorating any of those we tested. It also achieves competitive performance
with using orthology-based pairing.

<p class="mathjax">Although automatic emotion recognition (AER) has recently drawn significant
research interest, most current AER studies use manually segmented utterances,
which are usually unavailable for dialogue systems. This paper proposes
integrating AER with automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarisation
(SD) in a jointly-trained system. Distinct output layers are built for four
sub-tasks including AER, ASR, voice activity detection and speaker
classification based on a shared encoder. Taking the audio of a conversation as
input, the integrated system finds all speech segments and transcribes the
corresponding emotion classes, word sequences, and speaker identities. Two
metrics are proposed to evaluate AER performance with automatic segmentation
based on time-weighted emotion and speaker classification errors. Results on
the IEMOCAP dataset show that the proposed system consistently outperforms two
baselines with separately trained single-task systems on AER, ASR and SD.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) serves as a fundamental model for semantic
segmentation and demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities across a
wide range of downstream scenarios. In this empirical study, we examine SAM's
robustness and zero-shot generalizability in the field of robotic surgery. We
comprehensively explore different scenarios, including prompted and unprompted
situations, bounding box and points-based prompt approaches, as well as the
ability to generalize under corruptions and perturbations at five severity
levels. Additionally, we compare the performance of SAM with state-of-the-art
supervised models. We conduct all the experiments with two well-known robotic
instrument segmentation datasets from MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and 2018 challenges.
Our extensive evaluation results reveal that although SAM shows remarkable
zero-shot generalization ability with bounding box prompts, it struggles to
segment the whole instrument with point-based prompts and unprompted settings.
Furthermore, our qualitative figures demonstrate that the model either failed
to predict certain parts of the instrument mask (e.g., jaws, wrist) or
predicted parts of the instrument as wrong classes in the scenario of
overlapping instruments within the same bounding box or with the point-based
prompt. In fact, SAM struggles to identify instruments in complex surgical
scenarios characterized by the presence of blood, reflection, blur, and shade.
Additionally, SAM is insufficiently robust to maintain high performance when
subjected to various forms of data corruption. We also attempt to fine-tune SAM
using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) and propose SurgicalSAM, which shows the
capability in class-wise mask prediction without prompt. Therefore, we can
argue that, without further domain-specific fine-tuning, SAM is not ready for
downstream surgical tasks.

novel ensemble approach using ONet and modified versions of UNet, coupled with
innovative loss functions, this study achieves a precise segmentation model for
the BraTS-PEDs 2023 Challenge. Data augmentation, including both single and
composite transformations, ensures model robustness and accuracy across
different scanning protocols. The ensemble strategy, integrating the ONet and
UNet models, shows greater effectiveness in capturing specific features and
modeling diverse aspects of the MRI images which result in lesion_wise dice
scores of 0.52, 0.72 and 0.78 for enhancing tumor, tumor core and whole tumor
labels respectively. Visual comparisons further confirm the superiority of the
ensemble method in accurate tumor region coverage. The results indicate that
this advanced ensemble approach, building upon the unique strengths of
individual models, offers promising prospects for enhanced diagnostic accuracy
and effective treatment planning for brain tumors in pediatric brains.

<p class="mathjax">Brain tumors, particularly glioblastoma, continue to challenge medical
diagnostics and treatments globally. This paper explores the application of
deep learning to multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for
enhanced brain tumor segmentation precision in the Sub-Saharan Africa patient
population. We introduce an ensemble method that comprises eleven unique
variations based on three core architectures: UNet3D, ONet3D, SphereNet3D and
modified loss functions. The study emphasizes the need for both age- and
population-based segmentation models, to fully account for the complexities in
the brain. Our findings reveal that the ensemble approach, combining different
architectures, outperforms single models, leading to improved evaluation
metrics. Specifically, the results exhibit Dice scores of 0.82, 0.82, and 0.87
for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor labels respectively. These
results underline the potential of tailored deep learning techniques in
precisely segmenting brain tumors and lay groundwork for future work to
fine-tune models and assess performance across different brain regions.

<p class="mathjax">We develop a compositional theory of nonlinear audio signal processing based
on a categorification of the Volterra series. We augment the classical
definition of the Volterra series to be functorial with respect to a base
category whose objects are temperate distributions and whose morphisms are
certain linear transformations. This leads to formulae describing how the
outcomes of nonlinear transformations are affected if their input signals are
first linearly processed. We then consider how nonlinear audio systems change,
and introduce as a model thereof the notion of morphism of Volterra series. We
show how morphisms can be parameterized and used to generate indexed families
of Volterra series, which are well-suited to model nonstationary or
time-varying nonlinear phenomena. We describe how Volterra series and their
morphisms organize into a functor category, Volt, whose objects are Volterra
series and whose morphisms are natural transformations. We exhibit the
operations of sum, product, and series composition of Volterra series as
monoidal products on Volt and identify, for each in turn, its corresponding
universal property. We show, in particular, that the series composition of
Volterra series is associative. We then bridge between our framework and a
subject at the heart of audio signal processing: time-frequency analysis.
Specifically, we show that an equivalence between a certain class of
second-order Volterra series and the bilinear time-frequency distributions
(TFDs) can be extended to one between certain higher-order Volterra series and
the so-called polynomial TFDs. We end with prospects for future work, including
the incorporation of nonlinear system identification techniques and the
extension of our theory to the settings of compositional graph and topological
audio signal processing.

<p class="mathjax">We describe SH-SVL, a parameterized family of first-order distributed
optimization algorithms that enable a network of agents to collaboratively
calculate a decision variable that minimizes the sum of cost functions at each
agent. These algorithms are self-healing in that their convergence to the
correct optimizer can be guaranteed even if they are initialized randomly,
agents join or leave the network, or local cost functions change. We also
present simulation evidence that our algorithms are self-healing in the case of
dropped communication packets. Our algorithms are the first single-Laplacian
methods for distributed convex optimization to exhibit all of these
characteristics. We achieve self-healing by sacrificing internal stability, a
fundamental trade-off for single-Laplacian methods.

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformers are effective deep learning models for vision tasks,
including medical image segmentation. However, they lack efficiency and
translational invariance, unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To model
long-range interactions in 3D brain lesion segmentation, we propose an
all-convolutional transformer block variant of the U-Net architecture. We
demonstrate that our model provides the greatest compromise in three factors:
performance competitive with the state-of-the-art; parameter efficiency of a
CNN; and the favourable inductive biases of a transformer. Our public
implementation is available at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/MDUNet .

<p class="mathjax">The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms are crucial in
localizing acoustic sources. Traditional localization methods rely on
block-level processing to extract the directional information from multiple
measurements processed together. However, these methods assume that DOA remains
constant throughout the block, which may not be true in practical scenarios.
Also, the performance of localization methods is limited when the true
parameters do not lie on the parameter search grid. In this paper we propose
two trajectory models, namely the polynomial and bandlimited trajectory models,
to capture the DOA dynamics. To estimate trajectory parameters, we adopt two
gridless algorithms: i) Sliding Frank-Wolfe (SFW), which solves the Beurling
LASSO problem and ii) Newtonized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (NOMP), which
improves over OMP using cyclic refinement. Furthermore, we extend our analysis
to include wideband processing. The simulation results indicate that the
proposed trajectory localization algorithms exhibit improved performance
compared to grid-based methods in terms of resolution, robustness to noise, and
computational efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Cluster synchronization is of paramount importance for the normal functioning
of numerous technological and natural systems. Deviations from normal cluster
synchronization patterns are closely associated with various malfunctions, such
as neurological disorders in the brain. Therefore, it is crucial to restore
normal system functions by stabilizing the appropriate cluster synchronization
patterns. Most existing studies focus on designing controllers based on state
measurements to achieve system stabilization. However, in many real-world
scenarios, measuring system states, such as neuronal activity in the brain,
poses significant challenges, rendering the stabilization of such systems
difficult. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we employ an open-loop
control strategy, vibrational control, which does not requires any state
measurements. We establish some sufficient conditions under which vibrational
inputs stabilize cluster synchronization. Further, we provide a tractable
approach to design vibrational control. Finally, numerical experiments are
conducted to demonstrate our theoretical findings.
