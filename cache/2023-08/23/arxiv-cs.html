<p class="mathjax">There has been many papers in academic literature on quantizing weight
tensors in deep learning models to reduce inference latency and memory
footprint. TVM also has the ability to quantize weights and support low-bit
computations. Although quantization is typically expected to improve inference
time, in TVM, the performance of 8-bit quantization does not meet the
expectations. Typically, when applying 8-bit quantization to a deep learning
model, it is usually expected to achieve around 50% of the full-precision
inference time. However, in this particular case, not only does the quantized
version fail to achieve the desired performance boost, but it actually performs
worse, resulting in an inference time that is about 2 times as slow as the
non-quantized version. In this project, we thoroughly investigate the reasons
behind the underperformance and assess the compatibility and optimization
opportunities of 8-bit quantization in TVM. We discuss the optimization of two
different types of tasks: computation-bound and memory-bound, and provide a
detailed comparison of various optimization techniques in TVM. Through the
identification of performance issues, we have successfully improved
quantization by addressing a bug in graph building. Furthermore, we analyze
multiple optimization strategies to achieve the optimal quantization result.
The best experiment achieves 163.88% improvement compared with the TVM compiled
baseline in inference time for the compute-bound task and 194.98% for the
memory-bound task.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Machine Learning (ML) has become a widely accepted method for
significant progress that is rapidly evolving. Since it employs computational
methods to teach machines and produce acceptable answers. The significance of
the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) methods, which can provide acceptable
answers for such problems, is examined in this study. To assist in the creation
of software that is simple to use, the authors research MLOps methods. To
choose the best tool structure for certain projects, the authors also assess
the features and operability of various MLOps methods. A total of 22 papers
were assessed that attempted to apply the MLOps idea. Finally, the authors
admit the scarcity of fully effective MLOps methods based on which advancements
can self-regulate by limiting human engagement.

<p class="mathjax">Emergence is a pregnant property in various fields. It is the fact for a
phenomenon to appear surprisingly and to be such that it seems at first sight
that it is not possible to predict its apparition. That is the reason why it
has often been said that emergence is a subjective property relative to the
observer. Some mathematical systems having very simple and deterministic rules
nevertheless show emergent behavior. Studying these systems shed a new light on
the subject and allows to define a new concept, computational irreducibility,
which deals with behaviors that even though they are totally deterministic
cannot be predicted without simulating them. Computational irreducibility is
then a key for understanding emergent phenomena from an objective point of view
that does not need the mention of any observer.

<p class="mathjax">Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning process that
transforms raw data into a more usable format for downstream ML models.
However, it can be costly and time-consuming, often requiring the expertise of
domain experts. Existing automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks claim
to automate data preprocessing. However, they often use a restricted search
space of data preprocessing pipelines which limits the potential performance
gains, and they are often too slow as they require training the ML model
multiple times. In this paper, we propose DiffPrep, a method that can
automatically and efficiently search for a data preprocessing pipeline for a
given tabular dataset and a differentiable ML model such that the performance
of the ML model is maximized. We formalize the problem of data preprocessing
pipeline search as a bi-level optimization problem. To solve this problem
efficiently, we transform and relax the discrete, non-differential search space
into a continuous and differentiable one, which allows us to perform the
pipeline search using gradient descent with training the ML model only once.
Our experiments show that DiffPrep achieves the best test accuracy on 15 out of
the 18 real-world datasets evaluated and improves the model's test accuracy by
up to 6.6 percentage points.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
results on various generative tasks.Despite its promises, the learned
representations of pre-trained DPMs, however, have not been fully understood.
In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the representation power
of DPMs, and propose a novel knowledge transfer method that leverages the
knowledge acquired by generative DPMs for recognition tasks. Our study begins
by examining the feature space of DPMs, revealing that DPMs are inherently
denoising autoencoders that balance the representation learning with
regularizing model capacity. To this end, we introduce a novel knowledge
transfer paradigm named RepFusion. Our paradigm extracts representations at
different time steps from off-the-shelf DPMs and dynamically employs them as
supervision for student networks, in which the optimal time is determined
through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach on several image
classification, semantic segmentation, and landmark detection benchmarks, and
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our results uncover
the potential of DPMs as a powerful tool for representation learning and
provide insights into the usefulness of generative models beyond sample
generation. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Graph anomaly detection has attracted considerable attention in recent years.
This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages metapath-based
semi-supervised learning, addressing the limitations of previous methods. We
present a new framework, Metapath-based Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection
(MSAD), incorporating GCN layers in both the encoder and decoder to efficiently
propagate context information between abnormal and normal nodes. The design of
metapath-based context information and a specifically crafted anomaly community
enhance the process of learning differences in structures and attributes, both
globally and locally. Through a comprehensive set of experiments conducted on
seven real-world networks, this paper demonstrates the superiority of the MSAD
method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The promising results of this
study pave the way for future investigations, focusing on the optimization and
analysis of metapath patterns to further enhance the effectiveness of anomaly
detection on attributed networks.

<p class="mathjax">Information and knowledge leakage has become a significant security risk to
Australian organizations. Each security incident in Australian business cost an
average US$\$$2.8 million. Furthermore, Australian organisations spend the
second most worldwide (US$\$$1.2 million each on average) on investigating and
assessing information breaches. The leakage of sensitive organizational
information occurs through different avenues, such as social media, cloud
computing and mobile devices. In this study, we (1) analyze the knowledge
leakage risk (KLR) caused by the use of mobile devices in knowledge-intensive
Australian organizations, (2) present a conceptual research model to explain
the determinants that influence KLR through the use of mobile devices grounded
in the literature, (3) conduct interviews with security and knowledge managers
to understand what strategies they use to mitigate KLR caused by the use of
mobile devices and (4) use content analysis and the conceptual model to frame
the preliminary findings from the interviews. Keywords: Knowledge leakage,
mobile devices, mobile contexts, knowledge leakage risk

<p class="mathjax">String data is common in real-world datasets: 67.6% of values in a sample of
1.8 million real Excel spreadsheets from the web were represented as text.
Systems that successfully clean such string data can have a significant impact
on real users. While prior work has explored errors in string data, proposed
approaches have often been limited to error detection or require that the user
provide annotations, examples, or constraints to fix the errors. Furthermore,
these systems have focused independently on syntactic errors or semantic errors
in strings, but ignore that strings often contain both syntactic and semantic
substrings. We introduce DataVinci, a fully unsupervised string data error
detection and repair system. DataVinci learns regular-expression-based patterns
that cover a majority of values in a column and reports values that do not
satisfy such patterns as data errors. DataVinci can automatically derive edits
to the data error based on the majority patterns and constraints learned over
other columns without the need for further user interaction. To handle strings
with both syntactic and semantic substrings, DataVinci uses an LLM to abstract
(and re-concretize) portions of strings that are semantic prior to learning
majority patterns and deriving edits. Because not all data can result in
majority patterns, DataVinci leverages execution information from an existing
program (which reads the target data) to identify and correct data repairs that
would not otherwise be identified. DataVinci outperforms 7 baselines on both
error detection and repair when evaluated on 4 existing and new benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Although compartmental dynamical systems are used in many different areas of
science, model selection based on the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) is
challenging because of the lack of methods for quantifying the entropy for this
type of systems. Here, we take advantage of the interpretation of compartmental
systems as continuous-time Markov chains to obtain entropy measures that
quantify model information content. In particular, we quantify the uncertainty
of a single particle's path as it travels through the system as described by
path entropy and entropy rates. Path entropy measures the uncertainty of the
entire path of a traveling particle from its entry into the system until its
exit, whereas entropy rates measure the average uncertainty of the
instantaneous future of a particle while it is in the system. We derive
explicit formulas for these two types of entropy for compartmental systems in
equilibrium based on Shannon information entropy and show how they can be used
to solve equifinality problems in the process of model selection by means of
MaxEnt.

mixed precision approach. However, these formats show a significant gap in
storage (and accuracy), e.g. between half, single and double precision. We
therefore look beyond these standard formats and use adaptive compression for
storing the lowrank and dense data and investigate how that affects the
arithmetic of such matrices.

<p class="mathjax">While network slicing has become a prevalent approach to service
differentiation, radio access network (RAN) slicing remains challenging due to
the need of substantial adaptivity and flexibility to cope with the highly
dynamic network environment in RANs. In this paper, we develop a slicing-based
resource management framework for a two-tier RAN to support multiple services
with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. The developed framework
focuses on base station (BS) service coverage (SC) and interference management
for multiple slices, each of which corresponds to a service. New designs are
introduced in the spatial, temporal, and slice dimensions to cope with
spatiotemporal variations in data traffic, balance adaptivity and overhead of
resource management, and enhance flexibility in service differentiation. Based
on the proposed framework, an energy efficiency maximization problem is
formulated, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted approach is proposed
to solve the problem. Specifically, a deep unsupervised learning-assisted
algorithm is proposed for searching the optimal SC of the BSs, and an
optimization-based analytical solution is found for managing interference among
BSs. Simulation results under different data traffic distributions demonstrate
that our proposed slicing-based resource management framework, empowered by the
AI-assisted approach, outperforms the benchmark frameworks and achieves a
close-to-optimal performance in energy efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Selecting robot design parameters can be challenging since these parameters
are often coupled with the performance of the controller and, therefore, the
resulting capabilities of the robot. This leads to a time-consuming and often
expensive process whereby one iterates between designing the robot and manually
evaluating its capabilities. This is particularly challenging for bipedal
robots, where it can be difficult to evaluate the behavior of the system due to
the underlying nonlinear and hybrid dynamics. Thus, in an effort to streamline
the design process of bipedal robots, and maximize their performance, this
paper presents a systematic framework for the co-design of humanoid robots and
their associated walking gaits. To this end, we leverage the framework of
hybrid zero dynamic (HZD) gait generation, which gives a formal approach to the
generation of dynamic walking gaits. The key novelty of this paper is to
consider both virtual constraints associated with the actuators of the robot,
coupled with design virtual constraints that encode the associated parameters
of the robot to be designed. These virtual constraints are combined in an HZD
optimization problem which simultaneously determines the design parameters
while finding a stable walking gait that minimizes a given cost function. The
proposed approach is demonstrated through the design of a novel humanoid robot,
ADAM, wherein its thigh and shin are co-designed so as to yield energy
efficient bipedal locomotion.

<p class="mathjax">Embedded Network Stacks (ENS) enable low-resource devices to communicate with
the outside world, facilitating the development of the Internet of Things and
Cyber-Physical Systems. Some defects in ENS are thus high-severity
cybersecurity vulnerabilities: they are remotely triggerable and can impact the
physical world. While prior research has shed light on the characteristics of
defects in many classes of software systems, no study has described the
properties of ENS defects nor identified a systematic technique to expose them.
The most common automated approach to detecting ENS defects is feedback-driven
randomized dynamic analysis ("fuzzing"), a costly and unpredictable technique.
<br />This paper provides the first systematic characterization of cybersecurity
vulnerabilities in ENS. We analyzed 61 vulnerabilities across 6 open-source
ENS. Most of these ENS defects are concentrated in the transport and network
layers of the network stack, require reaching different states in the network
protocol, and can be triggered by only 1-2 modifications to a single packet. We
therefore propose a novel systematic testing framework that focuses on the
transport and network layers, uses seeds that cover a network protocol's
states, and systematically modifies packet fields. We evaluated this framework
on 4 ENS and replicated 12 of the 14 reported IP/TCP/UDP vulnerabilities. On
recent versions of these ENSs, it discovered 7 novel defects (6 assigned CVES)
during a bounded systematic test that covered all protocol states and made up
to 3 modifications per packet. We found defects in 3 of the 4 ENS we tested
that had not been found by prior fuzzing research. Our results suggest that
fuzzing should be deferred until after systematic testing is employed.

<p class="mathjax">We present an approach to ensure safe and deadlock-free navigation for
decentralized multi-robot systems operating in constrained environments,
including doorways and intersections. Although many solutions have been
proposed to ensure safety, preventing deadlocks in a decentralized fashion with
global consensus remains an open problem. We first formalize the objective as a
non-cooperative, non-communicative, partially observable multi-robot navigation
problem in constrained spaces with multiple conflicting agents, which we term
as social mini-games. Our approach to ensuring safety and liveness rests on two
novel insights: (i) deadlock resolution is equivalent to deriving a mixed-Nash
equilibrium solution to a social mini-game and (ii) this mixed-Nash strategy
can be interpreted as an analogue to control barrier functions (CBFs), that can
then be integrated with standard CBFs, inheriting their safety guarantees.
Together, the standard CBF along with the mixed-Nash CBF analogue preserves
both safety and liveness. We evaluate our proposed game-theoretic navigation
algorithm in simulation as well on physical robots using F1/10 robots, a
Clearpath Jackal, as well as a Boston Dynamics Spot in a doorway, corridor
intersection, roundabout, and hallway scenario. We show that (i) our approach
results in safer and more efficient navigation compared to local planners based
on geometrical constraints, optimization, multi-agent reinforcement learning,
and auctions, (ii) our deadlock resolution strategy is the smoothest in terms
of smallest average change in velocity and path deviation, and most efficient
in terms of makespan (iii) our approach yields a flow rate of 2.8 - 3.3
(ms)^{-1 which is comparable to flow rate in human navigation at 4 (ms)^{-1}.

<p class="mathjax">Recent works have demonstrated success in MRI reconstruction using deep
learning-based models. However, most reported approaches require training on a
task-specific, large-scale dataset. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a
general pipeline which embeds a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction.
The potential of RED has been demonstrated for multiple image-related tasks
such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a
regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the
priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. This enables RNST to
reconstruct a high-quality image from a noisy low-quality image with different
image styles and limited data. We validate RNST with clinical MRI scans from
1.5T and 3T and show that RNST can significantly boost image quality. Our
results highlight the capability of the RNST framework for MRI reconstruction
and the potential for reconstruction tasks with limited data.

<p class="mathjax">Future wireless networks need to support the increasing demands for high data
rates and improved coverage. One promising solution is sectorization, where an
infrastructure node (e.g., a base station) is equipped with multiple sectors
employing directional communication. Although the concept of sectorization is
not new, it is critical to fully understand the potential of sectorized
networks, such as the rate gain achieved when multiple sectors can be
simultaneously activated. In this paper, we focus on sectorized wireless
networks, where sectorized infrastructure nodes with beam-steering capabilities
form a multi-hop mesh network for data forwarding and routing. We present a
sectorized node model and characterize the capacity region of these sectorized
networks. We define the flow extension ratio and the corresponding
sectorization gain, which quantitatively measure the performance gain
introduced by node sectorization as a function of the network flow. Our
objective is to find the optimal sectorization of each node that achieves the
maximum flow extension ratio, and thus the sectorization gain. Towards this
goal, we formulate the corresponding optimization problem and develop an
efficient distributed algorithm that obtains the node sectorization under a
given network flow with an approximation ratio of 2/3. Through extensive
simulations, we evaluate the sectorization gain and the performance of the
proposed algorithm in various network scenarios with varying network flows. The
simulation results show that the approximate sectorization gain increases
sublinearly as a function of the number of sectors per node.

<p class="mathjax">Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection has developed substantially in the past
few years, with available methods approaching, and in a few cases achieving,
perfect data separation on standard benchmarks. These results generally involve
large or complex models, pretraining, exposure to OoD examples or extra
hyperparameter tuning. Remarkably, it is possible to achieve results that can
exceed many of these state-of-the-art methods with a very simple method. We
demonstrate that ResNet18 trained with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL)
produces state-of-the-art results out-of-the-box on near and far OoD detection
benchmarks using only Euclidean distance as a scoring rule. This may obviate
the need in some cases for more sophisticated methods or larger models, and at
the very least provides a very strong, easy to use baseline for further
experimentation and analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Firm competition and collusion involve complex dynamics, particularly when
considering communication among firms. Such issues can be modeled as problems
of complex systems, traditionally approached through experiments involving
human subjects or agent-based modeling methods. We propose an innovative
framework called Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM), wherein smart agents,
supported by GPT-4 technologies, represent firms, and interact with one
another. We conducted a controlled experiment to study firm price competition
and collusion behaviors under various conditions. SABM is more cost-effective
and flexible compared to conducting experiments with human subjects. Smart
agents possess an extensive knowledge base for decision-making and exhibit
human-like strategic abilities, surpassing traditional ABM agents. Furthermore,
smart agents can simulate human conversation and be personalized, making them
ideal for studying complex situations involving communication. Our results
demonstrate that, in the absence of communication, smart agents consistently
reach tacit collusion, leading to prices converging at levels higher than the
Bertrand equilibrium price but lower than monopoly or cartel prices. When
communication is allowed, smart agents achieve a higher-level collusion with
prices close to cartel prices. Collusion forms more quickly with communication,
while price convergence is smoother without it. These results indicate that
communication enhances trust between firms, encouraging frequent small price
deviations to explore opportunities for a higher-level win-win situation and
reducing the likelihood of triggering a price war. We also assigned different
personas to firms to analyze behavioral differences and tested variant models
under diverse market structures. The findings showcase the effectiveness and
robustness of SABM and provide intriguing insights into competition and
collusion.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models can perform well in complex medical imaging
classification tasks, even when basing their conclusions on spurious
correlations (i.e. confounders), should they be prevalent in the training
dataset, rather than on the causal image markers of interest. This would
thereby limit their ability to generalize across the population. Explainability
based on counterfactual image generation can be used to expose the confounders
but does not provide a strategy to mitigate the bias. In this work, we
introduce the first end-to-end training framework that integrates both (i)
popular debiasing classifiers (e.g. distributionally robust optimization (DRO))
to avoid latching onto the spurious correlations and (ii) counterfactual image
generation to unveil generalizable imaging markers of relevance to the task.
Additionally, we propose a novel metric, Spurious Correlation Latching Score
(SCLS), to quantify the extent of the classifier reliance on the spurious
correlation as exposed by the counterfactual images. Through comprehensive
experiments on two public datasets (with the simulated and real visual
artifacts), we demonstrate that the debiasing method: (i) learns generalizable
markers across the population, and (ii) successfully ignores spurious
correlations and focuses on the underlying disease pathology.

This algorithm can be seen as a generalization of Hadlock algorithm to G8
grids, and is shown to be theoretically equivalent to the relaxed $A^*$
($RA^*$) algorithm in terms of the provided solution's path length, but with
substantial time and memory savings, due to a completely different computation
strategy, based on defining a set of lookup matrices. Through an experimental
study on grid maps of various types and sizes (1290 runs on 43 maps), it is
proven to be 2.25 times faster than $RA^*$ and 17 times faster than the
original $A^*$, in average. Moreover, it is more memory-efficient, since it

quality. Here, a pixel-free method called the flashlight search medial axis
(FSMA) algorithm is proposed for pore-network extraction in a continuous space.
The search domain in a two-dimensional space is a line, whereas a surface
domain is searched in a three-dimensional scenario. Thus, the FSMA algorithm
follows the dimensionality reduction idea; the medial axis can be identified
using only a few points instead of calculating every point in the void space.
In this way, computational complexity of this method is greatly reduced
compared to that of traditional pixel-based extraction methods, thus enabling
large-scale pore-network extraction. Based on cases featuring two- and
three-dimensional porous media, the FSMA algorithm performs well regardless of
the topological structure of the pore network or the positions of the pore and
throat centers. This algorithm can also be used to examine both closed- and
open-boundary cases. Finally, the FSMA algorithm can search dead-end pores,
which is of great significance in the study of multiphase flow in porous media.

<p class="mathjax">Using spherical mirrors in place of wide-angle cameras allows for
cost-effective monitoring of manufacturing processes in hazardous environment,
where a camera would normally not operate. This includes environments of high
heat, vacuum and strong electromagnetic fields. Moreover, it allows the
layering of multiple camera types (e.g., color image, near-infrared,
long-wavelength infrared, ultraviolet) into a single wide-angle output, whilst
accounting for the different camera placements and lenses used. Normally, the
different camera positions introduce a parallax shift between the images, but
with a spherical projection as produced by a spherical mirror, this parallax
shift is reduced, depending on mirror size and distance to the monitoring
target.
<br />This paper introduces a variation of the 'mirror ball projection', that
accounts for distortion produced by a perspective camera at the pole of the
projection. Finally, the efficacy of process monitoring via a mirror ball is
evaluated.

<p class="mathjax">Modern text-to-image generation models produce high-quality images that are
both photorealistic and faithful to the text prompts. However, this quality
comes at significant computational cost: nearly all of these models are
iterative and require running inference multiple times with large models. This
iterative process is needed to ensure that different regions of the image are
not only aligned with the text prompt, but also compatible with each other. In
this work, we propose a light-weight approach to achieving this compatibility
between different regions of an image, using a Markov Random Field (MRF) model.
This method is shown to work in conjunction with the recently proposed Muse
model. The MRF encodes the compatibility among image tokens at different
spatial locations and enables us to significantly reduce the required number of
Muse prediction steps. Inference with the MRF is significantly cheaper, and its
parameters can be quickly learned through back-propagation by modeling MRF
inference as a differentiable neural-network layer. Our full model, SPEGTI,
uses this proposed MRF model to speed up Muse by 1.5X with no loss in output
image quality.

<p class="mathjax">Our previous experiments demonstrated that subsets collections of (short)
documents (with several hundred entries) share a common normalized in some way
eigenvalue spectrum of combinatorial Laplacian. Based on this insight, we
propose a method of incremental spectral clustering. The method consists of the
following steps: (1) split the data into manageable subsets, (2) cluster each
of the subsets, (3) merge clusters from different subsets based on the
eigenvalue spectrum similarity to form clusters of the entire set. This method
can be especially useful for clustering methods of complexity strongly
increasing with the size of the data sample,like in case of typical spectral
clustering. Experiments were performed showing that in fact the clustering and
merging the subsets yields clusters close to clustering the entire dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The groundbreaking invention of ChatGPT has triggered enormous discussion
among users across all fields and domains. Among celebration around its various
advantages, questions have been raised with regards to its correctness and
ethics of its use. Efforts are already underway towards capturing user
sentiments around it. But it begs the question as to how the research community
is analyzing ChatGPT with regards to various aspects of its usage. It is this
sentiment of the researchers that we analyze in our work. Since Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis has usually only been applied on a few datasets, it gives
limited success and that too only on short text data. We propose a methodology
that uses Explainable AI to facilitate such analysis on research data. Our
technique presents valuable insights into extending the state of the art of
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on newer datasets, where such analysis is not
hampered by the length of the text data.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new way to assess certain short constructed responses to
mathematics items. Our approach uses a pipeline that identifies the key values
specified by the student in their response. This allows us to determine the
correctness of the response, as well as identify any misconceptions. The
information from the value identification pipeline can then be used to provide
feedback to the teacher and student. The value identification pipeline consists
of two fine-tuned language models. The first model determines if a value is
implicit in the student response. The second model identifies where in the
response the key value is specified. We consider both a generic model that can
be used for any prompt and value, as well as models that are specific to each
prompt and value. The value identification pipeline is a more accurate and
informative way to assess short constructed responses than traditional
rubric-based scoring. It can be used to provide more targeted feedback to
students, which can help them improve their understanding of mathematics.

<p class="mathjax">The action of a noise operator on a code transforms it into a distribution on
the respective space. Some common examples from information theory include
Bernoulli noise acting on a code in the Hamming space and Gaussian noise acting
on a lattice in the Euclidean space. We aim to characterize the cases when the
output distribution is close to the uniform distribution on the space, as
measured by R{\'e}nyi divergence of order $\alpha \in [1,\infty]$. A version of
this question is known as the channel resolvability problem in information
theory, and it has implications for security guarantees in wiretap channels,
error correction, discrepancy, worst-to-average case complexity reductions, and
many other problems.
<br />Our work quantifies the requirements for asymptotic uniformity (perfect
smoothing) and identifies explicit code families that achieve it under the
action of the Bernoulli and ball noise operators on the code. We derive
expressions for the minimum rate of codes required to attain asymptotically
perfect smoothing. In proving our results, we leverage recent results from
harmonic analysis of functions on the Hamming space. Another result pertains to
the use of code families in Wyner's transmission scheme on the binary wiretap
channel. We identify explicit families that guarantee strong secrecy when
applied in this scheme, showing that nested Reed-Muller codes can transmit
messages reliably and securely over a binary symmetric wiretap channel with a
positive rate. Finally, we establish a connection between smoothing and error
correction in the binary symmetric channel.

<p class="mathjax">Neuromorphic computing aims to mimic both the function and structure of
biological neural networks to provide artificial intelligence with extreme
efficiency. Conventional approaches store synaptic weights in non-volatile
memory devices with analog resistance states, permitting in-memory computation
of neural network operations while avoiding the costs associated with
transferring synaptic weights from a memory array. However, the use of analog
resistance states for storing weights in neuromorphic systems is impeded by
stochastic writing, weights drifting over time through stochastic processes,
and limited endurance that reduces the precision of synapse weights. Here we
propose and experimentally demonstrate neuromorphic networks that provide
high-accuracy inference thanks to the binary resistance states of magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs), while leveraging the analog nature of their stochastic
spin-transfer torque (STT) switching for unsupervised Hebbian learning. We
performed the first experimental demonstration of a neuromorphic network
directly implemented with MTJ synapses, for both inference and
spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning. We also demonstrated through
simulation that the proposed system for unsupervised Hebbian learning with
stochastic STT-MTJ synapses can achieve competitive accuracies for MNIST
handwritten digit recognition. By appropriately applying neuromorphic
principles through hardware-aware design, the proposed STT-MTJ neuromorphic
learning networks provide a pathway toward artificial intelligence hardware
that learns autonomously with extreme efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Clinical event sequences consist of hundreds of clinical events that
represent records of patient care in time. Developing accurate predictive
models of such sequences is of a great importance for supporting a variety of
models for interpreting/classifying the current patient condition, or
predicting adverse clinical events and outcomes, all aimed to improve patient
care. One important challenge of learning predictive models of clinical
sequences is their patient-specific variability. Based on underlying clinical
conditions, each patient's sequence may consist of different sets of clinical
events (observations, lab results, medications, procedures). Hence, simple
population-wide models learned from event sequences for many different patients
may not accurately predict patient-specific dynamics of event sequences and
their differences. To address the problem, we propose and investigate multiple
new event sequence prediction models and methods that let us better adjust the
prediction for individual patients and their specific conditions. The methods
developed in this work pursue refinement of population-wide models to
subpopulations, self-adaptation, and a meta-level model switching that is able
to adaptively select the model with the best chance to support the immediate
prediction. We analyze and test the performance of these models on clinical
event sequences of patients in MIMIC-III database.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel transformer-based framework that reconstructs two high
fidelity hands from multi-view RGB images. Unlike existing hand pose estimation
methods, where one typically trains a deep network to regress hand model
parameters from single RGB image, we consider a more challenging problem
setting where we directly regress the absolute root poses of two-hands with
extended forearm at high resolution from egocentric view. As existing datasets
are either infeasible for egocentric viewpoints or lack background variations,
we create a large-scale synthetic dataset with diverse scenarios and collect a
real dataset from multi-calibrated camera setup to verify our proposed
multi-view image feature fusion strategy. To make the reconstruction physically
plausible, we propose two strategies: (i) a coarse-to-fine spectral graph
convolution decoder to smoothen the meshes during upsampling and (ii) an
optimisation-based refinement stage at inference to prevent self-penetrations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our
framework is able to produce realistic two-hand reconstructions and demonstrate
the generalisation of synthetic-trained models to real data, as well as
real-time AR/VR applications.

<p class="mathjax">Since wearable linkage mechanisms could control the moment transmission from
actuator(s) to wearers, they can help ensure that even low-cost wearable
systems provide advanced functionality tailored to users' needs. For example,
if a hip mechanism transforms an input torque into a spatially-varying moment,
a wearer can get effective assistance both in the sagittal and frontal planes
during walking, even with an affordable single-actuator system. However, due to
the combinatorial nature of the linkage mechanism design space, the topologies
of such nonlinear-moment-generating mechanisms are challenging to determine,
even with significant computational resources and numerical data. Furthermore,
on-premise production development and interactive design are nearly impossible
in conventional synthesis approaches. Here, we propose an innovative autonomous
computational approach for synthesizing such wearable robot mechanisms,
eliminating the need for exhaustive searches or numerous data sets. Our method
transforms the synthesis problem into a gradient-based optimization problem
with sophisticated objective and constraint functions while ensuring the
desired degree of freedom, range of motion, and force transmission
characteristics. To generate arbitrary mechanism topologies and dimensions, we
employed a unified ground model. By applying the proposed method for the design
of hip joint mechanisms, the topologies and dimensions of non-series-type hip
joint mechanisms were obtained. Biomechanical simulations validated its
multi-moment assistance capability, and its wearability was verified via
prototype fabrication. The proposed design strategy can open a new way to
design various wearable robot mechanisms, such as shoulders, knees, and ankles.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents the design, implementation and validation of learning
techniques based on the kNN scheme for gesture detection in prosthetic control.
To cope with high computational demands in instance-based prediction, methods
of dataset reduction are evaluated considering real-time determinism to allow
for the reliable integration into battery-powered portable devices. The
influence of parameterization and varying proportionality schemes is analyzed,
utilizing an eight-channel-sEMG armband. Besides offline cross-validation
accuracy, success rates in real-time pilot experiments (online target
achievement tests) are determined. Based on the assessment of specific dataset
reduction techniques' adequacy for embedded control applications regarding
accuracy and timing behaviour, Decision Surface Mapping (DSM) proves itself
promising when applying kNN on the reduced set. A randomized, double-blind user
study was conducted to evaluate the respective methods (kNN and kNN with
DSM-reduction) against Ridge Regression (RR) and RR with Random Fourier
Features (RR-RFF). The kNN-based methods performed significantly better
(p&lt;0.0005) than the regression techniques. Between DSM-kNN and kNN, there was
no statistically significant difference (significance level 0.05). This is
remarkable in consideration of only one sample per class in the reduced set,
thus yielding a reduction rate of over 99% while preserving success rate. The
same behaviour could be confirmed in an extended user study. With k=1, which
turned out to be an excellent choice, the runtime complexity of both kNN (in
every prediction step) as well as DSM-kNN (in the training phase) becomes
linear concerning the number of original samples, favouring dependable wearable
prosthesis applications.

<p class="mathjax">This paper tackles the challenging task of evaluating socially situated
conversational robots and presents a novel objective evaluation approach that
relies on multimodal user behaviors. In this study, our main focus is on
assessing the human-likeness of the robot as the primary evaluation metric.
While previous research often relied on subjective evaluations from users, our
approach aims to evaluate the robot's human-likeness based on observable user
behaviors indirectly, thus enhancing objectivity and reproducibility. To begin,
we created an annotated dataset of human-likeness scores, utilizing user
behaviors found in an attentive listening dialogue corpus. We then conducted an
analysis to determine the correlation between multimodal user behaviors and
human-likeness scores, demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed
behavior-based evaluation method.

<p class="mathjax">There are many ways of interpreting the world and they are highly
interdependent. We exploit such complex dependencies and introduce a powerful
multi-task hypergraph, in which every node is a task and different paths
through the hypergraph reaching a given task become unsupervised teachers, by
forming ensembles that learn to generate reliable pseudolabels for that task.
Each hyperedge is part of an ensemble teacher for a given task and it is also a
student of the self-supervised hypergraph system. We apply our model to one of
the most important problems of our times, that of Earth Observation, which is
highly multi-task and it often suffers from missing ground-truth data. By
performing extensive experiments on the NASA NEO Dataset, spanning a period of
22 years, we demonstrate the value of our multi-task semi-supervised approach,
by consistent improvements over strong baselines and recent work. We also show
that the hypergraph can adapt unsupervised to gradual data distribution shifts
and reliably recover, through its multi-task self-supervision process, the
missing data for several observational layers for up to seven years.

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation Systems (RS) are often used to address the issue of medical
doctor referrals. However, these systems require access to patient feedback and
medical records, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios. Our
research focuses on medical referrals and aims to predict recommendations in
different specialties of physicians for both new patients and those with a
consultation history. We use Extreme Multilabel Classification (XML), commonly
employed in text-based classification tasks, to encode available features and
explore different scenarios. While its potential for recommendation tasks has
often been suggested, this has not been thoroughly explored in the literature.
Motivated by the doctor referral case, we show how to recast a traditional
recommender setting into a multilabel classification problem that current XML
methods can solve. Further, we propose a unified model leveraging patient
history across different specialties. Compared to state-of-the-art RS using the
same features, our approach consistently improves standard recommendation
metrics up to approximately $10\%$ for patients with a previous consultation
history. For new patients, XML proves better at exploiting available features,
outperforming the benchmark in favorable scenarios, with particular emphasis on
recall metrics. Thus, our approach brings us one step closer to creating more
effective and personalized doctor referral systems. Additionally, it highlights
XML as a promising alternative to current hybrid or content-based RS, while
identifying key aspects to take into account when using XML for recommendation
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, huge progress has been made on learning neural implicit
representations from multi-view images for 3D reconstruction. As an additional
input complementing coordinates, using sinusoidal functions as positional
encodings plays a key role in revealing high frequency details with
coordinate-based neural networks. However, high frequency positional encodings
make the optimization unstable, which results in noisy reconstructions and
artifacts in empty space. To resolve this issue in a general sense, we
introduce to learn neural implicit representations with quantized coordinates,
which reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity in the field during optimization.
Instead of continuous coordinates, we discretize continuous coordinates into
discrete coordinates using nearest interpolation among quantized coordinates
which are obtained by discretizing the field in an extremely high resolution.
We use discrete coordinates and their positional encodings to learn implicit
functions through volume rendering. This significantly reduces the variations
in the sample space, and triggers more multi-view consistency constraints on
intersections of rays from different views, which enables to infer implicit
function in a more effective way. Our quantized coordinates do not bring any
computational burden, and can seamlessly work upon the latest methods. Our
evaluations under the widely used benchmarks show our superiority over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning continues to rapidly evolve and is now demonstrating remarkable
potential for numerous medical prediction tasks. However, realizing deep
learning models that generalize across healthcare organizations is challenging.
This is due, in part, to the inherent siloed nature of these organizations and
patient privacy requirements. To address this problem, we illustrate how split
learning can enable collaborative training of deep learning models across
disparate and privately maintained health datasets, while keeping the original
records and model parameters private. We introduce a new privacy-preserving
distributed learning framework that offers a higher level of privacy compared
to conventional federated learning. We use several biomedical imaging and
electronic health record (EHR) datasets to show that deep learning models
trained via split learning can achieve highly similar performance to their
centralized and federated counterparts while greatly improving computational
efficiency and reducing privacy risks.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has received increasing attention
from researchers due to its wide range of applications. As conversation has a
natural graph structure, numerous approaches used to model ERC based on graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) have yielded significant results. However, the
aggregation approach of traditional GCNs suffers from the node information
redundancy problem, leading to node discriminant information loss.
Additionally, single-layer GCNs lack the capacity to capture long-range
contextual information from the graph. Furthermore, the majority of approaches
are based on textual modality or stitching together different modalities,
resulting in a weak ability to capture interactions between modalities. To
address these problems, we present the relational bilevel aggregation graph
convolutional network (RBA-GCN), which consists of three modules: the graph
generation module (GGM), similarity-based cluster building module (SCBM) and
bilevel aggregation module (BiAM). First, GGM constructs a novel graph to
reduce the redundancy of target node information. Then, SCBM calculates the
node similarity in the target node and its structural neighborhood, where noisy
information with low similarity is filtered out to preserve the discriminant
information of the node. Meanwhile, BiAM is a novel aggregation method that can
preserve the information of nodes during the aggregation process. This module
can construct the interaction between different modalities and capture
long-range contextual information based on similarity clusters. On both the
IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, the weighted average F1 score of RBA-GCN has a
2.17$\sim$5.21\% improvement over that of the most advanced method.

<p class="mathjax">We present Ramulator 2.0, a highly modular and extensible DRAM simulator that
enables rapid and agile implementation and evaluation of design changes in the
memory controller and DRAM to meet the increasing research effort in improving
the performance, security, and reliability of memory systems. Ramulator 2.0
abstracts and models key components in a DRAM-based memory system and their
interactions into shared interfaces and independent implementations. Doing so
enables easy modification and extension of the modeled functions of the memory
controller and DRAM in Ramulator 2.0. The DRAM specification syntax of
Ramulator 2.0 is concise and human-readable, facilitating easy modifications
and extensions. Ramulator 2.0 implements a library of reusable templated lambda
functions to model the functionalities of DRAM commands to simplify the
implementation of new DRAM standards, including DDR5, LPDDR5, HBM3, and GDDR6.
We showcase Ramulator 2.0's modularity and extensibility by implementing and
evaluating a wide variety of RowHammer mitigation techniques that require
different memory controller design changes. These techniques are added
modularly as separate implementations without changing any code in the baseline
memory controller implementation. Ramulator 2.0 is rigorously validated and
maintains a fast simulation speed compared to existing cycle-accurate DRAM
simulators. Ramulator 2.0 is open-sourced under the permissive MIT license at

<p class="mathjax">The need for reliable and low-cost infrastructure is crucial in today's
world. However, achieving both at the same time is often challenging.
Traditionally, infrastructure networks are designed with a radial topology
lacking redundancy, which makes them vulnerable to disruptions. As a result,
network topologies have evolved towards a ring topology with only one redundant
edge and, from there, to more complex mesh networks. However, we prove that
large rings are unreliable. Our research shows that a sparse mesh network with
a small number of redundant edges that follow some design rules can
significantly improve reliability while remaining cost-effective. Moreover, we
have identified key areas where adding redundant edges can impact network
reliability the most by using the SAIDI index, which measures the expected
number of consumers disconnected from the source node. These findings offer
network planners a valuable tool for quickly identifying and addressing
reliability issues without the need for complex simulations. Properly planned
sparse mesh networks can thus provide a reliable and a cost-effective solution
to modern infrastructure challenges.

on these networks. We present a case study on disaster resilience of social
networks given an epidemic outbreak by investigating the infection occurrence
within specific time and social distance. The experimental results show how
different levels of the structural and dynamics complexities, concerned with
feature diversity and flexibility of interaction rules respectively, influence
network growth and epidemic spread. The analysis revealed that, to achieve
maximum disaster resilience, mitigation policies should be targeted at nodes
with preferred features as they have higher infection risks and should be the
focus of the epidemic control.

social structure modeling, or different attacker profiles in a cybersecurity
setting. With the capacity of other agents being unknown at the beginning of
the game, the longstanding problems of imperfect information arise. Our
contribution is the following: (i) we define a new class of concurrent game
structures where the agents have different capacities that modify their action
list and (ii) we introduce a logic extending Alternating-time Temporal Logic to
reason about these games.

<p class="mathjax">System-on-Chips (SoCs) form the crux of modern computing systems. SoCs enable
high-level integration through the utilization of multiple Intellectual
Property (IP) cores. However, the integration of multiple IP cores also
presents unique challenges owing to their inherent vulnerabilities, thereby
compromising the security of the entire system. Hence, it is imperative to
perform hardware security validation to address these concerns. The efficiency
of this validation procedure is contingent on the quality of the SoC security
properties provided. However, generating security properties with traditional
approaches often requires expert intervention and is limited to a few IPs,
thereby resulting in a time-consuming and non-robust process. To address this
issue, we, for the first time, propose a novel and automated Natural Language
Processing (NLP)-based Security Property Generator (NSPG). Specifically, our
approach utilizes hardware documentation in order to propose the first hardware
security-specific language model, HS-BERT, for extracting security properties
dedicated to hardware design. To evaluate our proposed technique, we trained
the HS-BERT model using sentences from RISC-V, OpenRISC, MIPS, OpenSPARC, and
OpenTitan SoC documentation. When assessedb on five untrained OpenTitan
hardware IP documents, NSPG was able to extract 326 security properties from
1723 sentences. This, in turn, aided in identifying eight security bugs in the
OpenTitan SoC design presented in the hardware hacking competition, Hack@DAC
2022.

<p class="mathjax">Spurious correlations occur when a model learns unreliable features from the
data and are a well-known drawback of data-driven learning. Although there are
several algorithms proposed to mitigate it, we are yet to jointly derive the
indicators of spurious correlations. As a result, the solutions built upon
standalone hypotheses fail to beat simple ERM baselines. We collect some of the
commonly studied hypotheses behind the occurrence of spurious correlations and
investigate their influence on standard ERM baselines using synthetic datasets
generated from causal graphs. Subsequently, we observe patterns connecting
these hypotheses and model design choices.

<p class="mathjax">High-level synthesis (HLS) refers to the automatic translation of a software
program written in a high-level language into a hardware design. Modern HLS
tools have moved away from the traditional approach of static (compile time)
scheduling of operations to generating dynamic circuits that schedule
operations at run time. Such circuits trade-off area utilisation for increased
dynamism and throughput. However, existing lowering flows in dynamically
scheduled HLS tools rely on conservative assumptions on their input program due
to both the intermediate representations (IR) utilised as well as the lack of
formal specifications on the translation into hardware. These assumptions cause
suboptimal hardware performance. In this work, we lift these assumptions by
proposing a new and efficient abstraction for hardware mapping; namely h-GSA,
an extension of the Gated Single Static Assignment (GSA) IR. Using this
abstraction, we propose a lowering flow that transforms GSA into h-GSA and maps
h-GSA into dynamically scheduled hardware circuits. We compare the schedules
generated by our approach to those by the state-of-the-art dynamic-scheduling
HLS tool, Dynamatic, and illustrate the potential performance improvement from
hardware mapping using the proposed abstraction.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, several Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WS3)
methods have been proposed that use class activation maps (CAMs) generated by a
classifier to produce pseudo-ground truths for training segmentation models.
While CAMs are good at highlighting discriminative regions (DR) of an image,
they are known to disregard regions of the object that do not contribute to the
classifier's prediction, termed non-discriminative regions (NDR). In contrast,
attribution methods such as saliency maps provide an alternative approach for
assigning a score to every pixel based on its contribution to the
classification prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison
between saliencies and CAMs for WS3. Our study includes multiple perspectives
on understanding their similarities and dissimilarities. Moreover, we provide
new evaluation metrics that perform a comprehensive assessment of WS3
performance of alternative methods w.r.t. CAMs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of saliencies in addressing the limitation of CAMs through our
empirical studies on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose random
cropping as a stochastic aggregation technique that improves the performance of
saliency, making it a strong alternative to CAM for WS3.

<p class="mathjax">Analysis of a network in terms of vulnerability is one of the most
significant problems. Graph theory serves as a valuable tool for solving
complex network problems, and there exist numerous graph-theoretic parameters
to analyze the system's stability. Among these parameters, the closeness
parameter stands out as one of the most commonly used vulnerability metric. Its
definition has evolved over time to enhance ease of formulation and
applicability to disconnected structures. Furthermore, based on the closeness
parameter, residual closeness, which is a newer and more sensitive parameter
compared to other existing parameters, has been introduced as a new graph
vulnerability index by Dangalchev. In this study, the outcomes of the closeness
and residual closeness parameters in Harary Graphs have been examined. Harary
Graphs are well-known constructs that are distinguished by having $n$ vertices
that are $k$-connected with the least possible number of edges.

<p class="mathjax">While large-scale image-text pretrained models such as CLIP have been used
for multiple video-level tasks on trimmed videos, their use for temporal
localization in untrimmed videos is still a relatively unexplored task. We
design a new approach for this called UnLoc, which uses pretrained image and
text towers, and feeds tokens to a video-text fusion model. The output of the
fusion module are then used to construct a feature pyramid in which each level
connects to a head to predict a per-frame relevancy score and start/end time
displacements. Unlike previous works, our architecture enables Moment
Retrieval, Temporal Localization, and Action Segmentation with a single stage
model, without the need for action proposals, motion based pretrained features
or representation masking. Unlike specialized models, we achieve state of the
art results on all three different localization tasks with a unified approach.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider a real-world scenario where a model that is
trained on pre-defined classes continually encounters unlabeled data that
contains both known and novel classes. The goal is to continually discover
novel classes while maintaining the performance in known classes. We name the
setting Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD). Existing methods for
novel class discovery cannot directly handle the C-GCD setting due to some
unrealistic assumptions, such as the unlabeled data only containing novel
classes. Furthermore, they fail to discover novel classes in a continual
fashion. In this work, we lift all these assumptions and propose an approach,
called MetaGCD, to learn how to incrementally discover with less forgetting.
Our proposed method uses a meta-learning framework and leverages the offline
labeled data to simulate the testing incremental learning process. A
meta-objective is defined to revolve around two conflicting learning objectives
to achieve novel class discovery without forgetting. Furthermore, a soft
neighborhood-based contrastive network is proposed to discriminate uncorrelated
images while attracting correlated images. We build strong baselines and
conduct extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks to demonstrate
the superiority of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Automation of High-Level Context (HLC) reasoning for intelligent systems at
scale is imperative due to the unceasing accumulation of contextual data in the
IoT era, the trend of the fusion of data from multi-sources, and the intrinsic
complexity and dynamism of the context-based decision-making process. To
mitigate this issue, we propose an automatic context reasoning framework
CSM-H-R, which programmatically combines ontologies and states at runtime and
the model-storage phase for attaining the ability to recognize meaningful HLC,
and the resulting data representation can be applied to different reasoning
techniques. Case studies are developed based on an intelligent elevator system
in a smart campus setting. An implementation of the framework - a CSM Engine,
and the experiments of translating the HLC reasoning into vector and matrix
computing especially take care of the dynamic aspects of context and present
the potentiality of using advanced mathematical and probabilistic models to
achieve the next level of automation in integrating intelligent systems;
meanwhile, privacy protection support is achieved by anonymization through
label embedding and reducing information correlation. The code of this study is

<p class="mathjax">Recently emerged Topological Deep Learning (TDL) methods aim to extend
current Graph Neural Networks (GNN) by naturally processing higher-order
interactions, going beyond the pairwise relations and local neighborhoods
defined by graph representations. In this paper we propose a novel TDL-based
method for compressing signals over graphs, consisting in two main steps:
first, disjoint sets of higher-order structures are inferred based on the
original signal --by clustering $N$ datapoints into $K\ll N$ collections; then,
a topological-inspired message passing gets a compressed representation of the
signal within those multi-element sets. Our results show that our framework
improves both standard GNN and feed-forward architectures in compressing
temporal link-based signals from two real-word Internet Service Provider
Networks' datasets --from $30\%$ up to $90\%$ better reconstruction errors
across all evaluation scenarios--, suggesting that it better captures and
exploits spatial and temporal correlations over the whole graph-based network
structure.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various
applications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks (Trojans). The backdoor-compromised model will mis-classify to
the target class chosen by the attacker when a test instance (from a non-target
class) is embedded with a specific trigger, while maintaining high accuracy on
attack-free instances. Although there are extensive studies on backdoor attacks
against image data, the susceptibility of video-based systems under backdoor
attacks remains largely unexplored. Current studies are direct extensions of
approaches proposed for image data, e.g., the triggers are
\textbf{independently} embedded within the frames, which tend to be detectable
by existing defenses. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{simple} yet
\textit{effective} backdoor attack against video data. Our proposed attack,
adding perturbations in a transformed domain, plants an \textbf{imperceptible,
temporally distributed} trigger across the video frames, and is shown to be
resilient to existing defensive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed
attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models
on two video recognition benchmarks, UCF101 and HMDB51, and a sign language
recognition benchmark, Greek Sign Language (GSL) dataset. We delve into the
impact of several influential factors on our proposed attack and identify an
intriguing effect termed "collateral damage" through extensive studies.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-agent interactions, such as communication, teaching, and bluffing,
often rely on higher-order social inference, i.e., understanding how others
infer oneself. Such intricate reasoning can be effectively modeled through
nested multi-agent reasoning. Nonetheless, the computational complexity
escalates exponentially with each level of reasoning, posing a significant
challenge. However, humans effortlessly perform complex social inferences as
part of their daily lives. To bridge the gap between human-like inference
capabilities and computational limitations, we propose a novel approach:
leveraging neural networks to amortize high-order social inference, thereby
expediting nested multi-agent reasoning. We evaluate our method in two
challenging multi-agent interaction domains. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient while exhibiting
minimal degradation in accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Video anomaly detection (VAD) without human monitoring is a complex computer
vision task that can have a positive impact on society if implemented
successfully. While recent advances have made significant progress in solving
this task, most existing approaches overlook a critical real-world concern:
privacy. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence
technologies, it becomes crucial to implement proper AI ethics into their
development. Privacy leakage in VAD allows models to pick up and amplify
unnecessary biases related to people's personal information, which may lead to
undesirable decision making. In this paper, we propose TeD-SPAD, a
privacy-aware video anomaly detection framework that destroys visual private
information in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we propose the use of a
temporally-distinct triplet loss to promote temporally discriminative features,
which complements current weakly-supervised VAD methods. Using TeD-SPAD, we
achieve a positive trade-off between privacy protection and utility anomaly
detection performance on three popular weakly supervised VAD datasets:
UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed anonymization model
reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only reducing frame-level
ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset by 3.69%. Project Page:

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce audio-visual class-incremental learning, a
class-incremental learning scenario for audio-visual video recognition. We
demonstrate that joint audio-visual modeling can improve class-incremental
learning, but current methods fail to preserve semantic similarity between
audio and visual features as incremental step grows. Furthermore, we observe
that audio-visual correlations learned in previous tasks can be forgotten as
incremental steps progress, leading to poor performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose AV-CIL, which incorporates Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity
Constraint (D-AVSC) to maintain both instance-aware and class-aware semantic
similarity between audio-visual modalities and Visual Attention Distillation
(VAD) to retain previously learned audio-guided visual attentive ability. We
create three audio-visual class-incremental datasets, AVE-Class-Incremental
(AVE-CI), Kinetics-Sounds-Class-Incremental (K-S-CI), and
VGGSound100-Class-Incremental (VS100-CI) based on the AVE, Kinetics-Sounds, and
VGGSound datasets, respectively. Our experiments on AVE-CI, K-S-CI, and
VS100-CI demonstrate that AV-CIL significantly outperforms existing
class-incremental learning methods in audio-visual class-incremental learning.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the low rank matrix completion problem over finite fields. This
problem has been extensively studied in the domain of real/complex numbers,
however, to the best of authors' knowledge, there exists merely one efficient
algorithm to tackle the problem in the binary field, due to Saunderson et al.
[1]. In this paper, we improve upon the theoretical guarantees for the
algorithm provided in [1]. Furthermore, we formulate a new graphical model for
the matrix completion problem over the finite field of size $q$, $\Bbb{F}_q$,
and present a message passing (MP) based approach to solve this problem. The
proposed algorithm is the first one for the considered matrix completion
problem over finite fields of arbitrary size. Our proposed method has a
significantly lower computational complexity, reducing it from $O(n^{2r+3})$ in
[1] down to $O(n^2)$ (where, the underlying matrix has dimension $n \times n$
and $r$ denotes its rank), while also improving the performance.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting high dimensional video sequences is a curiously difficult problem.
The number of possible futures for a given video sequence grows exponentially
over time due to uncertainty. This is especially evident when trying to predict
complicated natural video scenes from a limited snapshot of the world. The
inherent uncertainty accumulates the further into the future you predict making
long-term prediction very difficult. In this work we introduce a number of
improvements to existing work that aid in creating Robust Video Predictors
(RoViPs). We show that with a combination of deep Perceptual and
uncertainty-based reconstruction losses we are able to create high quality
short-term predictions. Attention-based skip connections are utilised to allow
for long range spatial movement of input features to further improve
performance. Finally, we show that by simply making the predictor robust to its
own prediction errors, it is possible to produce very long, realistic natural
video sequences using an iterated single-step prediction task.

<p class="mathjax">Smart contract vulnerabilities and bugs have become a key concern for
software engineers, as they can lead to significant financial losses,
reputational damage, and legal issues. Therefore, prioritizing bug fixing for
smart contracts is critical to maintaining trust. Due to the lack of tracking
tools, prioritizing smart contract-reported bugs is done manually, which is a
tedious task, limits bug triaging, and needs specialized knowledge. Towards
this end, we propose PrAIoritize; an automated approach for predicting smart
contract bug priorities that assist software engineers in prioritizing highly
urgent bug reports. PrAIoritize consists of two main phases: 1) automatic
labeling, which involves the automatic construction of a smart contract keyword
lexicon and the automatic assignment of priority levels to unlabeled bug
reports; 2) model construction, which involves feature engineering and designs
layers of feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) and bidirectional long
short-term memory (BiLSTM) with multi-class classification to better capture
the features of the textual descriptions of bugs and predict their priority
levels. The model then is trained using smart contract bug reports collected
from two data sources: open-source software (OSS) projects available on GitHub
and NVD vulnerability database. Our evaluation demonstrates significant
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines and commonly used pre-trained
models (e.g. BERT) for similar classification tasks, with 5.75%-35.29% increase
in F-measure, precision, and recall.

<p class="mathjax">Voice conversion as the style transfer task applied to speech, refers to
converting one person's speech into a new speech that sounds like another
person's. Up to now, there has been a lot of research devoted to better
implementation of VC tasks. However, a good voice conversion model should not
only match the timbre information of the target speaker, but also expressive
information such as prosody, pace, pause, etc. In this context, prosody
modeling is crucial for achieving expressive voice conversion that sounds
natural and convincing. Unfortunately, prosody modeling is important but
challenging, especially without text transcriptions. In this paper, we firstly
propose a novel voice conversion framework named 'PMVC', which effectively
separates and models the content, timbre, and prosodic information from the
speech without text transcriptions. Specially, we introduce a new speech
augmentation algorithm for robust prosody extraction. And building upon this,
mask and predict mechanism is applied in the disentanglement of prosody and
content information. The experimental results on the AIShell-3 corpus supports
our improvement of naturalness and similarity of converted speech.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a methodology that uses an optical tactile sensor
for efficient tactile exploration of embedded objects within soft materials.
The methodology consists of an exploration phase, where a probabilistic
estimate of the location of the embedded objects is built using a Bayesian
approach. The exploration phase is then followed by a mapping phase which
exploits the probabilistic map to reconstruct the underlying topography of the
workspace by sampling in more detail regions where there is expected to be
embedded objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we tested our
approach on an experimental setup that consists of a series of quartz beads
located underneath a polyethylene foam that prevents direct observation of the
configuration and requires the use of tactile exploration to recover the
location of the beads. We show the performance of our methodology using ten
different configurations of the beads where the proposed approach is able to
approximate the underlying configuration. We benchmark our results against a
random sampling policy.

area is the key to successful disaster response. Unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), workers and cars can collaborate to accomplish sensing tasks, such as
data collection, in disaster-stricken areas. In this paper, we explicitly
address the route planning for a group of agents, including UAVs, workers, and
cars, with the goal of maximizing the task completion rate. We propose
MANF-RL-RP, a heterogeneous multi-agent route planning algorithm that
incorporates several efficient designs, including global-local dual information
processing and a tailored model structure for heterogeneous multi-agent
systems. Global-local dual information processing encompasses the extraction
and dissemination of spatial features from global information, as well as the
partitioning and filtering of local information from individual agents.
Regarding the construction of the model structure for heterogeneous
multi-agent, we perform the following work. We design the same data structure
to represent the states of different agents, prove the Markovian property of
the decision-making process of agents to simplify the model structure, and also
design a reasonable reward function to train the model. Finally, we conducted
detailed experiments based on the rich simulation data. In comparison to the
baseline algorithms, namely Greedy-SC-RP and MANF-DNN-RP, MANF-RL-RP has
exhibited a significant improvement in terms of task completion rate.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithmic Fairness and the explainability of potentially unfair outcomes
are crucial for establishing trust and accountability of Artificial
Intelligence systems in domains such as healthcare and policing. Though
significant advances have been made in each of the fields separately, achieving
explainability in fairness applications remains challenging, particularly so in
domains where deep neural networks are used. At the same time, ethical
data-mining has become ever more relevant, as it has been shown countless times
that fairness-unaware algorithms result in biased outcomes. Current approaches
focus on mitigating biases in the outcomes of the model, but few attempts have
been made to try to explain \emph{why} a model is biased. To bridge this gap,
we propose a comprehensive approach that leverages optimal transport theory to
uncover the causes and implications of biased regions in images, which easily
extends to tabular data as well. Through the use of Wasserstein barycenters, we
obtain scores that are independent of a sensitive variable but keep their
marginal orderings. This step ensures predictive accuracy but also helps us to
recover the regions most associated with the generation of the biases. Our
findings hold significant implications for the development of trustworthy and
unbiased AI systems, fostering transparency, accountability, and fairness in
critical decision-making scenarios across diverse domains.

<p class="mathjax">We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pre-trained
open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open
visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for
many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text
datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks.
For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained
models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where
task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models
by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to
video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object
representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one
frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on
video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to
tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of
the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW
benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from
large-scale image-text pre-training, can be transferred successfully to
open-world localization across diverse videos.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a critical role in wireless
communications by autonomously classifying signals transmitted over the radio
spectrum. Deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly being used for AMC due
to their ability to extract complex wireless signal features. However, DL
models are computationally intensive and incur high inference latencies. This
paper proposes the application of early exiting (EE) techniques for DL models
used for AMC to accelerate inference. We present and analyze four early exiting
architectures and a customized multi-branch training algorithm for this
problem. Through extensive experimentation, we show that signals with moderate
to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are easier to classify, do not require
deep architectures, and can therefore leverage the proposed EE architectures.
Our experimental results demonstrate that EE techniques can significantly
reduce the inference speed of deep neural networks without sacrificing
classification accuracy. We also thoroughly study the trade-off between
classification accuracy and inference time when using these architectures. To
the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to apply
early exiting methods to AMC, providing a foundation for future research in
this area.

aspect of privacy protection in the European Union and Switzerland. With the
advent of LLMs, concerns about large-scale re-identification of anonymized
persons are growing. In accordance with the Federal Supreme Court of
Switzerland, we explore the potential of LLMs to re-identify individuals in
court rulings by constructing a proof-of-concept using actual legal data from
the Swiss federal supreme court. Following the initial experiment, we
constructed an anonymized Wikipedia dataset as a more rigorous testing ground
to further investigate the findings. With the introduction and application of
the new task of re-identifying people in texts, we also introduce new metrics
to measure performance. We systematically analyze the factors that influence
successful re-identifications, identifying model size, input length, and
instruction tuning among the most critical determinants. Despite high
re-identification rates on Wikipedia, even the best LLMs struggled with court
decisions. The complexity is attributed to the lack of test datasets, the
necessity for substantial training resources, and data sparsity in the
information used for re-identification. In conclusion, this study demonstrates
that re-identification using LLMs may not be feasible for now, but as the
proof-of-concept on Wikipedia showed, it might become possible in the future.
We hope that our system can help enhance the confidence in the security of
anonymized decisions, thus leading to the courts being more confident to
publish decisions.

<p class="mathjax">A novel algorithm to detect road lanes in videos, called recursive video lane
detector (RVLD), is proposed in this paper, which propagates the state of a
current frame recursively to the next frame. RVLD consists of an intra-frame
lane detector (ILD) and a predictive lane detector (PLD). First, we design ILD
to localize lanes in a still frame. Second, we develop PLD to exploit the
information of the previous frame for lane detection in a current frame. To
this end, we estimate a motion field and warp the previous output to the
current frame. Using the warped information, we refine the feature map of the
current frame to detect lanes more reliably. Experimental results show that
RVLD outperforms existing detectors on video lane datasets. Our codes are
available at https://github.com/dongkwonjin/RVLD.

<p class="mathjax">In Asian countries, there is a tradition that a rabbit (the Moon rabbit)
lives on the Moon. As the origin of this tradition, usually, two reasons are
mentioned. One reason is that the color pattern of the lunar surface is similar
to the shape of a rabbit. The other reason is that both the Moon and rabbit are
symbols of fertility because the Moon appears and disappears (i.e., waxing and
waning) cyclically, and rabbits bear children frequently. Considering the
latter reason, is the lunar surface color pattern not similar to a rabbit?
Here, the similarity between rabbit and the lunar surface pattern was evaluated
using seven AI architectures. In the test by CLIP, assuming that people look at
the Moon in the early evening frequently, the lunar surface is more similar to
a rabbit than a face at low latitude regions, while it can be classified as
face as latitude increases, which is consistent with that the oldest literature
about the Moon rabbit was written in India and that there is a culture of
human's face in the Moon in Europe. Tested with ImageNet weights, ConvNeXt and
CLIP sometimes classified the lunar surface pattern into rabbit with relatively
high probabilities. Cultures are generated by our attitude to the environment.
Both dynamic and static similarities may be required to induce our imagination.

novel formal analysis for the fine-grained verification of utility in complex
privacy pipelines. The combination explains a surprising anomaly in the
behaviour of utility of privacy-preserving pipelines -- that sometimes a
reduction in privacy results also in a decrease in utility. We use the standard
measure of utility for Bayesian analysis, introduced by Ghosh at al., to
produce tractable and rigorous proofs of the fine-grained statistical behaviour
leading to the anomaly. More generally, we offer the prospect of
formal-analysis tools for utility that complement extant formal analyses of

<p class="mathjax">The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) framework entertains the
possibility of evaluating a trained machine learning model without resorting to
a labeled testing set. Despite the promise and some decent results, the
existing AutoEval methods heavily rely on computing distribution shifts between
the unlabelled testing set and the training set. We believe this reliance on
the training set becomes another obstacle in shipping this technology to
real-world ML development. In this work, we propose Contrastive Automatic Model
Evaluation (CAME), a novel AutoEval framework that is rid of involving training
set in the loop. The core idea of CAME bases on a theoretical analysis which
bonds the model performance with a contrastive loss. Further, with extensive
empirical validation, we manage to set up a predictable relationship between
the two, simply by deducing on the unlabeled/unseen testing set. The resulting
framework CAME establishes a new SOTA results for AutoEval by surpassing prior
work significantly.

<p class="mathjax">As demands for high-quality videos continue to rise, high-resolution and
high-dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques are drawing attention. To generate
an HDR video from low dynamic range (LDR) images, one of the critical steps is
the motion compensation between LDR frames, for which most existing works
employed the optical flow algorithm. However, these methods suffer from flow
estimation errors when saturation or complicated motions exist. In this paper,
we propose an end-to-end HDR video composition framework, which aligns LDR
frames in the feature space and then merges aligned features into an HDR frame,
without relying on pixel-domain optical flow. Specifically, we propose a
luminance-based alignment network for HDR (LAN-HDR) consisting of an alignment
module and a hallucination module. The alignment module aligns a frame to the
adjacent reference by evaluating luminance-based attention, excluding color
information. The hallucination module generates sharp details, especially for
washed-out areas due to saturation. The aligned and hallucinated features are
then blended adaptively to complement each other. Finally, we merge the
features to generate a final HDR frame. In training, we adopt a temporal loss,
in addition to frame reconstruction losses, to enhance temporal consistency and
thus reduce flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
performs better or comparable to state-of-the-art methods on several
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Sub-new stock price prediction, forecasting the price trends of stocks listed
less than one year, is crucial for effective quantitative trading. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated effectiveness in predicting old stock
prices, they require large training datasets unavailable for sub-new stocks. In
this paper, we propose Meta-Stock: a task-difficulty-adaptive meta-learning
approach for sub-new stock price prediction. Leveraging prediction tasks
formulated by old stocks, our meta-learning method aims to acquire the fast
generalization ability that can be further adapted to sub-new stock price
prediction tasks, thereby solving the data scarcity of sub-new stocks.
Moreover, we enhance the meta-learning process by incorporating an adaptive
learning strategy sensitive to varying task difficulties. Through wavelet
transform, we extract high-frequency coefficients to manifest stock price
volatility. This allows the meta-learning model to assign gradient weights
based on volatility-quantified task difficulty. Extensive experiments on
datasets collected from three stock markets spanning twenty-two years prove
that our Meta-Stock significantly outperforms previous methods and manifests
strong applicability in real-world stock trading. Besides, we evaluate the
reasonability of the task difficulty quantification and the effectiveness of
the adaptive learning strategy.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel method that leverages a visual-language model,
CLIP, as a data source for zero-shot anomaly detection. Tremendous efforts have
been put towards developing anomaly detectors due to their potential industrial
applications. Considering the difficulty in acquiring various anomalous samples
for training, most existing methods train models with only normal samples and
measure discrepancies from the distribution of normal samples during inference,
which requires training a model for each object category. The problem of this
inefficient training requirement has been tackled by designing a CLIP-based
anomaly detector that applies prompt-guided classification to each part of an
image in a sliding window manner. However, the method still suffers from the
labor of careful prompt ensembling with known object categories. To overcome
the issues above, we propose leveraging CLIP as a data source for training. Our
method generates text embeddings with the text encoder in CLIP with typical
prompts that include words of normal and anomaly. In addition to these words,
we insert several randomly generated words into prompts, which enables the
encoder to generate a diverse set of normal and anomalous samples. Using the
generated embeddings as training data, a feed-forward neural network learns to
extract features of normal and anomaly from CLIP's embeddings, and as a result,
a category-agnostic anomaly detector can be obtained without any training
images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance without laborious prompt ensembling in zero-shot
setups.

<p class="mathjax">Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are algorithms that fuse inertial
measurements of angular velocity and specific acceleration with supplementary
sensors including GNSS and magnetometers to estimate the position, velocity and
attitude, or extended pose, of a vehicle. The industry-standard extended Kalman
filter (EKF) does not come with strong stability or robustness guarantees and
can be subject to catastrophic failure. This paper exploits a Lie group
symmetry of the INS dynamics to propose the first nonlinear observer for INS
with error dynamics that are almost-globally asymptotically and locally
exponentially stable, independently of the chosen gains. The observer is aided
only by a GNSS measurement of position. As expected, the convergence guarantee
depends on persistence of excitation of the vehicle's specific acceleration in
the inertial frame. Simulation results demonstrate the observer's performance
and its ability to converge from extreme errors in the initial state estimates.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance on
various graph learning tasks, including recommendation, where they leverage
user-item collaborative filtering signals in graphs. However, theoretical
formulations of their capability are scarce, despite their empirical
effectiveness in state-of-the-art recommender models. Recently, research has
explored the expressiveness of GNNs in general, demonstrating that message
passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, and that
GNNs combined with random node initialization are universal. Nevertheless, the
concept of "expressiveness" for GNNs remains vaguely defined. Most existing
works adopt the graph isomorphism test as the metric of expressiveness, but
this graph-level task may not effectively assess a model's ability in
recommendation, where the objective is to distinguish nodes of different
closeness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of
the expressiveness of GNNs in recommendation, considering three levels of
expressiveness metrics: graph isomorphism (graph-level), node automorphism
(node-level), and topological closeness (link-level). We propose the
topological closeness metric to evaluate GNNs' ability to capture the
structural distance between nodes, which aligns closely with the objective of
recommendation. To validate the effectiveness of this new metric in evaluating
recommendation performance, we introduce a learning-less GNN algorithm that is
optimal on the new metric and can be optimal on the node-level metric with
suitable modification. We conduct extensive experiments comparing the proposed
algorithm against various types of state-of-the-art GNN models to explore the
explainability of the new metric in the recommendation task. For
reproducibility, implementation codes are available at

attention scores. Yet, current proposals rarely address methods capturing
longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, as they appear
in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. In
this paper, we propose a hierarchy-distance structural encoding (HDSE), which
models a hierarchical distance between the nodes in a graph focusing on its
multi-level, hierarchical nature. In particular, this yields a framework which
can be flexibly integrated with existing graph transformers, allowing for
simultaneous application with other positional representations. Through
extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our HDSE
method successfully enhances various types of baseline transformers, achieving
state-of-the-art empirical performances on 10 benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated significant
advances in high-quality view synthesis. A major limitation of NeRF is its low
rendering efficiency due to the need for multiple network forwardings to render
a single pixel. Existing methods to improve NeRF either reduce the number of
required samples or optimize the implementation to accelerate the network
forwarding. Despite these efforts, the problem of multiple sampling persists
due to the intrinsic representation of radiance fields. In contrast, Neural
Light Fields (NeLF) reduce the computation cost of NeRF by querying only one
single network forwarding per pixel. To achieve a close visual quality to NeRF,
existing NeLF methods require significantly larger network capacities which
limits their rendering efficiency in practice. In this work, we propose a new
representation called Neural Radiance Distribution Field (NeRDF) that targets
efficient view synthesis in real-time. Specifically, we use a small network
similar to NeRF while preserving the rendering speed with a single network
forwarding per pixel as in NeLF. The key is to model the radiance distribution
along each ray with frequency basis and predict frequency weights using the
network. Pixel values are then computed via volume rendering on radiance
distributions. Experiments show that our proposed method offers a better
trade-off among speed, quality, and network size than existing methods: we
achieve a ~254x speed-up over NeRF with similar network size, with only a
marginal performance decline. Our project page is at
yushuang-wu.github.io/NeRDF.

<p class="mathjax">With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in
natural language processing (NLP) domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems
have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this
paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for
zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify
and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs
in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a
textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context
is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue
and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel
framework, namely Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for
recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot
recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve
the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for
LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for
few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction
tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training
samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both
the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct
extensive experiments on a real-world public dataset (i.e., MovieLens-1M) to
demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as
well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension.

<p class="mathjax">Interactive Recommender Systems (IRSs) have attracted a lot of attention, due
to their ability to model interactive processes between users and recommender
systems. Numerous approaches have adopted Reinforcement Learning (RL)
algorithms, as these can directly maximize users' cumulative rewards. In IRS,
researchers commonly utilize publicly available review datasets to compare and
evaluate algorithms. However, user feedback provided in public datasets merely
includes instant responses (e.g., a rating), with no inclusion of delayed
responses (e.g., the dwell time and the lifetime value). Thus, the question
remains whether these review datasets are an appropriate choice to evaluate the
long-term effects of the IRS. In this work, we revisited experiments on IRS
with review datasets and compared RL-based models with a simple reward model
that greedily recommends the item with the highest one-step reward. Following
extensive analysis, we can reveal three main findings: First, a simple greedy
reward model consistently outperforms RL-based models in maximizing cumulative
rewards. Second, applying higher weighting to long-term rewards leads to a
degradation of recommendation performance. Third, user feedbacks have mere
long-term effects on the benchmark datasets. Based on our findings, we conclude
that a dataset has to be carefully verified and that a simple greedy baseline
should be included for a proper evaluation of RL-based IRS approaches.

<p class="mathjax">High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a highly challenging task since a large
amount of information is lost due to the limitations of camera sensors. For HDR
imaging, some methods capture multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images with
altering exposures to aggregate more information. However, these approaches
introduce ghosting artifacts when significant inter-frame motions are present.
Moreover, although multi-exposure images are given, we have little information
in severely over-exposed areas. Most existing methods focus on motion
compensation, i.e., alignment of multiple LDR shots to reduce the ghosting
artifacts, but they still produce unsatisfying results. These methods also
rather overlook the need to restore the saturated areas. In this paper, we
generate well-aligned multi-exposure features by reformulating a motion
alignment problem into a simple brightness adjustment problem. In addition, we
propose a coarse-to-fine merging strategy with explicit saturation
compensation. The saturated areas are reconstructed with similar well-exposed
content using adaptive contextual attention. We demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">This research aims to improve the accuracy of complex volleyball predictions
and provide more meaningful insights to coaches and players. We introduce a
specialized graph encoding technique to add additional contact-by-contact
volleyball context to an already available volleyball dataset without any
additional data gathering. We demonstrate the potential benefits of using graph
neural networks (GNNs) on this enriched dataset for three different volleyball
prediction tasks: rally outcome prediction, set location prediction, and hit
type prediction. We compare the performance of our graph-based models to
baseline models and analyze the results to better understand the underlying
relationships in a volleyball rally. Our results show that the use of GNNs with
our graph encoding yields a much more advanced analysis of the data, which
noticeably improves prediction results overall. We also show that these
baseline tasks can be significantly improved with simple adjustments, such as
removing blocked hits. Lastly, we demonstrate the importance of choosing a
model architecture that will better extract the important information for a
certain task. Overall, our study showcases the potential strengths and
weaknesses of using graph encodings in sports data analytics and hopefully will
inspire future improvements in machine learning strategies across sports and
applications by using graphbased encodings.

<p class="mathjax">The success of supervised deep learning models on cell recognition tasks
relies on detailed annotations. Many previous works have managed to reduce the
dependency on labels. However, considering the large number of cells contained
in a patch, costly and inefficient labeling is still inevitable. To this end,
we explored label-free methods for cell recognition. Prior self-activation maps
(PSM) are proposed to generate pseudo masks as training targets. To be
specific, an activation network is trained with self-supervised learning. The
gradient information in the shallow layers of the network is aggregated to
generate prior self-activation maps. Afterward, a semantic clustering module is
then introduced as a pipeline to transform PSMs to pixel-level semantic pseudo
masks for downstream tasks. We evaluated our method on two histological
datasets: MoNuSeg (cell segmentation) and BCData (multi-class cell detection).
Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method
can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations. Our simple
but effective framework can also achieve multi-class cell detection which can
not be done by existing unsupervised methods. The results show the potential of
PSMs that might inspire other research to deal with the hunger for labels in
medical area.

<p class="mathjax">(I) We revisit the algorithmic problem of finding all triangles in a graph
$G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. According to a result of Chiba and
Nishizeki (1985), this task can be achieved by a combinatorial algorithm
running in $O(m \alpha) = O(m^{3/2})$ time, where $\alpha= \alpha(G)$ is the
graph arboricity. We provide a new very simple combinatorial algorithm for
finding all triangles in a graph and show that is amenable to the same running
time analysis. We derive these worst-case bounds from first principles and with
very simple proofs that do not rely on classic results due to Nash-Williams
from the 1960s.
<br />(II) We extend our arguments to the problem of finding all small complete
subgraphs of a given fixed size. We show that the dependency on $m$ and
$\alpha$ in the running time $O(\alpha^{\ell-2} \cdot m)$ of the algorithm of
Chiba and Nishizeki for listing all copies of $K_\ell$, where $\ell \geq 3$, is
asymptotically tight.
<br />(III) We give improved arboricity-sensitive running times for counting and/or
detection of copies of $K_\ell$, for small $\ell \geq 4$. A key ingredient in
our algorithms is, once again, the algorithm of Chiba and Nishizeki. Our new
algorithms are faster than all previous algorithms in certain high-range
arboricity intervals for every $\ell \geq 7$.

<p class="mathjax">The automation of code review activities, a long-standing pursuit in software
engineering, has been primarily addressed by numerous domain-specific
pre-trained models. Despite their success, these models frequently demand
extensive resources for pre-training from scratch. In contrast, Large Language
Models (LLMs) provide an intriguing alternative, given their remarkable
capabilities when supplemented with domain-specific knowledge. However, their
potential for automating code review tasks remains largely unexplored.
<br />In response to this research gap, we present LLaMA-Reviewer, an innovative
framework that leverages the capabilities of LLaMA, a popular LLM, in the realm
of code review. Mindful of resource constraints, this framework employs
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, delivering high performance
while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.
<br />An extensive evaluation of LLaMA-Reviewer is conducted on two diverse,
publicly available datasets. Notably, even with the smallest LLaMA base model
consisting of 6.7B parameters and a limited number of tuning epochs,
LLaMA-Reviewer equals the performance of existing code-review-focused models.
<br />The ablation experiments provide insights into the influence of various
fine-tuning process components, including input representation, instruction
tuning, and different PEFT methods. To foster continuous progress in this
field, the code and all PEFT-weight plugins have been made open-source.

<p class="mathjax">The latest satellite communication (SatCom) missions are characterized by a
fully reconfigurable on-board software-defined payload, capable of adapting
radio resources to the temporal and spatial variations of the system traffic.
As pure optimization-based solutions have shown to be computationally tedious
and to lack flexibility, machine learning (ML)-based methods have emerged as
promising alternatives. We investigate the application of energy-efficient
brain-inspired ML models for on-board radio resource management. Apart from
software simulation, we report extensive experimental results leveraging the
recently released Intel Loihi 2 chip. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed model, we implement conventional convolutional neural networks (CNN)
on a Xilinx Versal VCK5000, and provide a detailed comparison of accuracy,
precision, recall, and energy efficiency for different traffic demands. Most
notably, for relevant workloads, spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on
Loihi 2 yield higher accuracy, while reducing power consumption by more than
100$\times$ as compared to the CNN-based reference platform. Our findings point
to the significant potential of neuromorphic computing and SNNs in supporting
on-board SatCom operations, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and
sustainability in future SatCom systems.

<p class="mathjax">Swarm robotics is envisioned to automate a large number of dirty, dangerous,
and dull tasks. Robots have limited energy, computation capability, and
communication resources. Therefore, current swarm robotics have a small number
of robots, which can only provide limited spatio-temporal information. In this
paper, we propose to leverage the mobile edge computing to alleviate the
computation burden. We develop an effective solution based on a mobility-aware
deep reinforcement learning model at the edge server side for computing
scheduling and resource. Our results show that the proposed approach can meet

<p class="mathjax">Neural force fields (NFFs) have gained prominence in computational chemistry
as surrogate models, superseding quantum-chemistry calculations in ab initio
molecular dynamics. The prevalent benchmark for NFFs has been the MD17 dataset
and its subsequent extension. These datasets predominantly comprise geometries
from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy
surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical
reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We
demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies
in the MD17 datasets, underscoring their inadequacy for representing systems
undergoing chemical reactions. Addressing this sampling limitation, we
introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived
from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces
ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density
functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically
depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset. Our
re-assessment of equivariant models on the xxMD datasets reveals notably higher
mean absolute errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This
observation underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF
model with extrapolation capability. Our proposed xxMD-CASSCF and xxMD-DFT
datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/zpengmei/xxMD}.

<p class="mathjax">Video data and algorithms have been driving advances in multi-object tracking
(MOT). While existing MOT datasets focus on occlusion and appearance
similarity, complex motion patterns are widespread yet overlooked. To address
this issue, we introduce a new dataset called BEE23 to highlight complex
motions. Identity association algorithms have long been the focus of MOT
research. Existing trackers can be categorized into two association paradigms:
single-feature paradigm (based on either motion or appearance feature) and
serial paradigm (one feature serves as secondary while the other is primary).
However, these paradigms are incapable of fully utilizing different features.
In this paper, we propose a parallel paradigm and present the Two rOund
Parallel matchIng meChanism (TOPIC) to implement it. The TOPIC leverages both
motion and appearance features and can adaptively select the preferable one as
the assignment metric based on motion level. Moreover, we provide an
Attention-based Appearance Reconstruct Module (AARM) to reconstruct appearance
feature embeddings, thus enhancing the representation of appearance features.
Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four public datasets and BEE23. Notably, our proposed parallel
paradigm surpasses the performance of existing association paradigms by a large
margin, e.g., reducing false negatives by 12% to 51% compared to the
single-feature association paradigm. The introduced dataset and association
paradigm in this work offers a fresh perspective for advancing the MOT field.

<p class="mathjax">This paper offers a new perspective to ease the challenge of domain
generalization, which involves maintaining robust results even in unseen
environments. Our design focuses on the decision-making process in the final
classifier layer. Specifically, we propose treating the element-wise
contributions to the final results as the rationale for making a decision and
representing the rationale for each sample as a matrix. For a well-generalized
model, we suggest the rationale matrices for samples belonging to the same
category should be similar, indicating the model relies on domain-invariant
clues to make decisions, thereby ensuring robust results. To implement this
idea, we introduce a rationale invariance loss as a simple regularization
technique, requiring only a few lines of code. Our experiments demonstrate that
the proposed approach achieves competitive results across various datasets,
despite its simplicity. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Among the current mainstream change detection networks, transformer is
deficient in the ability to capture accurate low-level details, while
convolutional neural network (CNN) is wanting in the capacity to understand
global information and establish remote spatial relationships. Meanwhile, both
of the widely used early fusion and late fusion frameworks are not able to well
learn complete change features. Therefore, based on swin transformer V2 (Swin
V2) and VGG16, we propose an end-to-end compounded dense network SwinV2DNet to
inherit the advantages of both transformer and CNN and overcome the
shortcomings of existing networks in feature learning. Firstly, it captures the
change relationship features through the densely connected Swin V2 backbone,
and provides the low-level pre-changed and post-changed features through a CNN
branch. Based on these three change features, we accomplish accurate change
detection results. Secondly, combined with transformer and CNN, we propose
mixed feature pyramid (MFP) which provides inter-layer interaction information
and intra-layer multi-scale information for complete feature learning. MFP is a
plug and play module which is experimentally proven to be also effective in
other change detection networks. Further more, we impose a self-supervision
strategy to guide a new CNN branch, which solves the untrainable problem of the
CNN branch and provides the semantic change information for the features of
encoder. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) change detection scores and fine-grained
change maps were obtained compared with other advanced methods on four commonly
used public remote sensing datasets. The code is available at
https://github.com/DalongZ/SwinV2DNet.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained language models of code are now widely used in various software
engineering tasks such as code generation, code completion, vulnerability
detection, etc. This, in turn, poses security and reliability risks to these
models. One of the important threats is \textit{adversarial attacks}, which can
lead to erroneous predictions and largely affect model performance on
downstream tasks. Current adversarial attacks on code models usually adopt
fixed sets of program transformations, such as variable renaming and dead code
insertion, leading to limited attack effectiveness. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
GraphCodeAttack, to better evaluate the robustness of code models. Given a
target code model, GraphCodeAttack automatically mines important code patterns,
which can influence the model's decisions, to perturb the structure of input
code to the model. To do so, GraphCodeAttack uses a set of input source codes
to probe the model's outputs and identifies the \textit{discriminative} ASTs
patterns that can influence the model decisions. GraphCodeAttack then selects
appropriate AST patterns, concretizes the selected patterns as attacks, and
inserts them as dead code into the model's input program. To effectively
synthesize attacks from AST patterns, GraphCodeAttack uses a separate
pre-trained code model to fill in the ASTs with concrete code snippets. We
evaluate the robustness of two popular code models (e.g., CodeBERT and
GraphCodeBERT) against our proposed approach on three tasks: Authorship
Attribution, Vulnerability Prediction, and Clone Detection. The experimental
results suggest that our proposed approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in attacking code models such as CARROT and ALERT.

<p class="mathjax">In recent, some robust contrastive multi-view clustering (MvC) methods have
been proposed, which construct data pairs from neighborhoods to alleviate the
false negative issue, i.e., some intra-cluster samples are wrongly treated as
negative pairs. Although promising performance has been achieved by these
methods, the false negative issue is still far from addressed and the false
positive issue emerges because all in- and out-of-neighborhood samples are
simply treated as positive and negative, respectively. To address the issues,
we propose a novel robust method, dubbed decoupled contrastive multi-view
clustering with high-order random walks (DIVIDE). In brief, DIVIDE leverages
random walks to progressively identify data pairs in a global instead of local
manner. As a result, DIVIDE could identify in-neighborhood negatives and
out-of-neighborhood positives. Moreover, DIVIDE embraces a novel MvC
architecture to perform inter- and intra-view contrastive learning in different
embedding spaces, thus boosting clustering performance and embracing the
robustness against missing views. To verify the efficacy of DIVIDE, we carry
out extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets comparing with nine
state-of-the-art MvC methods in both complete and incomplete MvC settings.

<p class="mathjax">Misalignments between multi-modality images pose challenges in image fusion,
manifesting as structural distortions and edge ghosts. Existing efforts
commonly resort to registering first and fusing later, typically employing two
cascaded stages for registration,i.e., coarse registration and fine
registration. Both stages directly estimate the respective target deformation
fields. In this paper, we argue that the separated two-stage registration is
not compact, and the direct estimation of the target deformation fields is not
accurate enough. To address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modality
Multi-scale Progressive Dense Registration (C-MPDR) scheme, which accomplishes
the coarse-to-fine registration exclusively using a one-stage optimization,
thus improving the fusion performance of misaligned multi-modality images.
Specifically, two pivotal components are involved, a dense Deformation Field
Fusion (DFF) module and a Progressive Feature Fine (PFF) module. The DFF
aggregates the predicted multi-scale deformation sub-fields at the current
scale, while the PFF progressively refines the remaining misaligned features.
Both work together to accurately estimate the final deformation fields. In
addition, we develop a Transformer-Conv-based Fusion (TCF) subnetwork that
considers local and long-range feature dependencies, allowing us to capture
more informative features from the registered infrared and visible images for
the generation of high-quality fused images. Extensive experimental analysis
demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in the fusion of misaligned
cross-modality images.

<p class="mathjax">Impressive performance on point cloud semantic segmentation has been achieved
by fully-supervised methods with large amounts of labelled data. As it is
labour-intensive to acquire large-scale point cloud data with point-wise
labels, many attempts have been made to explore learning 3D point cloud
segmentation with limited annotations. Active learning is one of the effective
strategies to achieve this purpose but is still under-explored. The most recent
methods of this kind measure the uncertainty of each pre-divided region for
manual labelling but they suffer from redundant information and require
additional efforts for region division. This paper aims at addressing this
issue by developing a hierarchical point-based active learning strategy.
Specifically, we measure the uncertainty for each point by a hierarchical
minimum margin uncertainty module which considers the contextual information at
multiple levels. Then, a feature-distance suppression strategy is designed to
select important and representative points for manual labelling. Besides, to
better exploit the unlabelled data, we build a semi-supervised segmentation
framework based on our active strategy. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and
ScanNetV2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 96.5% and
100% performance of fully-supervised baseline with only 0.07% and 0.1% training
data, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and
active learning methods. The code will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Engaging video comments play an important role in video social media, as they
are the carrier of feelings, thoughts, or humor of the audience. Preliminary
works have made initial exploration for video comment generation by adopting
caption-style encoder-decoder models. However, comment generation presents some
unique challenges distinct from caption generation, which makes these methods
somewhat less effective at generating engaging comments. In contrast to the
objective and descriptive nature of captions, comments tend to be inherently
subjective, making it hard to quantify and evaluate the engagement of comments.
Furthermore, the scarcity of truly engaging comments brings difficulty to
collecting enough high-quality training examples. In this paper, we propose
ViCo with three novel designs to tackle the above challenges for generating
engaging Video Comments. Firstly, to quantify the engagement of comments, we
utilize the number of "likes" each comment receives as a proxy of human
preference after an appropriate debiasing procedure. Secondly, to automatically
evaluate the engagement of comments, we train a reward model to align its
judgment to the above proxy. Our user studies indicate that this reward model
effectively aligns with human judgments. Lastly, to alleviate the scarcity of
high-quality comments, an initial generator is trained on readily available but
noisy data to generate comments. Then the reward model is employed to offer
feedback on the generated comments, thus optimizing the initial generator. To
facilitate the research of video commenting, we collect a large video
comment-dataset (ViCo-20k) with rich metadata from a popular video website.
Experiments on ViCo-20k show that the comments generated by our ViCo model
exhibit the best performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative
results, particularly when engagement is considered.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of sequential recommendation (SR) is to predict a user's potential
interested items based on her/his historical interaction sequences. Most
existing sequential recommenders are developed based on ID features, which,
despite their widespread use, often underperform with sparse IDs and struggle
with the cold-start problem. Besides, inconsistent ID mappings hinder the
model's transferability, isolating similar recommendation domains that could
have been co-optimized. This paper aims to address these issues by exploring
the potential of multi-modal information in learning robust and generalizable
sequence representations. We propose MISSRec, a multi-modal pre-training and
transfer learning framework for SR. On the user side, we design a
Transformer-based encoder-decoder model, where the contextual encoder learns to
capture the sequence-level multi-modal synergy while a novel interest-aware
decoder is developed to grasp item-modality-interest relations for better
sequence representation. On the candidate item side, we adopt a dynamic fusion
module to produce user-adaptive item representation, providing more precise
matching between users and items. We pre-train the model with contrastive
learning objectives and fine-tune it in an efficient manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of MISSRec, promising
an practical solution for real-world recommendation scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei in digital histology
play an essential role in computer-assisted cancer diagnosis; however, it
remains challenging. The highest achieved binary and multi-class Panoptic
Quality (PQ) remains as low as 0.68 bPQ and 0.49 mPQ, respectively. It is due
to the higher staining variability, variability across the tissue, rough
clinical conditions, overlapping nuclei, and nuclear class imbalance. The
generic deep-learning methods usually rely on end-to-end models, which fail to
address these problems associated explicitly with digital histology. In our
previous work, DAN-NucNet, we resolved these issues for semantic segmentation
with an end-to-end model. This work extends our previous model to simultaneous
instance segmentation and classification. We introduce additional decoder heads
with independent weighted losses, which produce semantic segmentation, edge
proposals, and classification maps. We use the outputs from the three-head
model to apply post-processing to produce the final segmentation and
classification. Our multi-stage approach utilizes edge proposals and semantic
segmentations compared to direct segmentation and classification strategies
followed by most state-of-the-art methods. Due to this, we demonstrate a
significant performance improvement in producing high-quality instance
segmentation and nuclei classification. We have achieved a 0.841 Dice score for
semantic segmentation, 0.713 bPQ scores for instance segmentation, and 0.633
mPQ for nuclei classification. Our proposed framework is generalized across 19
types of tissues. Furthermore, the framework is less complex compared to the
state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional static user interfaces (UI) have given way to dynamic systems
that can intelligently adapt to and respond to users' changing needs. Temporal
interaction is an emerging field in human-computer interaction (HCI), which
refers to the study and design of UI that are capable of adapting and
responding to the user's changing behavioral and emotional states. By
comprehending and incorporating the temporal component of user interactions, it
focuses on developing dynamic and individualized user experiences. This idea
places a strong emphasis on the value of adjusting to user behavior and
emotions in order to create a more unique and interesting user experience. The
potential of temporal interaction to alter user interface design is highlighted
by this paper's examination of its capacity to adjust to user behavior and
react to emotional states. Designers can create interfaces that respond to the
changing demands, emotions, and behaviors of users by utilizing temporal
interactions. This produces interfaces that are not only highly functional but
also form an emotional connection with the users.

<p class="mathjax">We present Recurrent Fitting (ReFit), a neural network architecture for
single-image, parametric 3D human reconstruction. ReFit learns a
feedback-update loop that mirrors the strategy of solving an inverse problem
through optimization. At each iterative step, it reprojects keypoints from the
human model to feature maps to query feedback, and uses a recurrent-based
updater to adjust the model to fit the image better. Because ReFit encodes
strong knowledge of the inverse problem, it is faster to train than previous
regression models. At the same time, ReFit improves state-of-the-art
performance on standard benchmarks. Moreover, ReFit applies to other
optimization settings, such as multi-view fitting and single-view shape
fitting. Project website: https://yufu-wang.github.io/refit_humans/

<p class="mathjax">Previous research has studied the task of segmenting cinematic videos into
scenes and into narrative acts. However, these studies have overlooked the
essential task of multimodal alignment and fusion for effectively and
efficiently processing long-form videos (&gt;60min). In this paper, we introduce
Multimodal alignmEnt aGgregation and distillAtion (MEGA) for cinematic
long-video segmentation. MEGA tackles the challenge by leveraging multiple
media modalities. The method coarsely aligns inputs of variable lengths and
different modalities with alignment positional encoding. To maintain temporal
synchronization while reducing computation, we further introduce an enhanced
bottleneck fusion layer which uses temporal alignment. Additionally, MEGA
employs a novel contrastive loss to synchronize and transfer labels across
modalities, enabling act segmentation from labeled synopsis sentences on video
shots. Our experimental results show that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on MovieNet dataset for scene segmentation (with an Average Precision
improvement of +1.19%) and on TRIPOD dataset for act segmentation (with a Total
Agreement improvement of +5.51%)

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, working with manually
designed prompts have demonstrated great capacity of transfer learning.
Recently, learnable prompts achieve state-of-the-art performance, which however
are prone to overfit to seen classes, failing to generalize to unseen classes.
In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Prompt Tuning (KAPT) framework for
vision-language models. Our approach takes inspiration from human intelligence
in which external knowledge is usually incorporated into recognizing novel
categories of objects. Specifically, we design two complementary types of
knowledge-aware prompts for the text encoder to leverage the distinctive
characteristics of category-related external knowledge. The discrete prompt
extracts the key information from descriptions of an object category, and the
learned continuous prompt captures overall contexts. We further design an
adaptation head for the visual encoder to aggregate salient attentive visual
cues, which establishes discriminative and task-aware visual representations.
We conduct extensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmark datasets and the
results verify the effectiveness in few-shot image classification, especially
in generalizing to unseen categories. Compared with the state-of-the-art CoCoOp
method, KAPT exhibits favorable performance and achieves an absolute gain of
3.22% on new classes and 2.57% in terms of harmonic mean.

<p class="mathjax">Creating visually pleasing stylized ink paintings from 3D models is a
challenge in robotic manipulation. We propose a semi-automatic framework that
can extract expressive strokes from 3D models and draw them in oriental ink
painting styles by using a robotic arm. The framework consists of a simulation
stage and a robotic drawing stage. In the simulation stage, geometrical
contours were automatically extracted from a certain viewpoint and a neural
network was employed to create simplified contours. Then, expressive digital
strokes were generated after interactive editing according to user's aesthetic
understanding. In the robotic drawing stage, an optimization method was
presented for drawing smooth and physically consistent strokes to the digital
strokes, and two oriental ink painting styles termed as Noutan (shade) and
Kasure (scratchiness) were applied to the strokes by robotic control of a
brush's translation, dipping and scraping. Unlike existing methods that
concentrate on generating paintings from 2D images, our framework has the
advantage of rendering stylized ink paintings from 3D models by using a
consumer-grade robotic arm. We evaluate the proposed framework by taking 3
standard models and a user-defined model as examples. The results show that our
framework is able to draw visually pleasing oriental ink paintings with
expressive strokes.

<p class="mathjax">Error prediction in large language models often relies on domain-specific
information. In this paper, we present measures for quantification of error in
the response of a large language model based on the diversity of responses to a
given prompt - hence independent of the underlying application. We describe how
three such measures - based on entropy, Gini impurity, and centroid distance -
can be employed. We perform a suite of experiments on multiple datasets and
temperature settings to demonstrate that these measures strongly correlate with
the probability of failure. Additionally, we present empirical results
demonstrating how these measures can be applied to few-shot prompting,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and error detection.

<p class="mathjax">Several methods exist today to accelerate Machine Learning(ML) or
Deep-Learning(DL) model performance for training and inference. However, modern
techniques that rely on various graph and operator parallelism methodologies
rely on search space optimizations which are costly in terms of power and
hardware usage. Especially in the case of inference, when the batch size is 1
and execution is on CPUs or for power-constrained edge devices, current
techniques can become costly, complicated or inapplicable. To ameliorate this,
we present a Critical-Path-based Linear Clustering approach to exploit inherent
parallel paths in ML dataflow graphs. Our task parallelization approach further
optimizes the structure of graphs via cloning and prunes them via constant
propagation and dead-code elimination. Contrary to other work, we generate
readable and executable parallel Pytorch+Python code from input ML models in
ONNX format via a new tool that we have built called {\bf Ramiel}. This allows
us to benefit from other downstream acceleration techniques like intra-op
parallelism and potentially pipeline parallelism. Our preliminary results on
several ML graphs demonstrate up to 1.9$\times$ speedup over serial execution
and outperform some of the current mechanisms in both compile and runtimes.
Lastly, our methods are lightweight and fast enough so that they can be used
effectively for power and resource-constrained devices, while still enabling
downstream optimizations.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and ALIGN, are generally trained
on datasets consisting of image-caption pairs obtained from the web. However,
real-world multimodal datasets, such as healthcare data, are significantly more
complex: each image (e.g. X-ray) is often paired with text (e.g. physician
report) that describes many distinct attributes occurring in fine-grained
regions of the image. We refer to these samples as exhibiting high pairwise
complexity, since each image-text pair can be decomposed into a large number of
region-attribute pairings. The extent to which VLMs can capture fine-grained
relationships between image regions and textual attributes when trained on such
data has not been previously evaluated. The first key contribution of this work
is to demonstrate through systematic evaluations that as the pairwise
complexity of the training dataset increases, standard VLMs struggle to learn
region-attribute relationships, exhibiting performance degradations of up to
37% on retrieval tasks. In order to address this issue, we introduce ViLLA as
our second key contribution. ViLLA, which is trained to capture fine-grained
region-attribute relationships from complex datasets, involves two components:
(a) a lightweight, self-supervised mapping model to decompose image-text
samples into region-attribute pairs, and (b) a contrastive VLM to learn
representations from generated region-attribute pairs. We demonstrate with
experiments across four domains (synthetic, product, medical, and natural
images) that ViLLA outperforms comparable VLMs on fine-grained reasoning tasks,
such as zero-shot object detection (up to 3.6 AP50 points on COCO and 0.6 mAP
points on LVIS) and retrieval (up to 14.2 R-Precision points).

<p class="mathjax">This study's first purpose is to provide quantitative evidence that would
incentivize researchers to instead use the more robust method of nested
cross-validation. The second purpose is to present methods and MATLAB codes for
doing power analysis for ML-based analysis during the design of a study. Monte
Carlo simulations were used to quantify the interactions between the employed
cross-validation method, the discriminative power of features, the
dimensionality of the feature space, and the dimensionality of the model. Four
different cross-validations (single holdout, 10-fold, train-validation-test,
and nested 10-fold) were compared based on the statistical power and
statistical confidence of the ML models. Distributions of the null and
alternative hypotheses were used to determine the minimum required sample size
for obtaining a statistically significant outcome ({\alpha}=0.05,
1-\b{eta}=0.8). Statistical confidence of the model was defined as the
probability of correct features being selected and hence being included in the
final model. Our analysis showed that the model generated based on the single
holdout method had very low statistical power and statistical confidence and
that it significantly overestimated the accuracy. Conversely, the nested
10-fold cross-validation resulted in the highest statistical confidence and the
highest statistical power, while providing an unbiased estimate of the
accuracy. The required sample size with a single holdout could be 50% higher
than what would be needed if nested cross-validation were used. Confidence in
the model based on nested cross-validation was as much as four times higher
than the confidence in the single holdout-based model. A computational model,
MATLAB codes, and lookup tables are provided to assist researchers with
estimating the sample size during the design of their future studies.

<p class="mathjax">Hand-object interaction understanding and the barely addressed novel view
synthesis are highly desired in the immersive communication, whereas it is
challenging due to the high deformation of hand and heavy occlusions between
hand and object. In this paper, we propose a neural rendering and pose
estimation system for hand-object interaction from sparse views, which can also
enable 3D hand-object interaction editing. We share the inspiration from recent
scene understanding work that shows a scene specific model built beforehand can
significantly improve and unblock vision tasks especially when inputs are
sparse, and extend it to the dynamic hand-object interaction scenario and
propose to solve the problem in two stages. We first learn the shape and
appearance prior knowledge of hands and objects separately with the neural
representation at the offline stage. During the online stage, we design a
rendering-based joint model fitting framework to understand the dynamic
hand-object interaction with the pre-built hand and object models as well as
interaction priors, which thereby overcomes penetration and separation issues
between hand and object and also enables novel view synthesis. In order to get
stable contact during the hand-object interaction process in a sequence, we
propose a stable contact loss to make the contact region to be consistent.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods. Code and dataset are available in project webpage

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have demonstrated tremendous success not only in the natural
language processing (NLP) domain but also the field of computer vision,
igniting various creative approaches and applications. Yet, the superior
performance and modeling flexibility of transformers came with a severe
increase in computation costs, and hence several works have proposed methods to
reduce this burden. Inspired by a cost-cutting method originally proposed for
language models, Data Multiplexing (DataMUX), we propose a novel approach for
efficient visual recognition that employs additional dim1 batching (i.e.,
concatenation) that greatly improves the throughput with little compromise in
the accuracy. We first introduce a naive adaptation of DataMux for vision
models, Image Multiplexer, and devise novel components to overcome its
weaknesses, rendering our final model, ConcatPlexer, at the sweet spot between
inference speed and accuracy. The ConcatPlexer was trained on ImageNet1K and
CIFAR100 dataset and it achieved 23.5% less GFLOPs than ViT-B/16 with 69.5% and
83.4% validation accuracy, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">RNN-based methods have faced challenges in the Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF) domain when dealing with excessively long look-back windows
and forecast horizons. Consequently, the dominance in this domain has shifted
towards Transformer, MLP, and CNN approaches. The substantial number of
recurrent iterations are the fundamental reasons behind the limitations of RNNs
in LTSF. To address these issues, we propose two novel strategies to reduce the
number of iterations in RNNs for LTSF tasks: Segment-wise Iterations and
Parallel Multi-step Forecasting (PMF). RNNs that combine these strategies,
namely SegRNN, significantly reduce the required recurrent iterations for LTSF,
resulting in notable improvements in forecast accuracy and inference speed.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegRNN not only outperforms SOTA
Transformer-based models but also reduces runtime and memory usage by more than
78%. These achievements provide strong evidence that RNNs continue to excel in
LTSF tasks and encourage further exploration of this domain with more RNN-based
approaches. The source code is coming soon.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot segmentation (FSS) is a dense prediction task that aims to infer the
pixel-wise labels of unseen classes using only a limited number of annotated
images. The key challenge in FSS is to classify the labels of query pixels
using class prototypes learned from the few labeled support exemplars. Prior
approaches to FSS have typically focused on learning class-wise descriptors
independently from support images, thereby ignoring the rich contextual
information and mutual dependencies among support-query features. To address
this limitation, we propose a joint learning method termed Masked Cross-Image
Encoding (MCE), which is designed to capture common visual properties that
describe object details and to learn bidirectional inter-image dependencies
that enhance feature interaction. MCE is more than a visual representation
enrichment module; it also considers cross-image mutual dependencies and
implicit guidance. Experiments on FSS benchmarks PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$
demonstrate the advanced meta-learning ability of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Spatial-temporal data modeling aims to mine the underlying spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies of objects in a system. However, most
existing methods focus on the modeling of spatial-temporal data in a single
mode, lacking the understanding of multiple modes. Though very few methods have
been presented to learn the multi-mode relationships recently, they are built
on complicated components with higher model complexities. In this paper, we
propose a simple framework for multi-mode spatial-temporal data modeling to
bring both effectiveness and efficiency together. Specifically, we design a
general cross-mode spatial relationships learning component to adaptively
establish connections between multiple modes and propagate information along
the learned connections. Moreover, we employ multi-layer perceptrons to capture
the temporal dependencies and channel correlations, which are conceptually and
technically succinct. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our
model can consistently outperform the baselines with lower space and time
complexity, opening up a promising direction for modeling spatial-temporal
data. The generalizability of the cross-mode spatial relationships learning
module is also validated.

<p class="mathjax">Non-blocking search data structures offer scalability with a progress
guarantee on high-performance multi-core architectures. In the recent past,
"learned queries" have gained remarkable attention. It refers to predicting the
rank of a key computed by machine learning models trained to infer the
cumulative distribution function of an ordered dataset. A line of works
exhibits the superiority of learned queries over classical query algorithms.
Yet, to our knowledge, no existing non-blocking search data structure employs
them. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Kanva}, a framework for learned
non-blocking search. Kanva has an intuitive yet non-trivial design: traverse
down a shallow hierarchy of lightweight linear models to reach the
"non-blocking bins," which are dynamic ordered search structures. The proposed
approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art -- non-blocking
interpolation search trees and elimination (a,b) trees -- in many workload and
data distributions. Kanva is provably linearizable.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-modal garment synthesis and manipulation will significantly benefit the
way fashion designers generate garments and modify their designs via flexible
linguistic interfaces.Current approaches follow the general text-to-image
paradigm and mine cross-modal relations via simple cross-attention modules,
neglecting the structural correspondence between visual and textual
representations in the fashion design domain. In this work, we instead
introduce DiffCloth, a diffusion-based pipeline for cross-modal garment
synthesis and manipulation, which empowers diffusion models with flexible
compositionality in the fashion domain by structurally aligning the cross-modal
semantics. Specifically, we formulate the part-level cross-modal alignment as a
bipartite matching problem between the linguistic Attribute-Phrases (AP) and
the visual garment parts which are obtained via constituency parsing and
semantic segmentation, respectively. To mitigate the issue of attribute
confusion, we further propose a semantic-bundled cross-attention to preserve
the spatial structure similarities between the attention maps of attribute
adjectives and part nouns in each AP. Moreover, DiffCloth allows for
manipulation of the generated results by simply replacing APs in the text
prompts. The manipulation-irrelevant regions are recognized by blended masks
obtained from the bundled attention maps of the APs and kept unchanged.
Extensive experiments on the CM-Fashion benchmark demonstrate that DiffCloth
both yields state-of-the-art garment synthesis results by leveraging the
inherent structural information and supports flexible manipulation with region
consistency.

<p class="mathjax">Serverless computing has gained a strong traction in the cloud computing
community in recent years. Among the many benefits of this novel computing
model, the rapid auto-scaling capability of user applications takes prominence.
However, the offer of adhoc scaling of user deployments at function level
introduces many complications to serverless systems. The added delay and
failures in function request executions caused by the time consumed for
dynamically creating new resources to suit function workloads, known as the
cold-start delay, is one such very prevalent shortcoming. Maintaining idle
resource pools to alleviate this issue often results in wasted resources from
the cloud provider perspective. Existing solutions to address this limitation
mostly focus on predicting and understanding function load levels in order to
proactively create required resources. Although these solutions improve
function performance, the lack of understanding on the overall system
characteristics in making these scaling decisions often leads to the
sub-optimal usage of system resources. Further, the multi-tenant nature of
serverless systems requires a scalable solution adaptable for multiple
co-existing applications, a limitation seen in most current solutions. In this
paper, we introduce a novel multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning based
intelligent solution for both horizontal and vertical scaling of function
resources, based on a comprehensive understanding on both function and system
requirements. Our solution elevates function performance reducing cold starts,
while also offering the flexibility for optimizing resource maintenance cost to
the service providers. Experiments conducted considering varying workload
scenarios show improvements of up to 23% and 34% in terms of application
latency and request failures, while also saving up to 45% in infrastructure
cost for the service providers.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel space-rescaling technique for registering dissimilar
physical-virtual spaces by utilizing the effects of adjusting physical space
with redirected walking. Achieving a seamless immersive Virtual Reality (VR)
experience requires overcoming the spatial heterogeneities between the physical
and virtual spaces and accurately aligning the VR environment with the user's
tracked physical space. However, existing space-matching algorithms that rely
on one-to-one scale mapping are inadequate when dealing with highly dissimilar
physical and virtual spaces, and redirected walking controllers could not
utilize basic geometric information from physical space in the virtual space
due to coordinate distortion. To address these issues, we apply relative
translation gains to partitioned space grids based on the main interactable
object's edge, which enables space-adaptive modification effects of physical
space without coordinate distortion. Our evaluation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in aligning the main object's edge, surface, and
wall, as well as securing the largest registered area compared to alternative
methods under all conditions. These findings can be used to create an immersive
play area for VR content where users can receive passive feedback from the
plane and edge in their physical environment.

<p class="mathjax">A growing body of work leverages the Hamiltonian formalism as an inductive
bias for physically plausible neural network based video generation. The
structure of the Hamiltonian ensures conservation of a learned quantity (e.g.,
energy) and imposes a phase-space interpretation on the low-dimensional
manifold underlying the input video. While this interpretation has the
potential to facilitate the integration of learned representations in
downstream tasks, existing methods are limited in their applicability as they
require a structural prior for the configuration space at design time. In this
work, we present a GAN-based video generation pipeline with a learned
configuration space map and Hamiltonian neural network motion model, to learn a
representation of the configuration space from data. We train our model with a
physics-inspired cyclic-coordinate loss function which encourages a minimal
representation of the configuration space and improves interpretability. We
demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our approach on the Hamiltonian
Dynamics Suite Toy Physics dataset.

private domain data to collaboratively train large models for vertical domains,
achieving intelligent services across scenarios. The authors discuss in-depth
the strategic transformation of federated learning in terms of intelligence
foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new
challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost
trade-off, data privacy, and incentive mechanism. The paper elaborates a case
study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge
to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and
efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical
innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and
efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that
enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through
multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city
model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy
infrastructure safety, residential community security, and urban operation
management. The established federated learning cooperation ecosystem is
expected to further aggregate industry, academia, and research resources,
realize large models in multiple vertical domains, and promote the large-scale
industrial application of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge research on
multimodal federated learning.

<p class="mathjax">The field of women's endocrinology has trailed behind data-driven medical
solutions, largely due to concerns over the privacy of patient data. Valuable
datapoints about hormone levels or menstrual cycling could expose patients who
suffer from comorbidities or terminate a pregnancy, violating their privacy. We
explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) to predict the optimal drug
for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a serious hormonal
disorder impacting millions of women worldwide, yet it's poorly understood and
its research is stunted by a lack of patient data. We demonstrate that a
variety of FL approaches succeed on a synthetic PCOS patient dataset. Our
proposed FL models are a tool to access massive quantities of diverse data and
identify the most effective treatment option while providing PCOS patients with
privacy guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">Modern computer vision services often require users to share raw feature
descriptors with an untrusted server. This presents an inherent privacy risk,
as raw descriptors may be used to recover the source images from which they
were extracted. To address this issue, researchers recently proposed
privatizing image features by embedding them within an affine subspace
containing the original feature as well as adversarial feature samples. In this
paper, we propose two novel inversion attacks to show that it is possible to
(approximately) recover the original image features from these embeddings,
allowing us to recover privacy-critical image content. In light of such
successes and the lack of theoretical privacy guarantees afforded by existing
visual privacy methods, we further propose the first method to privatize image
features via local differential privacy, which, unlike prior approaches,
provides a guaranteed bound for privacy leakage regardless of the strength of
the attacks. In addition, our method yields strong performance in visual
localization as a downstream task while enjoying the privacy guarantee.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest within both
academic and industrial. Yet, the application of LLMs to graph data remains
under-explored. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of four LLMs in
addressing several analytical problems with graph data. We employ four distinct
evaluation metrics: Comprehension, Correctness, Fidelity, and Rectification.
Our results show that: 1) LLMs effectively comprehend graph data in natural
language and reason with graph topology. 2) GPT models can generate logical and
coherent results, outperforming alternatives in correctness. 3) All examined
LLMs face challenges in structural reasoning, with techniques like zero-shot
chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting showing diminished efficacy. 4) GPT
models often produce erroneous answers in multi-answer tasks, raising concerns
in fidelity. 5) GPT models exhibit elevated confidence in their outputs,
potentially hindering their rectification capacities. Notably, GPT-4 has
demonstrated the capacity to rectify responses from GPT-3.5-turbo and its own
previous iterations. The code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Information Technology has become a critical component in various industries,
leading to an increased focus on software maintenance and monitoring. With the
complexities of modern software systems, traditional maintenance approaches
have become insufficient. The concept of AIOps has emerged to enhance
predictive maintenance using Big Data and Machine Learning capabilities.
However, exploiting AIOps requires addressing several challenges related to the
complexity of data and incident management. Commercial solutions exist, but
they may not be suitable for certain companies due to high costs, data
governance issues, and limitations in covering private software. This paper
investigates the feasibility of implementing on-premise AIOps solutions by
leveraging open-source tools. We introduce a comprehensive AIOps infrastructure
that we have successfully deployed in our company, and we provide the rationale
behind different choices that we made to build its various components.
Particularly, we provide insights into our approach and criteria for selecting
a data management system and we explain its integration. Our experience can be
beneficial for companies seeking to internally manage their software
maintenance processes with a modern AIOps approach.

<p class="mathjax">Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is a vital technique used in robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles. It combines visual and inertial
measurements to accurately estimate position and orientation. Existing VIO
methods assume a fixed noise covariance for the inertial uncertainty. However,
accurately determining in real-time the noise variance of the inertial sensors
presents a significant challenge as the uncertainty changes throughout the
operation leading to suboptimal performance and reduced accuracy. To circumvent
this, we propose VIO-DualProNet, a novel approach that utilizes deep learning
methods to dynamically estimate the inertial noise uncertainty in real-time. By
designing and training a deep neural network to predict inertial noise
uncertainty using only inertial sensor measurements, and integrating it into
the VINS-Mono algorithm, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in accuracy
and robustness, enhancing VIO performance and potentially benefiting other
VIO-based systems for precise localization and mapping across diverse
conditions.

method that can learn the linearizing controller from a library (a dictionary)
of candidate functions. When the dynamics of the system are known, the method
boils down to solving a set of linear equations. Remarkably, the same idea
extends to the case in which the dynamics of the system are unknown and a
linearizing controller must be found using experimental data. In particular, we
derive a simple condition (checkable from data) to assess when the
linearization property holds over the entire state space of interest and not
just on the dataset used to determine the solution. We also discuss important

<p class="mathjax">We study the fair division of indivisible items with subsidies among $n$
agents, where the absolute marginal valuation of each item is at most one.
Under monotone valuations (where each item is a good), Brustle et al. (2020)
demonstrated that a maximum subsidy of $2(n-1)$ and a total subsidy of
$2(n-1)^2$ are sufficient to guarantee the existence of an envy-freeable
allocation. In this paper, we improve upon these bounds, even in a wider model.
Namely, we show that, given an EF1 allocation, we can compute in polynomial
time an envy-free allocation with a subsidy of at most $n-1$ per agent and a
total subsidy of at most $n(n-1)/2$. Moreover, we present further improved
bounds for monotone valuations.

<p class="mathjax">Visual affordance segmentation identifies the surfaces of an object an agent
can interact with. Common challenges for the identification of affordances are
the variety of the geometry and physical properties of these surfaces as well
as occlusions. In this paper, we focus on occlusions of an object that is
hand-held by a person manipulating it. To address this challenge, we propose an
affordance segmentation model that uses auxiliary branches to process the
object and hand regions separately. The proposed model learns affordance
features under hand-occlusion by weighting the feature map through hand and
object segmentation. To train the model, we annotated the visual affordances of
an existing dataset with mixed-reality images of hand-held containers in
third-person (exocentric) images. Experiments on both real and mixed-reality
images show that our model achieves better affordance segmentation and
generalisation than existing models.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in robotics that
asks us to compute collision-free paths for a team of agents, all moving across
a shared map. Although many works appear on this topic, all current algorithms
struggle as the number of agents grows. The principal reason is that existing
approaches typically plan free-flow optimal paths, which creates congestion. To
tackle this issue we propose a new approach for MAPF where agents are guided to
their destination by following congestion-avoiding paths. We evaluate the idea
in two large-scale settings: one-shot MAPF, where each agent has a single
destination, and lifelong MAPF, where agents are continuously assigned new
tasks. For one-shot MAPF we show that our approach substantially improves
solution quality. For Lifelong MAPF we report large improvements in overall
throughput.

is a technique used to identify tampering in AI models. However, previous
methods have faced challenges including risks of omission, additional
information transmission, and inability to locate tampering precisely. In this
paper, we propose a method for detecting tampered parameters and bits, which
can be used to detect, locate, and restore parameters that have been tampered
with. We also propose an adaptive embedding method that maximizes information
capacity while maintaining model accuracy. Our approach was tested on multiple
neural networks subjected to attacks that modified weight parameters, and our
results demonstrate that our method achieved great recovery performance when
the modification rate was below 20%. Furthermore, for models where watermarking
significantly affected accuracy, we utilized an adaptive bit technique to

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we argue that the next generation of robots can be commanded
using only Language Models' prompts. Every prompt interrogates separately a
specific Robotic Modality via its Modality Language Model (MLM). A central Task
Modality mediates the whole communication to execute the robotic mission via a
Large Language Model (LLM). This paper gives this new robotic design pattern
the name of: Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM). Moreover, this paper applies
this PRM design pattern in building a new robotic framework named
ROSGPT_Vision. ROSGPT_Vision allows the execution of a robotic task using only
two prompts: a Visual and an LLM prompt. The Visual Prompt extracts, in natural
language, the visual semantic features related to the task under consideration
(Visual Robotic Modality). Meanwhile, the LLM Prompt regulates the robotic
reaction to the visual description (Task Modality). The framework automates all
the mechanisms behind these two prompts. The framework enables the robot to
address complex real-world scenarios by processing visual data, making informed
decisions, and carrying out actions automatically. The framework comprises one
generic vision module and two independent ROS nodes. As a test application, we
used ROSGPT_Vision to develop CarMate, which monitors the driver's distraction
on the roads and makes real-time vocal notifications to the driver. We showed
how ROSGPT_Vision significantly reduced the development cost compared to
traditional methods. We demonstrated how to improve the quality of the
application by optimizing the prompting strategies, without delving into
technical details. ROSGPT_Vision is shared with the community (link:
https://github.com/bilel-bj/ROSGPT_Vision) to advance robotic research in this
direction and to build more robotic frameworks that implement the PRM design
pattern and enables controlling robots using only prompts.

results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named SVulD, a
function-level Subtle semantic embedding for Vulnerability Detection along with
intuitive explanations, to alleviate the above limitations. Specifically, SVulD
firstly trains a model to learn distinguishing semantic representations of
functions regardless of their lexical similarity. Then, for the detected
vulnerable functions, SVulD provides natural language explanations (e.g., root
cause) of results to help developers intuitively understand the
vulnerabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of SVulD, we conduct large-scale
experiments on a widely used practical vulnerability dataset and compare it
with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by considering five performance
measures. The experimental results indicate that SVulD outperforms all SOTAs
with a substantial improvement (i.e., 23.5%-68.0% in terms of F1-score,
15.9%-134.8% in terms of PR-AUC and 7.4%-64.4% in terms of Accuracy). Besides,
we conduct a user-case study to evaluate the usefulness of SVulD for developers
on understanding the vulnerable code and the participants' feedback
demonstrates that SVulD is helpful for development practice.

<p class="mathjax">Learning object segmentation in image and video datasets without human
supervision is a challenging problem. Humans easily identify moving salient
objects in videos using the gestalt principle of common fate, which suggests
that what moves together belongs together. Building upon this idea, we propose
a self-supervised object discovery approach that leverages motion and
appearance information to produce high-quality object segmentation masks.
Specifically, we redesign the traditional graph cut on images to include motion
information in a linear combination with appearance information to produce edge
weights. Remarkably, this step produces object segmentation masks comparable to
the current state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks. To further improve
performance, we bootstrap a segmentation network trained on these preliminary
masks as pseudo-ground truths to learn from its own outputs via self-training.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, named LOCATE, on multiple
standard video object segmentation, image saliency detection, and object
segmentation benchmarks, achieving results on par with and, in many cases
surpassing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the transferability of
our approach to novel domains through a qualitative study on in-the-wild
images. Additionally, we present extensive ablation analysis to support our
design choices and highlight the contribution of each component of our proposed
method.

<p class="mathjax">In their seminal work, Broder \textit{et. al.}~\citep{BroderCFM98} introduces
the $\mathrm{minHash}$ algorithm that computes a low-dimensional sketch of
high-dimensional binary data that closely approximates pairwise Jaccard
similarity. Since its invention, $\mathrm{minHash}$ has been commonly used by
practitioners in various big data applications. Further, the data is dynamic in
many real-life scenarios, and their feature sets evolve over time. We consider
the case when features are dynamically inserted and deleted in the dataset. We
note that a naive solution to this problem is to repeatedly recompute
$\mathrm{minHash}$ with respect to the updated dimension. However, this is an
expensive task as it requires generating fresh random permutations. To the best
of our knowledge, no systematic study of $\mathrm{minHash}$ is recorded in the
context of dynamic insertion and deletion of features. In this work, we
initiate this study and suggest algorithms that make the $\mathrm{minHash}$
sketches adaptable to the dynamic insertion and deletion of features. We show a
rigorous theoretical analysis of our algorithms and complement it with
extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Empirically we observe a
significant speed-up in the running time while simultaneously offering
comparable performance with respect to running $\mathrm{minHash}$ from scratch.
Our proposal is efficient, accurate, and easy to implement in practice.

<p class="mathjax">3D scene graphs hierarchically represent the environment appropriately
organizing different environmental entities in various layers. Our previous
work on situational graphs extends the concept of 3D scene graph to SLAM by
tightly coupling the robot poses with the scene graph entities, achieving
state-of-the-art results. Though, one of the limitations of S-Graphs is
scalability in really large environments due to the increased graph size over
time, increasing the computational complexity.
<br />To overcome this limitation in this work we present an initial research of an
improved version of S-Graphs exploiting the hierarchy to reduce the graph size
by marginalizing redundant robot poses and their connections to the
observations of the same structural entities. Firstly, we propose the
generation and optimization of room-local graphs encompassing all graph
entities within a room-like structure. These room-local graphs are used to
compress the S-Graphs marginalizing the redundant robot keyframes within the
given room. We then perform windowed local optimization of the compressed graph
at regular time-distance intervals. A global optimization of the compressed
graph is performed every time a loop closure is detected. We show similar
accuracy compared to the baseline while showing a 39.81% reduction in the
computation time with respect to the baseline.

<p class="mathjax">Many real-world applications, from sport analysis to surveillance, benefit
from automatic long-term action recognition. In the current deep learning
paradigm for automatic action recognition, it is imperative that models are
trained and tested on datasets and tasks that evaluate if such models actually
learn and reason over long-term information. In this work, we propose a method
to evaluate how suitable a video dataset is to evaluate models for long-term
action recognition. To this end, we define a long-term action as excluding all
the videos that can be correctly recognized using solely short-term
information. We test this definition on existing long-term classification tasks
on three popular real-world datasets, namely Breakfast, CrossTask and LVU, to
determine if these datasets are truly evaluating long-term recognition. Our
study reveals that these datasets can be effectively solved using shortcuts
based on short-term information. Following this finding, we encourage long-term
action recognition researchers to make use of datasets that need long-term
information to be solved.

<p class="mathjax">Fault diagnosis is an essential component in process supervision. Indeed, it
determines which kind of fault has occurred, given that it has been previously
detected, allowing for appropriate intervention. Automatic fault diagnosis
systems use machine learning for predicting the fault type from sensor
readings. Nonetheless, these models are sensible to changes in the data
distributions, which may be caused by changes in the monitored process, such as
changes in the mode of operation. This scenario is known as Cross-Domain Fault
Diagnosis (CDFD). We provide an extensive comparison of single and multi-source
unsupervised domain adaptation (SSDA and MSDA respectively) algorithms for
CDFD. We study these methods in the context of the Tennessee-Eastmann Process,
a widely used benchmark in the chemical industry. We show that using multiple
domains during training has a positive effect, even when no adaptation is
employed. As such, the MSDA baseline improves over the SSDA baseline
classification accuracy by 23% on average. In addition, under the
multiple-sources scenario, we improve classification accuracy of the no
adaptation setting by 8.4% on average.

<p class="mathjax">Previous work on long-term video action recognition relies on deep
3D-convolutional models that have a large temporal receptive field (RF). We
argue that these models are not always the best choice for temporal modeling in
videos. A large temporal receptive field allows the model to encode the exact
sub-action order of a video, which causes a performance decrease when testing
videos have a different sub-action order. In this work, we investigate whether
we can improve the model robustness to the sub-action order by shrinking the
temporal receptive field of action recognition models. For this, we design
Video BagNet, a variant of the 3D ResNet-50 model with the temporal receptive
field size limited to 1, 9, 17 or 33 frames. We analyze Video BagNet on
synthetic and real-world video datasets and experimentally compare models with
varying temporal receptive fields. We find that short receptive fields are
robust to sub-action order changes, while larger temporal receptive fields are
sensitive to the sub-action order.

<p class="mathjax">Current research on bias in machine learning often focuses on fairness, while
overlooking the roots or causes of bias. However, bias was originally defined
as a "systematic error," often caused by humans at different stages of the
research process. This article aims to bridge the gap between past literature
on bias in research by providing taxonomy for potential sources of bias and
errors in data and models. The paper focus on bias in machine learning
pipelines. Survey analyses over forty potential sources of bias in the machine
learning (ML) pipeline, providing clear examples for each. By understanding the
sources and consequences of bias in machine learning, better methods can be
developed for its detecting and mitigating, leading to fairer, more
transparent, and more accurate ML models.

<p class="mathjax">No-regret algorithms are popular for learning Nash equilibrium (NE) in
two-player zero-sum normal-form games (NFGs) and extensive-form games (EFGs).
Many recent works consider the last-iterate convergence no-regret algorithms.
Among them, the two most famous algorithms are Optimistic Gradient Descent
Ascent (OGDA) and Optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update (OMWU). However, OGDA
has high per-iteration complexity. OMWU exhibits a lower per-iteration
complexity but poorer empirical performance, and its convergence holds only
when NE is unique. Recent works propose a Reward Transformation (RT) framework
for MWU, which removes the uniqueness condition and achieves competitive
performance with OMWU. Unfortunately, RT-based algorithms perform worse than
OGDA under the same number of iterations, and their convergence guarantee is
based on the continuous-time feedback assumption, which does not hold in most
scenarios. To address these issues, we provide a closer analysis of the RT
framework, which holds for both continuous and discrete-time feedback. We
demonstrate that the essence of the RT framework is to transform the problem of
learning NE in the original game into a series of strongly convex-concave
optimization problems (SCCPs). We show that the bottleneck of RT-based
algorithms is the speed of solving SCCPs. To improve the their empirical
performance, we design a novel transformation method to enable the SCCPs can be
solved by Regret Matching+ (RM+), a no-regret algorithm with better empirical
performance, resulting in Reward Transformation RM+ (RTRM+). RTRM+ enjoys
last-iterate convergence under the discrete-time feedback setting. Using the
counterfactual regret decomposition framework, we propose Reward Transformation
CFR+ (RTCFR+) to extend RTRM+ to EFGs. Experimental results show that our
algorithms significantly outperform existing last-iterate convergence
algorithms and RM+ (CFR+).

<p class="mathjax">The semantic parsing-based method is an important research branch for
knowledge-based question answering. It usually generates executable programs
lean upon the question and then conduct them to reason answers over a knowledge
base. Benefit from this inherent mechanism, it has advantages in the
performance and the interpretability. However,traditional semantic parsing
methods usually generate a complete program before executing it, which
struggles with multi-hop question answering over heterogeneous knowledge.
Firstly,a complete multi-hop program relies on multiple heterogeneous
supporting facts, and it is difficult for models to receive these facts
simultaneously. Secondly,these methods ignore the interaction information
between the previous-hop execution result and the current-hop program
generation. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a self-iterative
framework for multi-hop program generation (HopPG) over heterogeneous
knowledge, which leverages the previous-hop execution results to retrieve
supporting facts and generate subsequent programs iteratively. We evaluate our
model on MMQA-T^2. The experimental results show that HopPG outperforms
existing semantic-parsing-based baselines, especially on the multi-hop
questions.

<p class="mathjax">Context: When software is released publicly, it is common to include with it
either the full text of the license or licenses under which it is published, or
a detailed reference to them. Therefore public licenses, including FOSS (free,
open source software) licenses, are usually publicly available in source code
repositories.Objective: To compile a dataset containing as many documents as
possible that contain the text of software licenses, or references to the
license terms. Once compiled, characterize the dataset so that it can be used
for further research, or practical purposes related to license analysis.Method:
Retrieve from Software Heritage-the largest publicly available archive of FOSS
source code-all versions of all files whose names are commonly used to convey
licensing terms. All retrieved documents will be characterized in various ways,
using automated and manual analyses.Results: The dataset consists of 6.9
million unique license files. Additional metadata about shipped license files
is also provided, making the dataset ready to use in various contexts,
including: file length measures, MIME type, SPDX license (detected using
ScanCode), and oldest appearance. The results of a manual analysis of 8102
documents is also included, providing a ground truth for further analysis. The
dataset is released as open data as an archive file containing all deduplicated
license files, plus several portable CSV files with metadata, referencing files
via cryptographic checksums.Conclusions: Thanks to the extensive coverage of
Software Heritage, the dataset presented in this paper covers a very large
fraction of all software licenses for public code. We have assembled a large
body of software licenses, characterized it quantitatively and qualitatively,
and validated that it is mostly composed of licensing information and includes
almost all known license texts. The dataset can be used to conduct empirical
studies on open source licensing, training of automated license classifiers,
natural language processing (NLP) analyses of legal texts, as well as
historical and phylogenetic studies on FOSS licensing. It can also be used in
practice to improve tools detecting licenses in source code.

<p class="mathjax">Generating both plausible and accurate full body avatar motion is the key to
the quality of immersive experiences in mixed reality scenarios. Head-Mounted
Devices (HMDs) typically only provide a few input signals, such as head and
hands 6-DoF. Recently, different approaches achieved impressive performance in
generating full body motion given only head and hands signal. However, to the
best of our knowledge, all existing approaches rely on full hand visibility.
While this is the case when, e.g., using motion controllers, a considerable
proportion of mixed reality experiences do not involve motion controllers and
instead rely on egocentric hand tracking. This introduces the challenge of
partial hand visibility owing to the restricted field of view of the HMD. In
this paper, we propose the first unified approach, HMD-NeMo, that addresses
plausible and accurate full body motion generation even when the hands may be
only partially visible. HMD-NeMo is a lightweight neural network that predicts
the full body motion in an online and real-time fashion. At the heart of
HMD-NeMo is the spatio-temporal encoder with novel temporally adaptable mask
tokens that encourage plausible motion in the absence of hand observations. We
perform extensive analysis of the impact of different components in HMD-NeMo
and introduce a new state-of-the-art on AMASS dataset through our evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose distributed and networked energy management
scenarios to optimize the production and reservation of energy among a set of
distributed energy nodes. In other words, the idea is to optimally allocate the
generated and reserved powers based on nodes' local cost gradient information
while meeting the demand energy. One main concern is the all-time (or anytime)
resource-demand feasibility, implying that at all iterations of the scheduling
algorithm, the balance between the produced power and demand plus reserved
power must hold. The other concern is to design algorithms to tolerate
communication time-delays and changes in the network. Further, one can
incorporate possible model nonlinearity in the algorithm to address both
inherent (e.g., saturation and quantization) and purposefully-added (e.g.,
signum-based) nonlinearities in the model. The proposed optimal allocation
algorithm addresses all the above concerns, while it benefits from possible
features of the distributed (or networked) solutions such as
no-single-node-of-failure and distributed information processing. We show both
the all-time feasibility of the proposed scheme and its convergence under
certain bound on the step-rate using Lyapunov-type proofs.

<p class="mathjax">The robust constrained Markov decision process (RCMDP) is a recent
task-modelling framework for reinforcement learning that incorporates
behavioural constraints and that provides robustness to errors in the
transition dynamics model through the use of an uncertainty set. Simulating
RCMDPs requires computing the worst-case dynamics based on value estimates for
each state, an approach which has previously been used in the Robust
Constrained Policy Gradient (RCPG). Highlighting potential downsides of RCPG
such as not robustifying the full constrained objective and the lack of
incremental learning, this paper introduces two algorithms, called RCPG with
Robust Lagrangian and Adversarial RCPG. RCPG with Robust Lagrangian modifies
RCPG by taking the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian rather than
either the value or the constraint. Adversarial RCPG also formulates the
worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian but learns this directly and
incrementally as an adversarial policy through gradient descent rather than
indirectly and abruptly through constrained optimisation on a sorted value
list. A theoretical analysis first derives the Lagrangian policy gradient for
the policy optimisation of both proposed algorithms and then the adversarial
policy gradient to learn the adversary for Adversarial RCPG. Empirical
experiments injecting perturbations in inventory management and safe navigation
tasks demonstrate the competitive performance of both algorithms compared to
traditional RCPG variants as well as non-robust and non-constrained ablations.
In particular, Adversarial RCPG ranks among the top two performing algorithms
on all tests.

<p class="mathjax">In rectangularly-pulsed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems, constant-amplitude (CA) sequences are desirable to construct
preamble/pilot waveforms to facilitate system parameter identification (SPI).
Orthogonal CA sequences are generally preferred in various SPI applications
like random-access channel identification. However, the number of conventional
orthogonal CA sequences (e.g., Zadoff-Chu sequences) that can be adopted in
cellular communication without causing sequence identification ambiguity is
insufficient. Such insufficiency causes heavy performance degradation for SPI
requiring a large number of identification sequences. Moreover,
rectangularly-pulsed OFDM preamble/pilot waveforms carrying conventional CA
sequences suffer from large power spectral sidelobes and thus exhibit low
spectral compactness. This paper is thus motivated to develop several order-I
CA sequence families which contain more orthogonal CA sequences while endowing
the corresponding OFDM preamble/pilot waveforms with fast-decaying spectral
sidelobes. Since more orthogonal sequences are provided, the developed order-I
CA sequence families can enhance the performance characteristics in SPI
requiring a large number of identification sequences over multipath channels
exhibiting short-delay channel profiles, while composing spectrally compact
OFDM preamble/pilot waveforms.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum-inspired Machine Learning (QiML) is a burgeoning field, receiving
global attention from researchers for its potential to leverage principles of
quantum mechanics within classical computational frameworks. However, current
review literature often presents a superficial exploration of QiML, focusing
instead on the broader Quantum Machine Learning (QML) field. In response to
this gap, this survey provides an integrated and comprehensive examination of
QiML, exploring QiML's diverse research domains including tensor network
simulations, dequantized algorithms, and others, showcasing recent
advancements, practical applications, and illuminating potential future
research avenues. Further, a concrete definition of QiML is established by
analyzing various prior interpretations of the term and their inherent
ambiguities. As QiML continues to evolve, we anticipate a wealth of future
developments drawing from quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and classical
machine learning, enriching the field further. This survey serves as a guide
for researchers and practitioners alike, providing a holistic understanding of
QiML's current landscape and future directions.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has gained
significant popularity due to its success in various cooperative multi-agent
tasks. However, exploration still remains a challenging problem in MARL due to
the partial observability of the agents and the exploration space that can grow
exponentially as the number of agents increases. Firstly, in order to address
the scalability issue of the exploration space, we define a formation-based
equivalence relation on the exploration space and aim to reduce the search
space by exploring only meaningful states in different formations. Then, we
propose a novel formation-aware exploration (FoX) framework that encourages
partially observable agents to visit the states in diverse formations by
guiding them to be well aware of their current formation solely based on their
own observations. Numerical results show that the proposed FoX framework
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on Google
Research Football (GRF) and sparse Starcraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC)
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Physical persons playing the role of car drivers consume data that is sourced
from the Internet and, at the same time, themselves act as sources of relevant
data. It follows that citizens' privacy is potentially at risk while they
drive, hence the need to model privacy threats in this application domain. This
paper addresses the privacy threats by updating a recent threat-modelling
methodology and by tailoring it specifically to the soft privacy target
property, which ensures citizens' full control on their personal data. The
methodology now features the sources of documentation as an explicit variable
that is to be considered. It is demonstrated by including a new version of the
de-facto standard LINDDUN methodology as well as an additional source by ENISA
which is found to be relevant to soft privacy. The main findings are a set of
23 domain-independent threats, 43 domain-specific assets and 525
domain-dependent threats for the target property in the automotive domain.
While these exceed their previous versions, their main value is to offer
self-evident support to at least two arguments. One is that LINDDUN has evolved
much the way our original methodology already advocated because a few of our
previously suggested extensions are no longer outstanding. The other one is
that ENISA's treatment of privacy aboard smart cars should be extended
considerably because our 525 threats fall in the same scope.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity
of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language
captions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA),
capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music
files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to
extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the
MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio
question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music
question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating
question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the
MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The
experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our
designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music
question answering and music caption generation across various metrics,
outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and
offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the challenges of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies
(DANES) community, we develop digital tools for processing cuneiform script
being a 3D script imprinted into clay tablets used for more than three
millennia and at least eight major languages. It consists of thousands of
characters that have changed over time and space. Photographs are the most
common representations usable for machine learning, while ink drawings are
prone to interpretation. Best suited 3D datasets that are becoming available.
We created and used the HeiCuBeDa and MaiCuBeDa datasets, which consist of
around 500 annotated tablets. For our novel OCR-like approach to mixed image
data, we provide an additional mapping tool for transferring annotations
between 3D renderings and photographs. Our sign localization uses a RepPoints
detector to predict the locations of characters as bounding boxes. We use image
data from GigaMesh's MSII (curvature, see https://gigamesh.eu) based rendering,
Phong-shaded 3D models, and photographs as well as illumination augmentation.
The results show that using rendered 3D images for sign detection performs
better than other work on photographs. In addition, our approach gives
reasonably good results for photographs only, while it is best used for mixed
datasets. More importantly, the Phong renderings, and especially the MSII
renderings, improve the results on photographs, which is the largest dataset on
a global scale.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread adoption of DNNs in NLP software has highlighted the need for
robustness. Researchers proposed various automatic testing techniques for
adversarial test cases. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations:
weak error-discovering capabilities, with success rates ranging from 0% to
24.6% for BERT-based NLP software, and time inefficiency, taking 177.8s to
205.28s per test case, making them challenging for time-constrained scenarios.
To address these issues, this paper proposes LEAP, an automated test method
that uses LEvy flight-based Adaptive Particle swarm optimization integrated
with textual features to generate adversarial test cases. Specifically, we
adopt Levy flight for population initialization to increase the diversity of
generated test cases. We also design an inertial weight adaptive update
operator to improve the efficiency of LEAP's global optimization of
high-dimensional text examples and a mutation operator based on the greedy
strategy to reduce the search time. We conducted a series of experiments to
validate LEAP's ability to test NLP software and found that the average success
rate of LEAP in generating adversarial test cases is 79.1%, which is 6.1%
higher than the next best approach (PSOattack). While ensuring high success
rates, LEAP significantly reduces time overhead by up to 147.6s compared to
other heuristic-based methods. Additionally, the experimental results
demonstrate that LEAP can generate more transferable test cases and
significantly enhance the robustness of DNN-based systems.

<p class="mathjax">Popularity bias is a widespread problem in the field of recommender systems,
where popular items tend to dominate recommendation results. In this work, we
propose 'Test Time Embedding Normalization' as a simple yet effective strategy
for mitigating popularity bias, which surpasses the performance of the previous
mitigation approaches by a significant margin. Our approach utilizes the
normalized item embedding during the inference stage to control the influence
of embedding magnitude, which is highly correlated with item popularity.
Through extensive experiments, we show that our method combined with the
sampled softmax loss effectively reduces popularity bias compare to previous
approaches for bias mitigation. We further investigate the relationship between
user and item embeddings and find that the angular similarity between
embeddings distinguishes preferable and non-preferable items regardless of
their popularity. The analysis explains the mechanism behind the success of our
approach in eliminating the impact of popularity bias. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate multi-user modular extremely large-scale
multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication systems, where modular
extremely large-scale uniform linear array (XL-ULA) is deployed at the base
station (BS) to serve multiple single-antenna users. By exploiting the unique
modular array architecture and considering the potential near-field
propagation, we develop sub-array based uniform spherical wave (USW) models for
distinct versus common angles of arrival/departure (AoAs/AoDs) with respect to
different sub-arrays/modules, respectively. Under such USW models, we analyze
the beam focusing patterns at the near-field observation location by using
near-field beamforming. The analysis reveals that compared to the conventional
XL-MIMO with collocated antenna elements, modular XL-MIMO can provide better
spatial resolution by benefiting from its larger array aperture. However, it
also incurs undesired grating lobes due to the large inter-module separation.
Moreover, it is found that for multi-user modular XL-MIMO communications, the
achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for users may be
degraded by the grating lobes of the beam focusing pattern. To address this
issue, an efficient user grouping method is proposed for multi-user
transmission scheduling, so that users located within the grating lobes of each
other are not allocated to the same time-frequency resource block (RB) for
their communications. Numerical results are presented to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed user grouping method, as well as the superior
performance of modular XL-MIMO over its collocated counterpart with densely
distributed users.

<p class="mathjax">The quality of a wood log in the wood industry depends heavily on the
presence of both outer and inner defects, including inner knots that are a
result of the growth of tree branches. Today, locating the inner knots require
the use of expensive equipment such as X-ray scanners. In this paper, we
address the task of predicting the location of inner defects from the outer
shape of the logs. The dataset is built by extracting both the contours and the
knots with X-ray measurements. We propose to solve this binary segmentation
task by leveraging convolutional recurrent neural networks. Once the neural
network is trained, inference can be performed from the outer shape measured

<p class="mathjax">Determining the degree of confidence of deep learning model in its prediction
is an open problem in the field of natural language processing. Most of the
classical methods for uncertainty estimation are quite weak for text
classification models. We set the task of obtaining an uncertainty estimate for
neural networks based on the Transformer architecture. A key feature of such
mo-dels is the attention mechanism, which supports the information flow between
the hidden representations of tokens in the neural network. We explore the
formed relationships between internal representations using Topological Data
Analysis methods and utilize them to predict model's confidence. In this paper,
we propose a method for uncertainty estimation based on the topological
properties of the attention mechanism and compare it with classical methods. As
a result, the proposed algorithm surpasses the existing methods in quality and
opens up a new area of application of the attention mechanism, but requires the
selection of topological features.

<p class="mathjax">Information bottleneck (IB) is a paradigm to extract information in one
target random variable from another relevant random variable, which has aroused
great interest due to its potential to explain deep neural networks in terms of
information compression and prediction. Despite its great importance, finding
the optimal bottleneck variable involves a difficult nonconvex optimization
problem due to the nonconvexity of mutual information constraint. The
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm and its variants provide an approach by considering
its Lagrangian with fixed Lagrange multiplier. However, only the strictly
concave IB curve can be fully obtained by the BA algorithm, which strongly
limits its application in machine learning and related fields, as strict
concavity cannot be guaranteed in those problems. To overcome the above
difficulty, we derive an entropy regularized optimal transport (OT) model for
IB problem from a posterior probability perspective. Correspondingly, we use
the alternating optimization procedure and generalize the Sinkhorn algorithm to
solve the above OT model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are
demonstrated via numerical experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a pathological condition characterized by
bleeding inside the skull or brain, which can be attributed to various factors.
Identifying, localizing and quantifying ICH has important clinical
implications, in a bleed-dependent manner. While deep learning techniques are
widely used in medical image segmentation and have been applied to the ICH
segmentation task, existing public ICH datasets do not support the multi-class
segmentation problem. To address this, we develop the Brain Hemorrhage
Segmentation Dataset (BHSD), which provides a 3D multi-class ICH dataset
containing 192 volumes with pixel-level annotations and 2200 volumes with
slice-level annotations across five categories of ICH. To demonstrate the
utility of the dataset, we formulate a series of supervised and semi-supervised
ICH segmentation tasks. We provide experimental results with state-of-the-art
models as reference benchmarks for further model developments and evaluations
on this dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Humans effortlessly infer the 3D shape of objects. What computations underlie
this ability? Although various computational models have been proposed, none of
them capture the human ability to match object shape across viewpoints. Here,
we ask whether and how this gap might be closed. We begin with a relatively
novel class of computational models, 3D neural fields, which encapsulate the
basic principles of classic analysis-by-synthesis in a deep neural network
(DNN). First, we find that a 3D Light Field Network (3D-LFN) supports 3D
matching judgments well aligned to humans for within-category comparisons,
adversarially-defined comparisons that accentuate the 3D failure cases of
standard DNN models, and adversarially-defined comparisons for algorithmically
generated shapes with no category structure. We then investigate the source of
the 3D-LFN's ability to achieve human-aligned performance through a series of
computational experiments. Exposure to multiple viewpoints of objects during
training and a multi-view learning objective are the primary factors behind
model-human alignment; even conventional DNN architectures come much closer to
human behavior when trained with multi-view objectives. Finally, we find that
while the models trained with multi-view learning objectives are able to
partially generalize to new object categories, they fall short of human
alignment. This work provides a foundation for understanding human shape
inferences within neurally mappable computational architectures and highlights
important questions for future work.

system. Programmable in-network computing device has great potential to deploy
DL for network models, however, existing device cannot afford to run a DL

in computing power, task granularity, model generality and feature extracting.
<br />To address above problems, we propose Octopus: a heterogeneous in-network

designed for fast and efficient feature extracting. Vector accelerator and
systolic array work in a heterogeneous collaborative way, offering
low-latency-highthroughput general computing ability for packet-and-flow-based
tasks. Octopus also contains on-chip memory fabric for storage and connecting,
and Risc-V core for global controlling. The proposed Octopus accelerator design
is implemented on FPGA. Functionality and performance of Octopus are validated
in several use-cases, achieving performance of 31Mpkt/s feature extracting,
207ns packet-based computing latency, and 90kflow/s flow-based computing

<p class="mathjax">Signal detection in large multiple-input multiple-output (large-MIMO) systems
presents greater challenges compared to conventional massive-MIMO for two
primary reasons. First, large-MIMO systems lack favorable propagation
conditions as they do not require a substantially greater number of service
antennas relative to user antennas. Second, the wireless channel may exhibit
spatial non-stationarity when an extremely large aperture array (ELAA) is
deployed in a large-MIMO system. In this paper, we propose a scalable iterative
large-MIMO detector named ANPID, which simultaneously delivers 1) close to
maximum-likelihood detection performance, 2) low computational-complexity
(i.e., square-order of transmit antennas), 3) fast convergence, and 4)
robustness to the spatial non-stationarity in ELAA channels. ANPID incorporates
a damping demodulation step into stationary iterative (SI) methods and
alternates between two distinct demodulated SI methods. Simulation results
demonstrate that ANPID fulfills all the four features concurrently and
outperforms existing low-complexity MIMO detectors, especially in highly-loaded
large MIMO systems.

<p class="mathjax">Existing visual tracking methods typically take an image patch as the
reference of the target to perform tracking. However, a single image patch
cannot provide a complete and precise concept of the target object as images
are limited in their ability to abstract and can be ambiguous, which makes it
difficult to track targets with drastic variations. In this paper, we propose
the CiteTracker to enhance target modeling and inference in visual tracking by
connecting images and text. Specifically, we develop a text generation module
to convert the target image patch into a descriptive text containing its class
and attribute information, providing a comprehensive reference point for the
target. In addition, a dynamic description module is designed to adapt to
target variations for more effective target representation. We then associate
the target description and the search image using an attention-based
correlation module to generate the correlated features for target state
reference. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets are conducted to
evaluate the proposed algorithm and the favorable performance against the
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
tracking method.

<p class="mathjax">Current video object detection (VOD) models often encounter issues with
over-aggregation due to redundant aggregation strategies, which perform feature
aggregation on every frame. This results in suboptimal performance and
increased computational complexity. In this work, we propose an image-level
Object Detection Difficulty (ODD) metric to quantify the difficulty of
detecting objects in a given image. The derived ODD scores can be used in the
VOD process to mitigate over-aggregation. Specifically, we train an ODD
predictor as an auxiliary head of a still-image object detector to compute the
ODD score for each image based on the discrepancies between detection results
and ground-truth bounding boxes. The ODD score enhances the VOD system in two
ways: 1) it enables the VOD system to select superior global reference frames,
thereby improving overall accuracy; and 2) it serves as an indicator in the
newly designed ODD Scheduler to eliminate the aggregation of frames that are
easy to detect, thus accelerating the VOD process. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that, when utilized for selecting global reference frames, ODD-VOD
consistently enhances the accuracy of Global-frame-based VOD models. When
employed for acceleration, ODD-VOD consistently improves the frames per second
(FPS) by an average of 73.3% across 8 different VOD models without sacrificing
accuracy. When combined, ODD-VOD attains state-of-the-art performance when
competing with many VOD methods in both accuracy and speed. Our work represents
a significant advancement towards making VOD more practical for real-world
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Both horizontal interleaving as well as the sum-rank metric are currently
attractive topics in the field of code-based cryptography, as they could
mitigate the problem of large key sizes. In contrast to vertical interleaving,
where codewords are stacked vertically, each codeword of a horizontally
$s$-interleaved code is the horizontal concatenation of $s$ codewords of $s$
component codes. In the case of horizontally interleaved linearized
Reed-Solomon (HILRS) codes, these component codes are chosen to be linearized
Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes.
<br />We provide a Gao-like decoder for HILRS codes that is inspired by the
respective works for non-interleaved Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes. By
applying techniques from the theory of minimal approximant bases, we achieve a
complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(s^{2.373} n^{1.635})$ operations in
$\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, where $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ neglects logarithmic
factors, $s$ is the interleaving order and $n$ denotes the length of the
component codes. For reasonably small interleaving order $s \ll n$, this is
subquadratic in the component-code length $n$ and improves over the only known
syndrome-based decoder for HILRS codes with quadratic complexity. Moreover, it
closes the performance gap to vertically interleaved LRS codes for which a
decoder of complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(s^{2.373} n^{1.635})$ is already
known.
<br />We can decode beyond the unique-decoding radius and handle errors of sum-rank
weight up to $\frac{s}{s + 1} (n - k)$ for component-code dimension $k$. We
also give an upper bound on the failure probability in the zero-derivation
setting and validate its tightness via Monte Carlo simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Visualizing the insights of the invisible music is able to bring listeners an
enjoyable and immersive listening experience, and therefore has attracted much
attention in the field of information visualization. Over the past decades,
various music visualization techniques have been introduced. However, most of
them are manually designed by following the visual encoding rules, thus shown
in form of a graphical visual representation whose visual encoding schema is
usually taking effort to understand. Recently, some researchers use figures or
illustrations to represent music moods, lyrics, and musical features, which are
more intuitive and attractive. However, in these techniques, the figures are
usually pre-selected or statically generated, so they cannot precisely convey
insights of different pieces of music. To address this issue, in this paper, we
introduce MusicJam, a music visualization system that is able to generate
narrative illustrations to represent the insight of the input music. The system
leverages a novel generation model designed based on GPT-2 to generate
meaningful lyrics given the input music and then employs the stable diffusion
model to transform the lyrics into coherent illustrations. Finally, the
generated results are synchronized and rendered as an MP4 video accompanied by
the input music. We evaluated the proposed lyric generation model by comparing
it to the baseline models and conducted a user study to estimate the quality of
the generated illustrations and the final music videos. The results showed the
power of our technique.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-modal pre-training has shown impressive performance on a wide range of
downstream tasks, benefiting from massive image-text pairs collected from the
Internet. In practice, online data are growing constantly, highlighting the
importance of the ability of pre-trained model to learn from data that is
continuously growing. Existing works on cross-modal pre-training mainly focus
on training a network with fixed architecture. However, it is impractical to
limit the model capacity when considering the continuously growing nature of
pre-training data in real-world applications. On the other hand, it is
important to utilize the knowledge in the current model to obtain efficient
training and better performance. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
propose GrowCLIP, a data-driven automatic model growing algorithm for
contrastive language-image pre-training with continuous image-text pairs as
input. Specially, we adopt a dynamic growth space and seek out the optimal
architecture at each growth step to adapt to online learning scenarios. And the
shared encoder is proposed in our growth space to enhance the degree of
cross-modal fusion. Besides, we explore the effect of growth in different
dimensions, which could provide future references for the design of cross-modal
model architecture. Finally, we employ parameter inheriting with momentum (PIM)
to maintain the previous knowledge and address the issue of the local minimum
dilemma. Compared with the existing methods, GrowCLIP improves 2.3% average
top-1 accuracy on zero-shot image classification of 9 downstream tasks. As for
zero-shot image retrieval, GrowCLIP can improve 1.2% for top-1 image-to-text
recall on Flickr30K dataset.

<p class="mathjax">As a distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) enables
large-scale clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw
data. However, due to the lack of data auditing for untrusted clients, FL is
vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially backdoor attacks. By using poisoned
data for local training or directly changing the model parameters, attackers
can easily inject backdoors into the model, which can trigger the model to make
misclassification of targeted patterns in images. To address these issues, we
propose a novel data-free trigger-generation-based defense approach based on
the two characteristics of backdoor attacks: i) triggers are learned faster
than normal knowledge, and ii) trigger patterns have a greater effect on image
classification than normal class patterns. Our approach generates the images
with newly learned knowledge by identifying the differences between the old and
new global models, and filters trigger images by evaluating the effect of these
generated images. By using these trigger images, our approach eliminates
poisoned models to ensure the updated global model is benign. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can defend against almost all the
existing types of backdoor attacks and outperform all the seven
state-of-the-art defense methods with both IID and non-IID scenarios.
Especially, our approach can successfully defend against the backdoor attack
even when 80\% of the clients are malicious.

<p class="mathjax">Mixed-precision neural networks (MPNNs) that enable the use of just enough
data width for a deep learning task promise significant advantages of both
inference accuracy and computing overhead. FPGAs with fine-grained
reconfiguration capability can adapt the processing with distinct data width
and models, and hence, can theoretically unleash the potential of MPNNs.
Nevertheless, commodity DPUs on FPGAs mostly emphasize generality and have
limited support for MPNNs especially the ones with lower data width. In
addition, primitive DSPs in FPGAs usually have much larger data width than that
is required by MPNNs and haven't been sufficiently co-explored with MPNNs yet.
To this end, we propose an open source MPNN accelerator design framework
specifically tailored for FPGAs. In this framework, we have a systematic
DSP-packing algorithm to pack multiple lower data width MACs in a single
primitive DSP and enable efficient implementation of MPNNs. Meanwhile, we take
DSP packing efficiency into consideration with MPNN quantization within a
unified neural network architecture search (NAS) framework such that it can be
aware of the DSP overhead during quantization and optimize the MPNN performance
and accuracy concurrently. Finally, we have the optimized MPNN fine-tuned to a
fully pipelined neural network accelerator template based on HLS and make best
use of available resources for higher performance. Our experiments reveal the
resulting accelerators produced by the proposed framework can achieve
overwhelming advantages in terms of performance, resource utilization, and
inference accuracy for MPNNs when compared with both handcrafted counterparts
and prior hardware-aware neural network accelerators on FPGAs.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (NNs) are considered a powerful tool for balancing the
performance and complexity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers
due to their accurate feature extraction, high parallelism, and excellent
inference ability. Graph NNs (GNNs) have recently demonstrated outstanding
capability in learning enhanced message passing rules and have shown success in
overcoming the drawback of inaccurate Gaussian approximation of expectation
propagation (EP)-based MIMO detectors. However, the application of the
GNN-enhanced EP detector to MIMO turbo receivers is underexplored and
non-trivial due to the requirement of extrinsic information for iterative
processing. This paper proposes a GNN-enhanced EP algorithm for MIMO turbo
receivers, which realizes the turbo principle of generating extrinsic
information from the MIMO detector through a specially designed training
procedure. Additionally, an edge pruning strategy is designed to eliminate
redundant connections in the original fully connected model of the GNN
utilizing the correlation information inherently from the EP algorithm. Edge
pruning reduces the computational cost dramatically and enables the network to
focus more attention on the weights that are vital for performance. Simulation
results and complexity analysis indicate that the proposed MIMO turbo receiver
outperforms the EP turbo approaches by over 1 dB at the bit error rate of
$10^{-5}$, exhibits performance equivalent to state-of-the-art receivers with
2.5 times shorter running time, and adapts to various scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning serves as a potent tool for modeling dynamic user
interests within recommender systems, garnering increasing research attention
of late. However, a significant drawback persists: its poor data efficiency,
stemming from its interactive nature. The training of reinforcement
learning-based recommender systems demands expensive online interactions to
amass adequate trajectories, essential for agents to learn user preferences.
This inefficiency renders reinforcement learning-based recommender systems a
formidable undertaking, necessitating the exploration of potential solutions.
Recent strides in offline reinforcement learning present a new perspective.
Offline reinforcement learning empowers agents to glean insights from offline
datasets and deploy learned policies in online settings. Given that recommender
systems possess extensive offline datasets, the framework of offline
reinforcement learning aligns seamlessly. Despite being a burgeoning field,
works centered on recommender systems utilizing offline reinforcement learning
remain limited. This survey aims to introduce and delve into offline
reinforcement learning within recommender systems, offering an inclusive review
of existing literature in this domain. Furthermore, we strive to underscore
prevalent challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, poised to propel
research in this evolving field.

ProAgent excels at cooperative reasoning with the capacity to dynamically adapt

facilitating seamless integration to address a wide array of coordination
scenarios. Experimental evaluations conducted within the framework of
\textit{Overcook-AI} unveil the remarkable performance superiority of ProAgent,
outperforming five methods based on self-play and population-based training in
cooperation with AI agents. Further, when cooperating with human proxy models,
its performance exhibits an average improvement exceeding 10\% compared to the
current state-of-the-art, COLE. The advancement was consistently observed
across diverse scenarios involving interactions with both AI agents of varying
characteristics and human counterparts. These findings inspire future research
for human-robot collaborations. For a hands-on demonstration, please visit

considered for Earth surface classification. Specifically, the integration of
Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data is carried out through supervised

<p class="mathjax">Exploration strategies in continuous action space are often heuristic due to
the infinite actions, and these kinds of methods cannot derive a general
conclusion. In prior work, it has been shown that policy-based exploration is
beneficial for continuous action space in deterministic policy reinforcement
learning(DPRL). However, policy-based exploration in DPRL has two prominent
issues: aimless exploration and policy divergence, and the policy gradient for
exploration is only sometimes helpful due to inaccurate estimation. Based on
the double-Q function framework, we introduce a novel exploration strategy to
mitigate these issues, separate from the policy gradient. We first propose the
greedy Q softmax update schema for Q value update. The expected Q value is
derived by weighted summing the conservative Q value over actions, and the
weight is the corresponding greedy Q value. Greedy Q takes the maximum value of
the two Q functions, and conservative Q takes the minimum value of the two
different Q functions. For practicality, this theoretical basis is then
extended to allow us to combine action exploration with the Q value update,
except for the premise that we have a surrogate policy that behaves like this
exploration policy. In practice, we construct such an exploration policy with a
few sampled actions, and to meet the premise, we learn such a surrogate policy
by minimizing the KL divergence between the target policy and the exploration
policy constructed by the conservative Q. We evaluate our method on the Mujoco
benchmark and demonstrate superior performance compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods across various environments, particularly in the most
complex Humanoid environment.

<p class="mathjax">Given the long textual product information and the product image, Multi-Modal
Product Summarization (MMPS) aims to attract customers' interest and increase
their desire to purchase by highlighting product characteristics with a short
textual summary. Existing MMPS methods have achieved promising performance.
Nevertheless, there still exist several problems: 1) lack end-to-end product
summarization, 2) lack multi-grained multi-modal modeling, and 3) lack
multi-modal attribute modeling. To address these issues, we propose an
end-to-end multi-grained multi-modal attribute-aware product summarization
method (M3PS) for generating high-quality product summaries in e-commerce. M3PS
jointly models product attributes and generates product summaries. Meanwhile,
we design several multi-grained multi-modal tasks to better guide the
multi-modal learning of M3PS. Furthermore, we model product attributes based on
both text and image modalities so that multi-modal product characteristics can
be manifested in the generated summaries. Extensive experiments on a real
large-scale Chinese e-commence dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms
state-of-the-art product summarization methods w.r.t. several summarization
metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Collecting diverse sets of training images for RGB-D semantic image
segmentation is not always possible. In particular, when robots need to operate
in privacy-sensitive areas like homes, the collection is often limited to a
small set of locations. As a consequence, the annotated images lack diversity
in appearance and approaches for RGB-D semantic image segmentation tend to
overfit the training data. In this paper, we thus introduce semantic RGB-D
image synthesis to address this problem. It requires synthesising a
realistic-looking RGB-D image for a given semantic label map. Current
approaches, however, are uni-modal and cannot cope with multi-modal data.
Indeed, we show that extending uni-modal approaches to multi-modal data does
not perform well. In this paper, we therefore propose a generator for
multi-modal data that separates modal-independent information of the semantic
layout from the modal-dependent information that is needed to generate an RGB
and a depth image, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a discriminator that
ensures semantic consistency between the label maps and the generated images
and perceptual similarity between the real and generated images. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous uni-modal methods by a large margin and that the accuracy of an
approach for RGB-D semantic segmentation can be significantly improved by
mixing real and generated images during training.

<p class="mathjax">Continual Learning (CL) involves training a machine learning model in a
sequential manner to learn new information while retaining previously learned
tasks without the presence of previous training data. Although there has been
significant interest in CL, most recent CL approaches in computer vision have
focused on convolutional architectures only. However, with the recent success
of vision transformers, there is a need to explore their potential for CL.
Although there have been some recent CL approaches for vision transformers,
they either store training instances of previous tasks or require a task
identifier during test time, which can be limiting. This paper proposes a new
exemplar-free approach for class/task incremental learning called ConTraCon,
which does not require task-id to be explicitly present during inference and
avoids the need for storing previous training instances. The proposed approach
leverages the transformer architecture and involves re-weighting the key,
query, and value weights of the multi-head self-attention layers of a
transformer trained on a similar task. The re-weighting is done using
convolution, which enables the approach to maintain low parameter requirements
per task. Additionally, an image augmentation-based entropic task
identification approach is used to predict tasks without requiring task-ids
during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms several competitive approaches while requiring
fewer parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for many fine-grained tasks
including temporal action segmentation. An interesting question that is still
open is how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance.
While transformers can model the long-term context of a video, this becomes
computationally prohibitive for long videos. Recent works on temporal action
segmentation thus combine temporal convolutional networks with self-attentions
that are computed only for a local temporal window. While these approaches show
good results, their performance is limited by their inability to capture the
full context of a video. In this work, we try to answer how much long-term
temporal context is required for temporal action segmentation by introducing a
transformer-based model that leverages sparse attention to capture the full
context of a video. We compare our model with the current state of the art on
three datasets for temporal action segmentation, namely 50Salads, Breakfast,
and Assembly101. Our experiments show that modeling the full context of a video
is necessary to obtain the best performance for temporal action segmentation.

nonlinear time-dependent thermo-mechanical equations of inhomogeneous shells
possessing temperature-dependent material properties and orthogonal periodic
configurations. The first contribution is that a novel higher-order macro-micro
coupled computational model is rigorously devised via multi-scale asymptotic
technique and Taylor series approach for high-accuracy simulation of
heterogeneous shells. Benefitting from the higher-order corrected terms, the
higher-order multi-scale computational model keeps the conservation of local
energy and momentum for nonlinear thermo-mechanical simulation. Moreover, a
global error estimation with explicit rate of higher-order multi-scale
solutions is first derived in the energy norm sense. Furthermore, an efficient
space-time numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is presented in
detail. Adequate numerical experiments are conducted to confirm the competitive
advantages of the presented multi-scale approach, exhibiting not only the
exceptional numerical accuracy, but also the less computational expense for
heterogeneous shells.

<p class="mathjax">Super-resolution (SR) networks have been investigated for a while, with their
mobile and lightweight versions gaining noticeable popularity recently.
Quantization, the procedure of decreasing the precision of network parameters
(mostly FP32 to INT8), is also utilized in SR networks for establishing mobile
compatibility. This study focuses on a very important but mostly overlooked
post-training quantization (PTQ) step: representative dataset (RD), which
adjusts the quantization range for PTQ. We propose a novel pipeline (clip-free
quantization pipeline, CFQP) backed up with extensive experimental
justifications to cleverly augment RD images by only using outputs of the FP32
model. Using the proposed pipeline for RD, we can successfully eliminate
unwanted clipped activation layers, which nearly all mobile SR methods utilize
to make the model more robust to PTQ in return for a large overhead in runtime.
Removing clipped activations with our method significantly benefits overall
increased stability, decreased inference runtime up to 54% on some SR models,
better visual quality results compared to INT8 clipped models - and outperforms
even some FP32 non-quantized models, both in runtime and visual quality,
without the need for retraining with clipped activation.

<p class="mathjax">Object-centric representations using slots have shown the advances towards
efficient, flexible and interpretable abstraction from low-level perceptual
features in a compositional scene. Current approaches randomize the initial
state of slots followed by an iterative refinement. As we show in this paper,
the random slot initialization significantly affects the accuracy of the final
slot prediction. Moreover, current approaches require a predetermined number of
slots from prior knowledge of the data, which limits the applicability in the
real world. In our work, we initialize the slot representations with clustering
algorithms conditioned on the perceptual input features. This requires an
additional layer in the architecture to initialize the slots given the
identified clusters. We design permutation invariant and permutation
equivariant versions of this layer to enable the exchangeable slot
representations after clustering. Additionally, we employ mean-shift clustering
to automatically identify the number of slots for a given scene. We evaluate
our method on object discovery and novel view synthesis tasks with various
datasets. The results show that our method outperforms prior works
consistently, especially for complex scenes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the overwhelming computational resources needed with
standard numerical approaches to simulate architected materials. Those
multiscale heterogeneous lattice structures gain intensive interest in
conjunction with the improvement of additive manufacturing as they offer, among
many others, excellent stiffness-to-weight ratios. We develop here a dedicated
HPC solver that benefits from the specific nature of the underlying problem in
order to drastically reduce the computational costs (memory and time) for the
full fine-scale analysis of lattice structures. Our purpose is to take
advantage of the natural domain decomposition into cells and, even more
importantly, of the geometrical and mechanical similarities among cells. Our
solver consists in a so-called inexact FETI-DP method where the local,
cell-wise operators and solutions are approximated with reduced order modeling
techniques. Instead of considering independently every cell, we end up with
only few principal local problems to solve and make use of the corresponding
principal cell-wise operators to approximate all the others. It results in a
scalable algorithm that saves numerous local factorizations. Our solver is
applied for the isogeometric analysis of lattices built by spline composition,
which offers the opportunity to compute the reduced basis with macro-scale
data, thereby making our method also multiscale and matrix-free. The solver is
tested against various 2D and 3D analyses. It shows major gains with respect to
black-box solvers; in particular, problems of several millions of degrees of
freedom can be solved with a simple computer within few minutes.

<p class="mathjax">Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas have been used to describe complex tasks
for multi-agent systems, with both spatial and temporal constraints. However,
since the planning complexity grows exponentially with the number of agents and
the length of the task formula, existing applications are mostly limited to
small artificial cases. To address this issue, a new planning algorithm is
proposed for task formulas specified as sc-LTL formulas. It avoids two common
bottlenecks in the model-checking-based planning methods, i.e., (i) the direct
translation of the complete task formula to the associated B\"uchi automaton;
and (ii) the synchronized product between the B\"uchi automaton and the
transition models of all agents. In particular, each conjuncted sub-formula is
first converted to the associated R-posets as an abstraction of the temporal
dependencies among the subtasks. Then, an efficient algorithm is proposed to
compute the product of these R-posets, which retains their dependencies and
resolves potential conflicts. Furthermore, the proposed approach is applied to
dynamic scenes where new tasks are generated online. It is capable of deriving
the first valid plan with a polynomial time and memory complexity w.r.t. the
system size and the formula length. Our method can plan for task formulas with
a length of more than 60 and a system with more than 35 agents, while most
existing methods fail at the formula length of 20. The proposed method is
validated on large fleets of service robots in both simulation and hardware
experiments.

<p class="mathjax">We propose Boundary-RL, a novel weakly supervised segmentation method that
utilises only patch-level labels for training. We envision the segmentation as
a boundary detection problem, rather than a pixel-level classification as in
previous works. This outlook on segmentation may allow for boundary delineation
under challenging scenarios such as where noise artefacts may be present within
the region-of-interest (ROI) boundaries, where traditional pixel-level
classification-based weakly supervised methods may not be able to effectively
segment the ROI. Particularly of interest, ultrasound images, where intensity
values represent acoustic impedance differences between boundaries, may also
benefit from the boundary delineation approach. Our method uses reinforcement
learning to train a controller function to localise boundaries of ROIs using a
reward derived from a pre-trained boundary-presence classifier. The classifier
indicates when an object boundary is encountered within a patch, as the
controller modifies the patch location in a sequential Markov decision process.
The classifier itself is trained using only binary patch-level labels of object
presence, which are the only labels used during training of the entire boundary
delineation framework, and serves as a weak signal to inform the boundary
delineation. The use of a controller function ensures that a sliding window
over the entire image is not necessary. It also prevents possible
false-positive or -negative cases by minimising number of patches passed to the
boundary-presence classifier. We evaluate our proposed approach for a
clinically relevant task of prostate gland segmentation on trans-rectal
ultrasound images. We show improved performance compared to other tested weakly
supervised methods, using the same labels e.g., multiple instance learning.

<p class="mathjax">We present Colordag, a blockchain protocol where following the prescribed
strategy is, with high probability, a best response as long as all miners have
less than 1/2 of the mining power. We prove the correctness of Colordag even if
there is an extremely powerful adversary who knows future actions of the
scheduler: specifically, when agents will generate blocks and when messages
will arrive. The state-of-the-art protocol, Fruitchain, is an epsilon-Nash
equilibrium as long as all miners have less than 1/2 of the mining power.
However, there is a simple deviation that guarantees that deviators are never
worse off than they would be by following Fruitchain, and can sometimes do
better. Thus, agents are motivated to deviate. Colordag implements a solution
concept that we call epsilon-sure Nash equilibrium and does not suffer from
this problem. Because it is an epsilon-sure Nash equilibrium, Colordag is an
epsilon Nash equilibrium and with probability (1 - epsilon) is a best response.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech
recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The
model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the
speaker's voice from background noise, along with an ASR module. Through this
approach, the model is able to decrease the word error rate (WER) of ASR from
80% to 26.4%. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to
variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create
anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning
strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5%
in joint tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Rail detection is one of the key factors for intelligent train. In the paper,
motivated by the anchor line-based lane detection methods, we propose a rail
detection network called DALNet based on dynamic anchor line. Aiming to solve
the problem that the predefined anchor line is image agnostic, we design a
novel dynamic anchor line mechanism. It utilizes a dynamic anchor line
generator to dynamically generate an appropriate anchor line for each rail
instance based on the position and shape of the rails in the input image. These
dynamically generated anchor lines can be considered as better position
references to accurately localize the rails than the predefined anchor lines.
In addition, we present a challenging urban rail detection dataset DL-Rail with
high-quality annotations and scenario diversity. DL-Rail contains 7000 pairs of
images and annotations along with scene tags, and it is expected to encourage
the development of rail detection. We extensively compare DALNet with many
competitive lane methods. The results show that our DALNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on our DL-Rail rail detection dataset and the
popular Tusimple and LLAMAS lane detection benchmarks. The code will be
released at \url{https://github.com/Yzichen/mmLaneDet}.

<p class="mathjax">While not all researchers prioritize social impact, it is undeniably a
crucial aspect that adds significance to their work. The objective of this
paper is to explore potential gender differences in the social attention paid
to researchers and to examine their association with specific fields of study.
To achieve this goal, the paper analyzes four dimensions of social influence
and examines three measures of social attention to researchers. The dimensions
are media influence (mentions in mainstream news), political influence
(mentions in public policy reports), social media influence (mentions in
Twitter), and educational influence (mentions in Wikipedia). The measures of
social attention to researchers are: proportion of publications with social
mentions (social attention orientation), mentions per publication (level of
social attention), and mentions per mentioned publication (intensity of social
attention). By analyzing the rankings of authors -- for the four dimensions
with the three measures in the 22 research fields of the Web of Science
database -- and by using Spearman correlation coefficients, we conclude that:
1) significant differences are observed between fields; 2) the dimensions
capture different and independent aspects of the social impact. Finally, we use
non-parametric means comparison tests to detect gender bias in social
attention. We conclude that for most fields and dimensions with enough non-zero
altmetrics data, gender differences in social attention are not predominant,
but are still present and vary across fields.

<p class="mathjax">Investigations of causality in operational systems aim at providing
human-understandable explanations of why a system behaves as it does. There is,
in particular, a demand to explain what went wrong on a given counterexample
execution that shows that a system does not satisfy a given specification. To
this end, this paper investigates a notion of counterfactual causality in
transition systems based on Stalnaker's and Lewis' semantics of counterfactuals
in terms of most similar possible worlds and introduces a novel corresponding
notion of counterfactual causality in two-player games. Using distance
functions between paths in transition systems, this notion defines whether
reaching a certain set of states is a cause for the violation of a reachability
or safety property. Similarly, using distance functions between memoryless
strategies in reachability and safety games, it is defined whether reaching a
set of states is a cause for the fact that a given strategy for the player
under investigation is losing. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: In
transition systems, it is shown that counterfactual causality can be checked in
polynomial time for three prominent distance functions between paths. In
two-player games, the introduced notion of counterfactual causality is shown to
be checkable in polynomial time for two natural distance functions between
memoryless strategies. Further, a notion of explanation that can be extracted
from a counterfactual cause and that pinpoints changes to be made to the given
strategy in order to transform it into a winning strategy is defined. For the
two distance functions under consideration, the problem to decide whether such
an explanation imposes only minimal necessary changes to the given strategy
with respect to the used distance function turns out to be coNP-complete and
not to be solvable in polynomial time if P is not equal to NP, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">The development of fair and ethical AI systems requires careful consideration
of bias mitigation, an area often overlooked or ignored. In this study, we
introduce a novel and efficient approach for addressing biases called Targeted
Data Augmentation (TDA), which leverages classical data augmentation techniques
to tackle the pressing issue of bias in data and models. Unlike the laborious
task of removing biases, our method proposes to insert biases instead,
resulting in improved performance. To identify biases, we annotated two diverse
datasets: a dataset of clinical skin lesions and a dataset of male and female
faces. These bias annotations are published for the first time in this study,
providing a valuable resource for future research. Through Counterfactual Bias
Insertion, we discovered that biases associated with the frame, ruler, and
glasses had a significant impact on models. By randomly introducing biases
during training, we mitigated these biases and achieved a substantial decrease
in bias measures, ranging from two-fold to more than 50-fold, while maintaining
a negligible increase in the error rate.

<p class="mathjax">Non-functional properties, such as runtime or memory use, are important to
mobile app users and developers, as they affect user experience. Previous work
on automated improvement of non-functional properties in mobile apps failed to
address the inherent trade-offs between such properties. We propose a practical
approach and the first open-source tool, GIDroid (2023), for multi-objective
automated improvement of Android apps. In particular, we use Genetic
improvement, a search-based technique that navigates the space of software
variants to find improved software. We use a simulation-based testing framework
to greatly improve the speed of search. GIDroid contains three state-of-the-art
multi-objective algorithms, and two new mutation operators, which cache the
results of method calls. Genetic improvement relies on testing to validate
patches. Previous work showed that tests in open-source Android applications
are scarce. We thus wrote tests for 21 versions of 7 Android apps, creating a
new benchmark for performance improvements. We used GIDroid to improve versions
of mobile apps where developers had previously found improvements to runtime,
memory, and bandwidth use. Our technique automatically re-discovers 64% of
existing improvements. We then applied our approach to current versions of
software in which there were no known improvements. We were able to improve
execution time by up to 35%, and memory use by up to 33% in these apps.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic multi-scale modeling and simulation for nonlinear
thermo-mechanical problems of composite materials with complicated random
microstructures remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we develop a novel
statistical higher-order multi-scale (SHOMS) method for nonlinear
thermo-mechanical simulation of random composite materials, which is designed
to overcome limitations of prohibitive computation involving the macro-scale
and micro-scale. By virtue of statistical multi-scale asymptotic analysis and
Taylor series method, the SHOMS computational model is rigorously derived for
accurately analyzing nonlinear thermo-mechanical responses of random composite
materials both in the macro-scale and micro-scale. Moreover, the local error
analysis of SHOMS solutions in the point-wise sense clearly illustrates the
crucial indispensability of establishing the higher-order asymptotic corrected
terms in SHOMS computational model for keeping the conservation of local energy
and momentum. Then, the corresponding space-time multi-scale numerical
algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is designed to efficiently simulate
nonlinear thermo-mechanical behaviors of random composite materials. Finally,
extensive numerical experiments are presented to gauge the efficiency and
accuracy of the proposed SHOMS approach.

<p class="mathjax">In literature, NAND and NOR are two logic gates that display functional
completeness, hence regarded as Universal gates. So, the present effort is
focused on exploring a library of universal gates in binary that are still
unexplored in literature along with a broad and systematic approach to classify
the logic connectives. The study shows that the number of Universal Gates in
any logic system grows exponentially with the number of input variables $N$. It
is revealed that there are $56$ Universal gates in binary for $N=3$. It is
shown that the ratio of the count of Universal gates to the total number of
Logic gates is $\approx $ $\frac{1}{4}$ or 0.25. Adding constants $0,1$ allow
for the creation of $4$ additional (for $N=2$) and $169$ additional Universal
Gates (for $N=3$). In this article, the mathematical and logical underpinnings
of the concept of universal logic gates are presented, along with a search
strategy $ULG_{SS}$ exploring multiple paths leading to their identification. A
fast-track approach has been introduced that uses the hexadecimal
representation of a logic gate to quickly ascertain its attribute.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn widespread attention and research due
to their astounding performance in tasks such as text generation and reasoning.
Derivative products, like ChatGPT, have been extensively deployed and highly
sought after. Meanwhile, the evaluation and optimization of LLMs in software
engineering tasks, such as code generation, have become a research focus.
However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the application and
evaluation of LLMs in the field of software engineering. Therefore, this paper
is the first to comprehensively investigate and collate the research and
products combining LLMs with software engineering, aiming to answer two
questions: (1) What are the current integrations of LLMs with software
engineering? (2) Can LLMs effectively handle software engineering tasks? To
find the answers, we have collected related literature as extensively as
possible from seven mainstream databases, and selected 123 papers for analysis.
We have categorized these papers in detail and reviewed the current research
status of LLMs from the perspective of seven major software engineering tasks,
hoping this will help researchers better grasp the research trends and address
the issues when applying LLMs. Meanwhile, we have also organized and presented
papers with evaluation content to reveal the performance and effectiveness of
LLMs in various software engineering tasks, providing guidance for researchers
and developers to optimize.

<p class="mathjax">Given $k$ input graphs $G_1, \dots ,G_k$, where each pair $G_i$, $G_j$ with
$i \neq j$ shares the same graph $G$, the problem Simultaneous Embedding With
Fixed Edges (SEFE) asks whether there exists a planar drawing for each input
graph such that all drawings coincide on $G$. While SEFE is still open for the
case of two input graphs, the problem is NP-complete for $k \geq 3$ [Schaefer,
JGAA 13]. In this work, we explore the parameterized complexity of SEFE. We
show that SEFE is FPT with respect to $k$ plus the vertex cover number or the
feedback edge set number of the the union graph $G^\cup = G_1 \cup \dots \cup
G_k$. Regarding the shared graph $G$, we show that SEFE is NP-complete, even if
$G$ is a tree with maximum degree 4. Together with a known NP-hardness
reduction [Angelini et al., TCS 15], this allows us to conclude that several
parameters of $G$, including the maximum degree, the maximum number of degree-1
neighbors, the vertex cover number, and the number of cutvertices are
intractable. We also settle the tractability of all pairs of these parameters.
We give FPT algorithms for the vertex cover number plus either of the first two
parameters and for the number of cutvertices plus the maximum degree, whereas
we prove all remaining combinations to be intractable.

<p class="mathjax">Resource allocation is of crucial importance in wireless communications.
However, it is extremely challenging to design efficient resource allocation
schemes for future wireless communication networks since the formulated
resource allocation problems are generally non-convex and consist of various
coupled variables. Moreover, the dynamic changes of practical wireless
communication environment and user service requirements thirst for efficient
real-time resource allocation. To tackle these issues, a novel partially
observable deep multi-agent active inference (PODMAI) framework is proposed for
realizing intelligent resource allocation. A belief based learning method is
exploited for updating the policy by minimizing the variational free energy. A
decentralized training with a decentralized execution multi-agent strategy is
designed to overcome the limitations of the partially observable state
information. Exploited the proposed framework, an intelligent spectrum
allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is developed for a spectrum
sharing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with dynamic transmission rate
requirements as an example. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed
framework can significantly improve the sum transmission rate of the secondary
network compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the convergence speed
of the proposed PODMAI is significantly improved compared with the conventional
reinforcement learning framework. Overall, our proposed framework can enrich
the intelligent resource allocation frameworks and pave the way for realizing
real-time resource allocation.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of next generation wireless systems (5G/6G and beyond) at the
physical layer is primarily driven by the choice of digital modulation
techniques that are bandwidth and power efficient, while maintaining high data
rates. Achievable rates for Gaussian input and some finite constellations
(BPSK/QPSK/QAM) are well studied in the literature. However, new variants of
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) such as Cross-QAM (XQAM), Star-QAM
(S-QAM), Amplitude and phase shift keying (APSK), and Hexagonal Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation (H-QAM) are not studied in the context of achievable rates
for meeting the demand of high data rates. In this paper, we study achievable
rate region for different variants of M-QAM like Cross-QAM, H-QAM, Star-QAM and
APSK. We also compute mutual information corresponding to the sum rate of
Gaussian Multiple Access Channel (G-MAC), for hybrid constellation scheme,
e.g., user 1 transmits using Star-QAM and user 2 by H-QAM. From the results, it
is observed that S-QAM gives the maximum sum-rate when users transmit same
constellations. Also, it has been found that when hybrid constellation is used,
the combination of Star-QAM \&amp; H-QAM gives the maximum rate. In the next part
of the paper, we consider a scenario wherein an adversary is also present at
the receiver side and is trying to decode the information. We model this
scenario as Gaussian Multiple Access Wiretap Channel (G-MAW-WT). We then
compute the achievable secrecy sum rate of two user G-MAC-WT with discrete
inputs from different variants of QAM (viz, X-QAM, H-QAM and S-QAM).It has been
found that at higher values of SNR, S-QAM gives better values of SSR than the
other variants. For hybrid inputs of QAM, at lower values of SNR, combination
of APSK and S-QAM gives better results and at higher values of SNR, combination
of HQAM and APSK gives greater value of SSR.

<p class="mathjax">Given the escalating risks of malicious attacks in the finance sector and the
consequential severe damage, a thorough understanding of adversarial strategies
and robust defense mechanisms for machine learning models is critical. The
threat becomes even more severe with the increased adoption in banks more
accurate, but potentially fragile neural networks. We aim to investigate the
current state and dynamics of adversarial attacks and defenses for neural
network models that use sequential financial data as the input.
<br />To achieve this goal, we have designed a competition that allows realistic
and detailed investigation of problems in modern financial transaction data.
The participants compete directly against each other, so possible attacks and
defenses are examined in close-to-real-life conditions. Our main contributions
are the analysis of the competition dynamics that answers the questions on how
important it is to conceal a model from malicious users, how long does it take
to break it, and what techniques one should use to make it more robust, and
introduction additional way to attack models or increase their robustness.
<br />Our analysis continues with a meta-study on the used approaches with their
power, numerical experiments, and accompanied ablations studies. We show that
the developed attacks and defenses outperform existing alternatives from the
literature while being practical in terms of execution, proving the validity of
the competition as a tool for uncovering vulnerabilities of machine learning
models and mitigating them in various domains.

<p class="mathjax">Creating high quality and realistic materials in computer graphics is a
challenging and time-consuming task, which requires great expertise. In this
paper, we present MatFuse, a novel unified approach that harnesses the
generative power of diffusion models (DM) to simplify the creation of SVBRDF
maps. Our DM-based pipeline integrates multiple sources of conditioning, such
as color palettes, sketches, and pictures, enabling fine-grained control and
flexibility in material synthesis. This design allows for the combination of
diverse information sources (e.g., sketch + image embedding), enhancing
creative possibilities in line with the principle of compositionality. We
demonstrate the generative capabilities of the proposed method under various
conditioning settings; on the SVBRDF estimation task, we show that our method
yields performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting relational triples (subject, predicate, object) from text enables
the transformation of unstructured text data into structured knowledge. The
named entity recognition (NER) and the relation extraction (RE) are two
foundational subtasks in this knowledge generation pipeline. The integration of
subtasks poses a considerable challenge due to their disparate nature. This
paper presents a novel approach that converts the triple extraction task into a
graph labeling problem, capitalizing on the structural information of
dependency parsing and graph recursive neural networks (GRNNs). To integrate
subtasks, this paper proposes a dynamic feedback forest algorithm that connects
the representations of subtasks by inference operations during model training.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Brand, Ganian and Simonov introduced a parameterized refinement of
the classical PAC-learning sample complexity framework. A crucial outcome of
their investigation is that for a very wide range of learning problems, there
is a direct and provable correspondence between fixed-parameter
PAC-learnability (in the sample complexity setting) and the fixed-parameter
tractability of a corresponding "consistency checking" search problem (in the
setting of computational complexity). The latter can be seen as generalizations
of classical search problems where instead of receiving a single instance, one
receives multiple yes- and no-examples and is tasked with finding a solution
which is consistent with the provided examples.
<br />Apart from a few initial results, consistency checking problems are almost
entirely unexplored from a parameterized complexity perspective. In this
article, we provide an overview of these problems and their connection to
parameterized sample complexity, with the primary aim of facilitating further
research in this direction. Afterwards, we establish the fixed-parameter
(in)-tractability for some of the arguably most natural consistency checking
problems on graphs, and show that their complexity-theoretic behavior is
surprisingly very different from that of classical decision problems. Our new
results cover consistency checking variants of problems as diverse as (k-)Path,
Matching, 2-Coloring, Independent Set and Dominating Set, among others.

scene is captured with a high-end laser scanner at sub-millimeter resolution,
along with registered 33-megapixel images from a DSLR camera, and RGB-D streams
from an iPhone. Scene reconstructions are further annotated with an open
vocabulary of semantics, with label-ambiguous scenarios explicitly annotated
for comprehensive semantic understanding. ScanNet++ enables a new real-world

<p class="mathjax">We study deregulated power markets with strategic power suppliers. In
deregulated markets, each supplier submits its supply function (i.e., the
amount of electricity it is willing to produce at various prices) to the
independent system operator (ISO), who based on the submitted supply functions,
dispatches the suppliers to clear the market with minimal total generation
cost. If all suppliers reported their true marginal cost functions as supply
functions, the market outcome would be efficient (i.e., the total generation
cost is minimized). However, when suppliers are strategic and aim to maximize
their own profits, the reported supply functions are not necessarily the true
marginal cost functions, and the resulting market outcome may be inefficient.
The efficiency loss depends crucially on the topology of the underlying
transmission network. This paper provides an analytical upper bound of the
efficiency loss due to strategic suppliers, and proves that the bound is tight
under a large class of transmission networks (i.e., weakly cyclic networks).
Our upper bound sheds light on how the efficiency loss depends on the
transmission network topology (e.g., the degrees of nodes, the admittances and
flow limits of transmission lines).

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformers have shown unprecedented levels of performance in
tackling various visual perception tasks in recent years. However, the
architectural and computational complexity of such network architectures have
made them challenging to deploy in real-world applications with
high-throughput, low-memory requirements. As such, there has been significant
research recently on the design of efficient vision transformer architectures.
In this study, we explore the generation of fast vision transformer
architecture designs via generative architecture search (GAS) to achieve a
strong balance between accuracy and architectural and computational efficiency.
Through this generative architecture search process, we create TurboViT, a
highly efficient hierarchical vision transformer architecture design that is
generated around mask unit attention and Q-pooling design patterns. The
resulting TurboViT architecture design achieves significantly lower
architectural computational complexity (&gt;2.47$\times$ smaller than FasterViT-0
while achieving same accuracy) and computational complexity (&gt;3.4$\times$ fewer
FLOPs and 0.9% higher accuracy than MobileViT2-2.0) when compared to 10 other
state-of-the-art efficient vision transformer network architecture designs
within a similar range of accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore,
TurboViT demonstrated strong inference latency and throughput in both
low-latency and batch processing scenarios (&gt;3.21$\times$ lower latency and
&gt;3.18$\times$ higher throughput compared to FasterViT-0 for low-latency
scenario). These promising results demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging
generative architecture search for generating efficient transformer
architecture designs for high-throughput scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Library migration, which re-implements the same software behavior by using a
different library instead of using the current one, has been widely observed in
software evolution. One essential part of library migration is to find an
analogical API that could provide the same functionality as current ones.
However, given the large number of libraries/APIs, manually finding an
analogical API could be very time-consuming and error-prone. Researchers have
developed multiple automated analogical API recommendation techniques.
Documentation-based methods have particularly attracted significant interest.
Despite their potential, these methods have limitations, such as a lack of
comprehensive semantic understanding in documentation and scalability
challenges. In this work, we propose KGE4AR, a novel documentation-based
approach that leverages knowledge graph (KG) embedding to recommend analogical
APIs during library migration. Specifically, KGE4AR proposes a novel unified
API KG to comprehensively and structurally represent three types of knowledge
in documentation, which can better capture the high-level semantics. Moreover,
KGE4AR then proposes to embed the unified API KG into vectors, enabling more
effective and scalable similarity calculation. We build KGE4AR' s unified API
KG for 35,773 Java libraries and assess it in two API recommendation scenarios:
with and without target libraries. Our results show that KGE4AR substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art documentation-based techniques in both evaluation
scenarios in terms of all metrics (e.g., 47.1%-143.0% and 11.7%-80.6% MRR
improvements in each scenario). Additionally, we explore KGE4AR' s scalability,
confirming its effective scaling with the growing number of libraries.

<p class="mathjax">The future of the arts and artificial intelligence (AI) is promising as
technology advances. As the use of AI in design becomes more widespread, art
practice may not be a human-only art form and could instead become a digitally
integrated experience. With enhanced creativity and collaboration, arts and AI
could work together towards creating artistic outputs that are visually
appealing and meet the needs of the artist and viewer. While it is uncertain
how far the integration will go, arts and AI will likely influence one another.
This workshop pictorial puts forward first-person research that shares
interactions between an HCI researcher and AI as they try to escape the
creative block. The pictorial paper explores two questions: How can AI support
artists' creativity, and what does it mean to be explainable in this context?
HIs, ChatGPT and Midjourney were engaged; the result was a series of
reflections that require further discussion and explorations in the XAIxArts
community: Transparency of attribution, the creation process, ethics of asking,
and inspiration vs copying.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research topic in the academic
community. Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents
with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges
significantly from the human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard
to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast
amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an
upsurge in studies investigating autonomous agents based on LLMs. To harness
the full potential of LLMs, researchers have devised diverse agent
architectures tailored to different applications. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the
field of autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, our
focus lies in the construction of LLM-based agents, for which we propose a
unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work.
Additionally, we provide a summary of the various applications of LLM-based AI
agents in the domains of social science, natural science, and engineering.
Lastly, we discuss the commonly employed evaluation strategies for LLM-based AI
agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and
future directions in this field. To keep track of this field and continuously
update our survey, we maintain a repository for the related references at
https://github.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey.

<p class="mathjax">Existing kinematic skeleton-based 3D human pose estimation methods only
predict joint positions. Although this is sufficient to compute the yaw and
pitch of the bone rotations, the roll around the axis of the bones remains
unresolved by these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D lifting
Graph Convolution Network named PoseGraphNet++ to predict the complete human
pose including the joint positions and the bone orientations. We employ node
and edge convolutions to utilize the joint and bone features. Our model is
evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, and its performance is either on par
with or better than the state-of-the-art in terms of both position and rotation
metrics. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that PoseGraphNet++
benefits from exploiting the mutual relationship between the joints and the
bones.

<p class="mathjax">Latest methods represent shapes with open surfaces using unsigned distance
functions (UDFs). They train neural networks to learn UDFs and reconstruct
surfaces with the gradients around the zero level set of the UDF. However, the
differential networks struggle from learning the zero level set where the UDF
is not differentiable, which leads to large errors on unsigned distances and
gradients around the zero level set, resulting in highly fragmented and
discontinuous surfaces. To resolve this problem, we propose to learn a more
continuous zero level set in UDFs with level set projections. Our insight is to
guide the learning of zero level set using the rest non-zero level sets via a
projection procedure. Our idea is inspired from the observations that the
non-zero level sets are much smoother and more continuous than the zero level
set. We pull the non-zero level sets onto the zero level set with gradient
constraints which align gradients over different level sets and correct
unsigned distance errors on the zero level set, leading to a smoother and more
continuous unsigned distance field. We conduct comprehensive experiments in
surface reconstruction for point clouds, real scans or depth maps, and further
explore the performance in unsupervised point cloud upsampling and unsupervised
point normal estimation with the learned UDF, which demonstrate our non-trivial
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are vulnerable to morph attacks. A face morph
is created by combining multiple identities with the intention to fool FRS and
making it match the morph with multiple identities. Current Morph Attack
Detection (MAD) can detect the morph but are unable to recover the identities
used to create the morph with satisfactory outcomes. Existing work in
de-morphing is mostly reference-based, i.e. they require the availability of
one identity to recover the other. Sudipta et al. \cite{ref9} proposed a
reference-free de-morphing technique but the visual realism of outputs produced
were feeble. In this work, we propose SDeMorph (Stably Diffused De-morpher), a
novel de-morphing method that is reference-free and recovers the identities of
bona fides. Our method produces feature-rich outputs that are of significantly
high quality in terms of definition and facial fidelity. Our method utilizes
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) by destroying the input morphed
signal and then reconstructing it back using a branched-UNet. Experiments on
ASML, FRLL-FaceMorph, FRLL-MorDIFF, and SMDD datasets support the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) not only improves the model robustness but
also reduces the training cost of standard adversarial training. However, fast
adversarial training often suffers from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), which
results in poor robustness performance. Catastrophic Overfitting describes the
phenomenon of a sudden and significant decrease in robust accuracy during the
training of fast adversarial training. Many effective techniques have been
developed to prevent Catastrophic Overfitting and improve the model robustness
from different perspectives. However, these techniques adopt inconsistent
training settings and require different training costs, i.e, training time and
memory costs, leading to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of over 10 fast adversarial training methods in terms of
adversarial robustness and training costs. We revisit the effectiveness and
efficiency of fast adversarial training techniques in preventing Catastrophic
Overfitting from the perspective of model local nonlinearity and propose an
effective Lipschitz regularization method for fast adversarial training.
Furthermore, we explore the effect of data augmentation and weight averaging in
fast adversarial training and propose a simple yet effective auto weight
averaging method to improve robustness further. By assembling these techniques,
we propose a FGSM-based fast adversarial training method equipped with
Lipschitz regularization and Auto Weight averaging, abbreviated as FGSM-LAW.
Experimental evaluations on four benchmark databases demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art fast adversarial
training methods and the advanced standard adversarial training methods.

Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). Unlike traditional GNC-based methods, the
proposed approach employs an adaptive shape function using B-spline to optimize
the shape of the robust kernel. This aims to reduce GNC iterations, boosting
computational speed without compromising accuracy. When integrated with the
open-source riSAM algorithm, the method demonstrates enhanced efficiency across
diverse datasets. Accompanying open-source code aims to encourage further

<p class="mathjax">The machine learning modeling process conventionally culminates in selecting
a single model that maximizes a selected performance metric. However, this
approach leads to abandoning a more profound analysis of slightly inferior
models. Particularly in medical and healthcare studies, where the objective
extends beyond predictions to valuable insight generation, relying solely on
performance metrics can result in misleading or incomplete conclusions. This
problem is particularly pertinent when dealing with a set of models with
performance close to maximum one, known as $\textit{Rashomon set}$. Such a set
can be numerous and may contain models describing the data in a different way,
which calls for comprehensive analysis. This paper introduces a novel process
to explore Rashomon set models, extending the conventional modeling approach.
The cornerstone is the identification of the most different models within the
Rashomon set, facilitated by the introduced $\texttt{Rashomon_DETECT}$
algorithm. This algorithm compares profiles illustrating prediction
dependencies on variable values generated by eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques. To quantify differences in variable effects
among models, we introduce the Profile Disparity Index (PDI) based on measures
from functional data analysis. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach,
we showcase its application in predicting survival among hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients - a foundational case study. Additionally,
we benchmark our approach on other medical data sets, demonstrating its
versatility and utility in various contexts.

<p class="mathjax">Aspect-based sentiment classification is a crucial problem in fine-grained
sentiment analysis, which aims to predict the sentiment polarity of the given
aspect according to its context. Previous works have made remarkable progress
in leveraging attention mechanism to extract opinion words for different
aspects. However, a persistent challenge is the effective management of
semantic mismatches, which stem from attention mechanisms that fall short in
adequately aligning opinions words with their corresponding aspect in
multi-aspect sentences. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Aspect-oriented Opinion Alignment Network (AOAN) to capture the contextual
association between opinion words and the corresponding aspect. Specifically,
we first introduce a neighboring span enhanced module which highlights various
compositions of neighboring words and given aspects. In addition, we design a
multi-perspective attention mechanism that align relevant opinion information
with respect to the given aspect. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results. The

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has emerged as a popular technique in
machine learning, enabling the extraction of meaningful feature representations
without labelled data. In the realm of computer vision, pretrained vision
transformers (ViTs) have played a pivotal role in advancing transfer learning.
Nonetheless, the escalating cost of finetuning these large models has posed a
challenge due to the explosion of model size. This study endeavours to evaluate
the effectiveness of pure self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques in computer
vision tasks, obviating the need for finetuning, with the intention of
emulating human-like capabilities in generalisation and recognition of unseen
objects. To this end, we propose an evaluation protocol for zero-shot
segmentation based on a prompting patch. Given a point on the target object as
a prompt, the algorithm calculates the similarity map between the selected
patch and other patches, upon that, a simple thresholding is applied to segment
the target. Another evaluation is intra-object and inter-object similarity to
gauge discriminatory ability of SSP ViTs. Insights from zero-shot segmentation
from prompting and discriminatory abilities of SSP led to the design of a
simple SSP approach, termed MMC. This approaches combines Masked image
modelling for encouraging similarity of local features, Momentum based
self-distillation for transferring semantics from global to local features, and
global Contrast for promoting semantics of global features, to enhance
discriminative representations of SSP ViTs. Consequently, our proposed method
significantly reduces the overlap of intra-object and inter-object
similarities, thereby facilitating effective object segmentation within an
image. Our experiments reveal that MMC delivers top-tier results in zero-shot
semantic segmentation across various datasets.

realistic data distribution in one step with small $W_2$ error. Our results (1)
hold for $L^2$-accurate score and consistency assumption (rather than
$L^\infty$-accurate); (2) do note require strong assumptions on the data
distribution such as log-Sobelev inequality; (3) scale polynomially in all
parameters; and (4) match the state-of-the-art convergence guarantee for
score-based generative models (SGMs). We also provide the result that the
Multistep Consistency Sampling procedure can further reduce the error comparing
to one step sampling, which support the original statement of "Consistency
Models, Yang Song 2023". Our result further imply a TV error guarantee when
take some Langevin-based modifications to the output distributions.

<p class="mathjax">Maintaining high efficiency and high precision are two fundamental challenges
in UAV tracking due to the constraints of computing resources, battery
capacity, and UAV maximum load. Discriminative correlation filters (DCF)-based
trackers can yield high efficiency on a single CPU but with inferior precision.
Lightweight Deep learning (DL)-based trackers can achieve a good balance
between efficiency and precision but performance gains are limited by the
compression rate. High compression rate often leads to poor discriminative
representations. To this end, this paper aims to enhance the discriminative
power of feature representations from a new feature-learning perspective.
Specifically, we attempt to learn more disciminative representations with
contrastive instances for UAV tracking in a simple yet effective manner, which
not only requires no manual annotations but also allows for developing and
deploying a lightweight model. We are the first to explore contrastive learning
for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments on four UAV benchmarks, including
UAV123@10fps, DTB70, UAVDT and VisDrone2018, show that the proposed DRCI
tracker significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV tracking methods.

<p class="mathjax">The demand for accurate food quantification has increased in the recent
years, driven by the needs of applications in dietary monitoring. At the same
time, computer vision approaches have exhibited great potential in automating
tasks within the food domain. Traditionally, the development of machine
learning models for these problems relies on training data sets with
pixel-level class annotations. However, this approach introduces challenges
arising from data collection and ground truth generation that quickly become
costly and error-prone since they must be performed in multiple settings and
for thousands of classes. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents a
weakly supervised methodology for training food image classification and
semantic segmentation models without relying on pixel-level annotations. The
proposed methodology is based on a multiple instance learning approach in
combination with an attention-based mechanism. At test time, the models are
used for classification and, concurrently, the attention mechanism generates
semantic heat maps which are used for food class segmentation. In the paper, we
conduct experiments on two meta-classes within the FoodSeg103 data set to
verify the feasibility of the proposed approach and we explore the functioning
properties of the attention mechanism.

<p class="mathjax">Learning meaningful representations is at the heart of many tasks in the
field of modern machine learning. Recently, a lot of methods were introduced
that allow learning of image representations without supervision. These
representations can then be used in downstream tasks like classification or
object detection. The quality of these representations is close to supervised
learning, while no labeled images are needed. This survey paper provides a
comprehensive review of these methods in a unified notation, points out
similarities and differences of these methods, and proposes a taxonomy which
sets these methods in relation to each other. Furthermore, our survey
summarizes the most-recent experimental results reported in the literature in
form of a meta-study. Our survey is intended as a starting point for
researchers and practitioners who want to dive into the field of representation
learning.

<p class="mathjax">The hearing loss of almost half a billion people is commonly treated with
hearing aids. However, current hearing aids often do not work well in
real-world noisy environments. We present a deep learning based denoising
system that runs in real time on iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S10 (25ms
algorithmic latency). The denoised audio is streamed to the hearing aid,
resulting in a total delay of around 75ms. In tests with hearing aid users
having moderate to severe hearing loss, our denoising system improves audio
across three tests: 1) listening for subjective audio ratings, 2) listening for
objective speech intelligibility, and 3) live conversations in a noisy
environment for subjective ratings. Subjective ratings increase by more than
40%, for both the listening test and the live conversation compared to a fitted
hearing aid as a baseline. Speech reception thresholds, measuring speech
understanding in noise, improve by 1.6 dB SRT. Ours is the first denoising
system that is implemented on a mobile device, streamed directly to users'
hearing aids using only a single channel as audio input while improving user
satisfaction on all tested aspects, including speech intelligibility. This
includes overall preference of the denoised and streamed signal over the
hearing aid, thereby accepting the higher latency for the significant
improvement in speech understanding.

<p class="mathjax">This paper revisits the well known single machine scheduling problem to
minimize total weighted completion times. The twist is that job sizes are
stochastic from unknown distributions, and the scheduler has access to only a
single sample from each of the distributions. For this restricted information
regime, we analyze the simplest and probably only reasonable scheduling
algorithm, namely to schedule by ordering the jobs by weight over sampled
processing times. In general, this algorithm can be tricked by adversarial
input distributions, performing in expectation arbitrarily worse even in
comparison to choosing a random schedule. The paper suggests notions to capture
the idea that this algorithm, on reasonable inputs, should exhibit a provably
good expected performance. Specifically, we identify three natural classes of
input distributions, such that for these classes, the algorithm performs better
than random on any input.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of large language models (LLMs) and their adoption by the legal
community has given rise to the question: what types of legal reasoning can
LLMs perform? To enable greater study of this question, we present LegalBench:
a collaboratively constructed legal reasoning benchmark consisting of 162 tasks
covering six different types of legal reasoning. LegalBench was built through
an interdisciplinary process, in which we collected tasks designed and
hand-crafted by legal professionals. Because these subject matter experts took
a leading role in construction, tasks either measure legal reasoning
capabilities that are practically useful, or measure reasoning skills that
lawyers find interesting. To enable cross-disciplinary conversations about LLMs
in the law, we additionally show how popular legal frameworks for describing
legal reasoning -- which distinguish between its many forms -- correspond to
LegalBench tasks, thus giving lawyers and LLM developers a common vocabulary.
This paper describes LegalBench, presents an empirical evaluation of 20
open-source and commercial LLMs, and illustrates the types of research
explorations LegalBench enables.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) inevitably confronts the challenge of system
heterogeneity in practical scenarios. To enhance the capabilities of most
model-homogeneous FL methods in handling system heterogeneity, we propose a
training scheme that can extend their capabilities to cope with this challenge.
In this paper, we commence our study with a detailed exploration of homogeneous
and heterogeneous FL settings and discover three key observations: (1) a
positive correlation between client performance and layer similarities, (2)
higher similarities in the shallow layers in contrast to the deep layers, and
(3) the smoother gradients distributions indicate the higher layer
similarities. Building upon these observations, we propose InCo Aggregation
that leverags internal cross-layer gradients, a mixture of gradients from
shallow and deep layers within a server model, to augment the similarity in the
deep layers without requiring additional communication between clients.
Furthermore, our methods can be tailored to accommodate model-homogeneous FL
methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold, and MOON, to expand their
capabilities to handle the system heterogeneity. Copious experimental results
validate the effectiveness of InCo Aggregation, spotlighting internal
cross-layer gradients as a promising avenue to enhance the performance in
heterogenous FL.

<p class="mathjax">The complex Helmholtz equation $(\Delta + k^2)u=f$ (where $k\in{\mathbb
R},u(\cdot),f(\cdot)\in{\mathbb C}$) is a mainstay of computational wave
simulation. Despite its apparent simplicity, efficient numerical methods are
challenging to design and, in some applications, regarded as an open problem.
Two sources of difficulty are the large number of degrees of freedom and the
indefiniteness of the matrices arising after discretisation. Seeking to meet
them within the novel framework of probabilistic domain decomposition, we set
out to rewrite the Helmholtz equation into a form amenable to the Feynman-Kac
formula for elliptic boundary value problems. We consider two typical
scenarios, the scattering of a plane wave and the propagation inside a cavity,
and recast them as a sequence of Poisson equations. By means of stochastic
arguments, we find a sufficient and simulatable condition for the convergence
of the iterations. Upon discretisation a necessary condition for convergence
can be derived by adding up the iterates using the harmonic series for the
matrix inverse -- we illustrate the procedure in the case of finite
differences.
<br />From a practical point of view, our results are ultimately of limited scope.
Nonetheless, this unexpected -- even paradoxical -- new direction of attack on
the Helmholtz equation proposed by this work offers a fresh perspective on this
classical and difficult problem. Our results show that there indeed exists a
predictable range $k&lt;k_{max}$ in which this new ansatz works with $k_{max}$
being far below the challenging situation.

<p class="mathjax">This work targets what we consider to be the foundational step for urban
airborne robots, a safe landing. Our attention is directed toward what we deem
the most crucial aspect of the safe landing perception stack: segmentation. We
present a streamlined reactive UAV system that employs visual servoing by
harnessing the capabilities of open vocabulary image segmentation. This
approach can adapt to various scenarios with minimal adjustments, bypassing the
necessity for extensive data accumulation for refining internal models, thanks
to its open vocabulary methodology. Given the limitations imposed by local
authorities, our primary focus centers on operations originating from altitudes
of 100 meters. This choice is deliberate, as numerous preceding works have
dealt with altitudes up to 30 meters, aligning with the capabilities of small
stereo cameras. Consequently, we leave the remaining 20m to be navigated using
conventional 3D path planning methods. Utilizing monocular cameras and image
segmentation, our findings demonstrate the system's capability to successfully
execute landing maneuvers at altitudes as low as 20 meters. However, this
approach is vulnerable to intermittent and occasionally abrupt fluctuations in
the segmentation between frames in a video stream. To address this challenge,
we enhance the image segmentation output by introducing what we call a dynamic
focus: a masking mechanism that self adjusts according to the current landing
stage. This dynamic focus guides the control system to avoid regions beyond the
drone's safety radius projected onto the ground, thus mitigating the problems
with fluctuations. Through the implementation of this supplementary layer, our
experiments have reached improvements in the landing success rate of almost
tenfold when compared to global segmentation. All the source code is open
source and available online (github.com/MISTLab/DOVESEI).

<p class="mathjax">Recent strides in Text-to-3D techniques have been propelled by distilling
knowledge from powerful large text-to-image diffusion models (LDMs).
Nonetheless, existing Text-to-3D approaches often grapple with challenges such
as over-saturation, inadequate detailing, and unrealistic outputs. This study
presents a novel strategy that leverages explicitly synthesized multi-view
images to address these issues. Our approach involves the utilization of
image-to-image pipelines, empowered by LDMs, to generate posed high-quality
images based on the renderings of coarse 3D models. Although the generated
images mostly alleviate the aforementioned issues, challenges such as view
inconsistency and significant content variance persist due to the inherent
generative nature of large diffusion models, posing extensive difficulties in
leveraging these images effectively. To overcome this hurdle, we advocate
integrating a discriminator alongside a novel Diffusion-GAN dual training
strategy to guide the training of 3D models. For the incorporated
discriminator, the synthesized multi-view images are considered real data,
while the renderings of the optimized 3D models function as fake data. We
conduct a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method over baseline approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Grounded on pre-trained language models (PLMs), dense retrieval has been
studied extensively on plain text. In contrast, there has been little research
on retrieving data with multiple aspects using dense models. In the scenarios
such as product search, the aspect information plays an essential role in
relevance matching, e.g., category: Electronics, Computers, and Pet Supplies. A
common way of leveraging aspect information for multi-aspect retrieval is to
introduce an auxiliary classification objective, i.e., using item contents to
predict the annotated value IDs of item aspects. However, by learning the value
embeddings from scratch, this approach may not capture the various semantic
similarities between the values sufficiently. To address this limitation, we
leverage the aspect information as text strings rather than class IDs during
pre-training so that their semantic similarities can be naturally captured in
the PLMs. To facilitate effective retrieval with the aspect strings, we propose
mutual prediction objectives between the text of the item aspect and content.
In this way, our model makes more sufficient use of aspect information than
conducting undifferentiated masked language modeling (MLM) on the concatenated
text of aspects and content. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
(product and mini-program search) show that our approach can outperform
competitive baselines both treating aspect values as classes and conducting the
same MLM for aspect and content strings. Code and related dataset will be
available at the URL \footnote{https://github.com/sunxiaojie99/ATTEMPT}.

<p class="mathjax">Decision trees are highly interpretable models for solving classification
problems in machine learning (ML). The standard ML algorithms for training
decision trees are fast but generate suboptimal trees in terms of accuracy.
Other discrete optimization models in the literature address the optimality
problem but only work well on relatively small datasets. \cite{firat2020column}
proposed a column-generation-based heuristic approach for learning decision
trees. This approach improves scalability and can work with large datasets. In
this paper, we describe improvements to this column generation approach. First,
we modify the subproblem model to significantly reduce the number of
subproblems in multiclass classification instances. Next, we show that the
data-dependent constraints in the master problem are implied, and use them as
cutting planes. Furthermore, we describe a separation model to generate data
points for which the linear programming relaxation solution violates their
corresponding constraints. We conclude by presenting computational results that
show that these modifications result in better scalability.

<p class="mathjax">Excavation plans are crucial in construction projects, dictating the dirt
disposal strategy and excavation sequence based on the final geometry and
machinery available. While most construction processes rely heavily on coarse
sequence planning and local execution planning driven by human expertise and
intuition, fully automated planning tools are notably absent from the industry.
This paper introduces a fully autonomous excavation planning system. Initially,
the site is mapped, followed by user selection of the desired excavation
geometry. The system then invokes a global planner to determine the sequence of
poses for the excavator, ensuring complete site coverage. For each pose, a
local excavation planner decides how to move the soil around the machine, and a
digging planner subsequently dictates the sequence of digging trajectories to
complete a patch. We showcased our system by autonomously excavating the
largest pit documented so far, achieving an average digging cycle time of
roughly 30 seconds, comparable to the one of a human operator.

<p class="mathjax">Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves
developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However,
existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are
absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution
shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in
real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous
inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts
and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each
of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking
Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these
methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent
when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only
reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to
expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model
of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present
an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution
for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to
existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is
publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various NLP tasks. However, previous works have shown these models are
sensitive towards prompt wording, and few-shot demonstrations and their order,
posing challenges to fair assessment of these models. As these models become
more powerful, it becomes imperative to understand and address these
limitations. In this paper, we focus on LLMs robustness on the task of
multiple-choice questions -- commonly adopted task to study reasoning and
fact-retrieving capability of LLMs. Investigating the sensitivity of LLMs
towards the order of options in multiple-choice questions, we demonstrate a
considerable performance gap of approximately 13% to 75% in LLMs on different
benchmarks, when answer options are reordered, even when using demonstrations
in a few-shot setting. Through a detailed analysis, we conjecture that this
sensitivity arises when LLMs are uncertain about the prediction between the
top-2/3 choices, and specific options placements may favor certain prediction
between those top choices depending on the question caused by positional bias.
We also identify patterns in top-2 choices that amplify or mitigate the model's
bias toward option placement. We found that for amplifying bias, the optimal
strategy involves positioning the top two choices as the first and last
options. Conversely, to mitigate bias, we recommend placing these choices among
the adjacent options. To validate our conjecture, we conduct various
experiments and adopt two approaches to calibrate LLMs' predictions, leading to
up to 8 percentage points improvement across different models and benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Video-based ambient monitoring of gait for older adults with dementia has the
potential to detect negative changes in health and allow clinicians and
caregivers to intervene early to prevent falls or hospitalizations. Computer
vision-based pose tracking models can process video data automatically and
extract joint locations; however, publicly available models are not optimized
for gait analysis on older adults or clinical populations. In this work we
train a deep neural network to map from a two dimensional pose sequence,
extracted from a video of an individual walking down a hallway toward a
wall-mounted camera, to a set of three-dimensional spatiotemporal gait features
averaged over the walking sequence. The data of individuals with dementia used
in this work was captured at two sites using a wall-mounted system to collect
the video and depth information used to train and evaluate our model. Our
Pose2Gait model is able to extract velocity and step length values from the
video that are correlated with the features from the depth camera, with
Spearman's correlation coefficients of .83 and .60 respectively, showing that
three dimensional spatiotemporal features can be predicted from monocular
video. Future work remains to improve the accuracy of other features, such as
step time and step width, and test the utility of the predicted values for
detecting meaningful changes in gait during longitudinal ambient monitoring.

<p class="mathjax">Given a query composed of a reference image and a relative caption, the
Composed Image Retrieval goal is to retrieve images visually similar to the
reference one that integrates the modifications expressed by the caption. Given
that recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of large-scale vision and
language pre-trained (VLP) models in various tasks, we rely on features from
the OpenAI CLIP model to tackle the considered task. We initially perform a
task-oriented fine-tuning of both CLIP encoders using the element-wise sum of
visual and textual features. Then, in the second stage, we train a Combiner
network that learns to combine the image-text features integrating the bimodal
information and providing combined features used to perform the retrieval. We
use contrastive learning in both stages of training. Starting from the bare
CLIP features as a baseline, experimental results show that the task-oriented
fine-tuning and the carefully crafted Combiner network are highly effective and
outperform more complex state-of-the-art approaches on FashionIQ and CIRR, two
popular and challenging datasets for composed image retrieval. Code and

<p class="mathjax">Gait recognition is to seek correct matches for query individuals by their
unique walking patterns at a long distance. However, current methods focus
solely on individual gait features, disregarding inter-personal relationships.
In this paper, we reconsider gait representation, asserting that gait is not
just an aggregation of individual features, but also the relationships among
different subjects' gait features once reference gaits are established. From
this perspective, we redefine classifier weights as reference-anchored gaits,
allowing each person's gait to be described by their relationship with these
references. In our work, we call this novel descriptor Relationship Descriptor
(RD). This Relationship Descriptor offers two benefits: emphasizing meaningful
features and enhancing robustness. To be specific, The normalized dot product
between gait features and classifier weights signifies a similarity relation,
where each dimension indicates the similarity between the test sample and each
training ID's gait prototype, respectively. Despite its potential, the direct
use of relationship descriptors poses dimensionality challenges since the
dimension of RD depends on the training set's identity count. To address this,
we propose a Farthest Anchored gaits Selection algorithm and a dimension
reduction method to boost gait recognition performance. Our method can be built
on top of off-the-shelf pre-trained classification-based models without extra
parameters. We show that RD achieves higher recognition performance than
directly using extracted features. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method
on the popular GREW, Gait3D, CASIA-B, and OU-MVLP, showing that our method
consistently outperforms the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art
performances.

<p class="mathjax">Human actions in egocentric videos are often hand-object interactions
composed from a verb (performed by the hand) applied to an object. Despite
their extensive scaling up, egocentric datasets still face two limitations -
sparsity of action compositions and a closed set of interacting objects. This
paper proposes a novel open vocabulary action recognition task. Given a set of
verbs and objects observed during training, the goal is to generalize the verbs
to an open vocabulary of actions with seen and novel objects. To this end, we
decouple the verb and object predictions via an object-agnostic verb encoder
and a prompt-based object encoder. The prompting leverages CLIP representations
to predict an open vocabulary of interacting objects. We create open vocabulary
benchmarks on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and Assembly101 datasets; whereas
closed-action methods fail to generalize, our proposed method is effective. In
addition, our object encoder significantly outperforms existing open-vocabulary
visual recognition methods in recognizing novel interacting objects.

<p class="mathjax">We are concerned with a challenging scenario in unpaired multiview video
learning. In this case, the model aims to learn comprehensive multiview
representations while the cross-view semantic information exhibits variations.
We propose Semantics-based Unpaired Multiview Learning (SUM-L) to tackle this
unpaired multiview learning problem. The key idea is to build cross-view
pseudo-pairs and do view-invariant alignment by leveraging the semantic
information of videos. To facilitate the data efficiency of multiview learning,
we further perform video-text alignment for first-person and third-person
videos, to fully leverage the semantic knowledge to improve video
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify
the effectiveness of our framework. Our method also outperforms multiple
existing view-alignment methods, under the more challenging scenario than
typical paired or unpaired multimodal or multiview learning. Our code is

<p class="mathjax">Automatically disentangling an author's style from the content of their
writing is a longstanding and possibly insurmountable problem in computational
linguistics. At the same time, the availability of large text corpora furnished
with author labels has recently enabled learning authorship representations in
a purely data-driven manner for authorship attribution, a task that ostensibly
depends to a greater extent on encoding writing style than encoding content.
However, success on this surrogate task does not ensure that such
representations capture writing style since authorship could also be correlated
with other latent variables, such as topic. In an effort to better understand
the nature of the information these representations convey, and specifically to
validate the hypothesis that they chiefly encode writing style, we
systematically probe these representations through a series of targeted
experiments. The results of these experiments suggest that representations
learned for the surrogate authorship prediction task are indeed sensitive to
writing style. As a consequence, authorship representations may be expected to
be robust to certain kinds of data shift, such as topic drift over time.
Additionally, our findings may open the door to downstream applications that
require stylistic representations, such as style transfer.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal sensor integration has become a crucial prerequisite for the
real-world navigation systems. Recent studies have reported successful
deployment of such system in many fields. However, it is still challenging for
navigation tasks in mine scenes due to satellite signal dropouts, degraded
perception, and observation degeneracy. To solve this problem, we propose a
LiDAR-inertial odometry method in this paper, utilizing both Kalman filter and
graph optimization. The front-end consists of multiple parallel running
LiDAR-inertial odometries, where the laser points, IMU, and wheel odometer
information are tightly fused in an error-state Kalman filter. Instead of the
commonly used feature points, we employ surface elements for registration. The
back-end construct a pose graph and jointly optimize the pose estimation
results from inertial, LiDAR odometry, and global navigation satellite system
(GNSS). Since the vehicle has a long operation time inside the tunnel, the
largely accumulated drift may be not fully by the GNSS measurements. We hereby
leverage a loop closure based re-initialization process to achieve full
alignment. In addition, the system robustness is improved through handling data
loss, stream consistency, and estimation error. The experimental results show
that our system has a good tolerance to the long-period degeneracy with the
cooperation different LiDARs and surfel registration, achieving meter-level
accuracy even for tens of minutes running during GNSS dropouts.

<p class="mathjax">Precise, seamless, and efficient train localization as well as long-term
railway environment monitoring is the essential property towards reliability,
availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS) engineering for railroad
systems. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is right at the core of
solving the two problems concurrently. In this end, we propose a
high-performance and versatile multi-modal framework in this paper, targeted
for the odometry and mapping task for various rail vehicles. Our system is
built atop an inertial-centric state estimator that tightly couples light
detection and ranging (LiDAR), visual, optionally satellite navigation and
map-based localization information with the convenience and extendibility of
loosely coupled methods. The inertial sensors IMU and wheel encoder are treated
as the primary sensor, which achieves the observations from subsystems to
constrain the accelerometer and gyroscope biases. Compared to point-only
LiDAR-inertial methods, our approach leverages more geometry information by
introducing both track plane and electric power pillars into state estimation.
The Visual-inertial subsystem also utilizes the environmental structure
information by employing both lines and points. Besides, the method is capable
of handling sensor failures by automatic reconfiguration bypassing failure
modules. Our proposed method has been extensively tested in the long-during
railway environments over four years, including general-speed, high-speed and
metro, both passenger and freight traffic are investigated. Further, we aim to
share, in an open way, the experience, problems, and successes of our group
with the robotics community so that those that work in such environments can
avoid these errors. In this view, we open source some of the datasets to
benefit the research community.

<p class="mathjax">The solution to partial differential equations using deep learning approaches
has shown promising results for several classes of initial and boundary-value
problems. However, their ability to surpass, particularly in terms of accuracy,
classical discretization methods such as the finite element methods, remains a
significant challenge. Deep learning methods usually struggle to reliably
decrease the error in their approximate solution. A new methodology to better
control the error for deep learning methods is presented here. The main idea
consists in computing an initial approximation to the problem using a simple
neural network and in estimating, in an iterative manner, a correction by
solving the problem for the residual error with a new network of increasing
complexity. This sequential reduction of the residual of the partial
differential equation allows one to decrease the solution error, which, in some
cases, can be reduced to machine precision. The underlying explanation is that
the method is able to capture at each level smaller scales of the solution
using a new network. Numerical examples in 1D and 2D are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach applies
not only to physics informed neural networks but to other neural network
solvers based on weak or strong formulations of the residual.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies co-segmenting the common semantic object in a set of
images. Existing works either rely on carefully engineered networks to mine the
implicit semantic information in visual features or require extra data (i.e.,
classification labels) for training. In this paper, we leverage the contrastive
language-image pre-training framework (CLIP) for the task. With a backbone
segmentation network that independently processes each image from the set, we
introduce semantics from CLIP into the backbone features, refining them in a
coarse-to-fine manner with three key modules: i) an image set feature
correspondence module, encoding global consistent semantic information of the
image set; ii) a CLIP interaction module, using CLIP-mined common semantics of
the image set to refine the backbone feature; iii) a CLIP regularization
module, drawing CLIP towards this co-segmentation task, identifying the best
CLIP semantic and using it to regularize the backbone feature. Experiments on
four standard co-segmentation benchmark datasets show that the performance of
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP and
ALIGN) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in acquiring transferable
visual representations. To leverage the valuable knowledge encoded within these
models for downstream tasks, several fine-tuning approaches, including prompt
tuning methods and adapter-based methods, have been developed to adapt
vision-language models effectively with supervision. However, these methods
rely on the availability of annotated samples, which can be labor-intensive and
time-consuming to acquire, thus limiting scalability. To address this issue, in
this work, we design an unsupervised fine-tuning approach for vision-language
models called Unsupervised Prototype Adapter (UP-Adapter). Specifically, for
the unannotated target datasets, we leverage the text-image aligning capability
of CLIP to automatically select the most confident samples for each class.
Utilizing these selected samples, we generate class prototypes, which serve as
the initialization for the learnable prototype model. After fine-tuning, the
prototype model prediction is combined with the original CLIP's prediction by a
residual connection to perform downstream recognition tasks. Our extensive
experimental results on image recognition and domain generalization show that
the proposed unsupervised method outperforms 8-shot CoOp, 8-shot Tip-Adapter,
and also the state-of-the-art UPL method by large margins.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, vision transformers have been introduced into face
recognition and analysis and have achieved performance breakthroughs. However,
most previous methods generally train a single model or an ensemble of models
to perform the desired task, which ignores the synergy among different tasks
and fails to achieve improved prediction accuracy, increased data efficiency,
and reduced training time. This paper presents a multi-purpose algorithm for
simultaneous face recognition, facial expression recognition, age estimation,
and face attribute estimation (40 attributes including gender) based on a
single Swin Transformer. Our design, the SwinFace, consists of a single shared
backbone together with a subnet for each set of related tasks. To address the
conflicts among multiple tasks and meet the different demands of tasks, a
Multi-Level Channel Attention (MLCA) module is integrated into each
task-specific analysis subnet, which can adaptively select the features from
optimal levels and channels to perform the desired tasks. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed model has a better understanding of the face and
achieves excellent performance for all tasks. Especially, it achieves 90.97%
accuracy on RAF-DB and 0.22 $\epsilon$-error on CLAP2015, which are
state-of-the-art results on facial expression recognition and age estimation
respectively. The code and models will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/lxq1000/SwinFace.

even with significant perturbations of the neuron matchings the resulting

data sets, ignoring that in the real-world, the data on the Web is continuously
growing with potential distribution drift. Consequently, retrievers trained on
static old data may not suit new-coming data well and inevitably produce
sub-optimal results. In this work, we study lifelong learning for first-stage
retrieval, especially focusing on the setting where the emerging documents are
unlabeled since relevance annotation is expensive and may not keep up with data
emergence. Under this setting, we aim to develop model updating with two goals:
(1) to effectively adapt to the evolving distribution with the unlabeled
new-coming data, and (2) to avoid re-inferring all embeddings of old documents
to efficiently update the index each time the model is updated.
<br />We first formalize the task and then propose a novel Lifelong Learning method
for the first-stage Retrieval, namely L^2R. L^2R adopts the typical memory
mechanism for lifelong learning, and incorporates two crucial components: (1)
selecting diverse support negatives for model training and memory updating for
effective model adaptation, and (2) a ranking alignment objective to ensure the
backward-compatibility of representations to save the cost of index rebuilding
without hurting the model performance. For evaluation, we construct two new
benchmarks from LoTTE and Multi-CPR datasets to simulate the document
distribution drift in realistic retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that L^2R significantly outperforms competitive lifelong learning baselines.

<p class="mathjax">The field of multi-object tracking has recently seen a renewed interest in
the good old schema of tracking-by-detection, as its simplicity and strong
priors spare it from the complex design and painful babysitting of
tracking-by-attention approaches. In view of this, we aim at extending
tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has
to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual
appearance, and pose estimates. More precisely, we follow a case study where a
rough estimate of 3D information is also available and must be merged with
other traditional metrics (e.g., the IoU). To achieve that, recent approaches
resort to either simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution
of each cost. However, i) they require careful tuning of tailored
hyperparameters on a hold-out set, and ii) they imply these costs to be
independent, which does not hold in reality. We address these issues by
building upon an elegant probabilistic formulation, which considers the cost of
a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood yielded by a deep
density estimator, trained to model the conditional joint probability
distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on both
simulated and real benchmarks, show that our approach consistently enhances the
performance of several tracking-by-detection algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Modern data-driven and distributed learning frameworks deal with diverse
massive data generated by clients spread across heterogeneous environments.
Indeed, data heterogeneity is a major bottleneck in scaling up many distributed
learning paradigms. In many settings however, heterogeneous data may be
generated in clusters with shared structures, as is the case in several
applications such as federated learning where a common latent variable governs
the distribution of all the samples generated by a client. It is therefore
natural to ask how the underlying clustered structures in distributed data can
be exploited to improve learning schemes. In this paper, we tackle this
question in the special case of estimating $d$-dimensional parameters of a
two-component mixture of linear regressions problem where each of $m$ nodes
generates $n$ samples with a shared latent variable. We employ the well-known
Expectation-Maximization (EM) method to estimate the maximum likelihood
parameters from $m$ batches of dependent samples each containing $n$
measurements. Discarding the clustered structure in the mixture model, EM is
known to require $O(\log(mn/d))$ iterations to reach the statistical accuracy
of $O(\sqrt{d/(mn)})$. In contrast, we show that if initialized properly, EM on
the structured data requires only $O(1)$ iterations to reach the same
statistical accuracy, as long as $m$ grows up as $e^{o(n)}$. Our analysis
establishes and combines novel asymptotic optimization and generalization
guarantees for population and empirical EM with dependent samples, which may be
of independent interest.

<p class="mathjax">Customer reviews play a crucial role in assessing customer satisfaction,
gathering feedback, and driving improvements for businesses. Analyzing these
reviews provides valuable insights into customer sentiments, including
compliments, comments, and suggestions. Text classification techniques enable
businesses to categorize customer reviews into distinct categories,
facilitating a better understanding of customer feedback. However, challenges
such as overfitting and bias limit the effectiveness of a single classifier in
ensuring optimal prediction. This study proposes a novel approach to address
these challenges by introducing a stacking ensemble-based multi-text
classification method that leverages transformer models. By combining multiple
single transformers, including BERT, ELECTRA, and DistilBERT, as base-level
classifiers, and a meta-level classifier based on RoBERTa, an optimal
predictive model is generated. The proposed stacking ensemble-based multi-text
classification method aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of customer
review analysis. Experimental evaluations conducted on a real-world customer
review dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
approach over traditional single classifier models. The stacking ensemble-based
multi-text classification method using transformers proves to be a promising
solution for businesses seeking to extract valuable insights from customer
reviews and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and
drive continuous improvement.

<p class="mathjax">The exponential growth of online social network platforms and applications
has led to a staggering volume of user-generated textual content, including
comments and reviews. Consequently, users often face difficulties in extracting
valuable insights or relevant information from such content. To address this
challenge, machine learning and natural language processing algorithms have
been deployed to analyze the vast amount of textual data available online. In
recent years, topic modeling techniques have gained significant popularity in
this domain. In this study, we comprehensively examine and compare five
frequently used topic modeling methods specifically applied to customer
reviews. The methods under investigation are latent semantic analysis (LSA),
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF),
pachinko allocation model (PAM), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. By practically
demonstrating their benefits in detecting important topics, we aim to highlight
their efficacy in real-world scenarios. To evaluate the performance of these
topic modeling methods, we carefully select two textual datasets. The
evaluation is based on standard statistical evaluation metrics such as topic
coherence score. Our findings reveal that BERTopic consistently yield more
meaningful extracted topics and achieve favorable results.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have emerged with astonishing
capabilities approaching artificial general intelligence. While providing
convenience for various societal needs, LLMs have also lowered the cost of
generating harmful content. Consequently, LLM developers have deployed
semantic-level defenses to recognize and reject prompts that may lead to
inappropriate content. Unfortunately, these defenses are not foolproof, and
some attackers have crafted "jailbreak" prompts that temporarily hypnotize the
LLM into forgetting content defense rules and answering any improper questions.
To date, there is no clear explanation of the principles behind these
semantic-level attacks and defenses in both industry and academia.
<br />This paper investigates the LLM jailbreak problem and proposes an automatic
jailbreak method for the first time. We propose the concept of a semantic
firewall and provide three technical implementation approaches. Inspired by the
attack that penetrates traditional firewalls through reverse tunnels, we
introduce a "self-deception" attack that can bypass the semantic firewall by
inducing LLM to generate prompts that facilitate jailbreak. We generated a
total of 2,520 attack payloads in six languages (English, Russian, French,
Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic) across seven virtual scenarios, targeting the
three most common types of violations: violence, hate, and pornography. The
experiment was conducted on two models, namely the GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. The
success rates on the two models were 86.2% and 67%, while the failure rates
were 4.7% and 2.2%, respectively. This highlighted the effectiveness of the
proposed attack method. All experimental code and raw data will be released as
open-source to inspire future research. We believe that manipulating AI
behavior through carefully crafted prompts will become an important research
direction in the future.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to optimize the design of
Reservoir Computing using Cellular Automata models for time series
applications. Besides selecting the models' hyperparameters, the proposed
algorithm particularly solves the open problem of linear Cellular Automaton
rule selection. The selection method pre-selects only a few promising candidate
rules out of an exponentially growing rule space. When applied to relevant
benchmark datasets, the selected rules achieve low errors, with the best rules
being among the top 5% of the overall rule space. The algorithm was developed
based on mathematical analysis of linear Cellular Automaton properties and is
backed by almost one million experiments, adding up to a computational runtime
of nearly one year. Comparisons to other state-of-the-art time series models
show that the proposed Reservoir Computing using Cellular Automata models have
lower computational complexity, at the same time, achieve lower errors. Hence,
our approach reduces the time needed for training and hyperparameter
optimization by up to several orders of magnitude.

<p class="mathjax">AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is a powerful platform that Site Reliability
Engineers (SREs) use to automate and streamline operational workflows with
minimal human intervention. Automated log analysis is a critical task in AIOps
as it provides key insights for SREs to identify and address ongoing faults.
Tasks such as log format detection, log classification, and log parsing are key
components of automated log analysis. Most of these tasks require supervised
learning; however, there are multiple challenges due to limited labelled log
data and the diverse nature of log data. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
BERT and GPT3 are trained using self-supervision on a vast amount of unlabeled
data. These models provide generalized representations that can be effectively
used for various downstream tasks with limited labelled data. Motivated by the
success of LLMs in specific domains like science and biology, this paper
introduces a LLM for log data which is trained on public and proprietary log
data. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLM
outperforms existing models on multiple downstream tasks. In summary, AIOps
powered by LLMs offers an efficient and effective solution for automating log
analysis tasks and enabling SREs to focus on higher-level tasks. Our proposed
LLM, trained on public and proprietary log data, offers superior performance on
multiple downstream tasks, making it a valuable addition to the AIOps platform.

<p class="mathjax">Although deep pre-trained language models have shown promising benefit in a
large set of industrial scenarios, including Click-Through-Rate (CTR)
prediction, how to integrate pre-trained language models that handle only
textual signals into a prediction pipeline with non-textual features is
challenging.
<br />Up to now two directions have been explored to integrate multi-modal inputs
in fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. One consists of fusing the
outcome of language models and non-textual features through an aggregation
layer, resulting into ensemble framework, where the cross-information between
textual and non-textual inputs are only learned in the aggregation layer. The
second one consists of splitting non-textual features into fine-grained
fragments and transforming the fragments to new tokens combined with textual
ones, so that they can be fed directly to transformer layers in language
models. However, this approach increases the complexity of the learning and
inference because of the numerous additional tokens.
<br />To address these limitations, we propose in this work a novel framework
BERT4CTR, with the Uni-Attention mechanism that can benefit from the
interactions between non-textual and textual features while maintaining low
time-costs in training and inference through a dimensionality reduction.
Comprehensive experiments on both public and commercial data demonstrate that
BERT4CTR can outperform significantly the state-of-the-art frameworks to handle
multi-modal inputs and be applicable to CTR prediction.

<p class="mathjax">American democracy is currently heavily reliant on plurality in single-member
districts, or PSMD, as a system of election. But public perceptions of fairness
are often keyed to partisan proportionality, or the degree of congruence
between each party's share of the the vote and its share of representation.
PSMD has not tended to secure proportional outcomes historically, partially due
to gerrymandering, where line-drawers intentionally extract more advantage for
their side. But it is now increasingly clear that even blind PSMD is frequently
disproportional, and in unpredictable ways that depend on local political
geography. In this paper we consider whether it is feasible to bring PSMD into
alignment with a proportionality norm by targeting proportional outcomes in the
design and selection of districts. We do this mainly through a close
examination of the "Freedom to Vote Test," a redistricting reform proposed in
draft legislation in 2021. We find that applying the test with a
proportionality target makes for sound policy: it performs well in legal
battleground states and has a workable exception to handle edge cases where
proportionality is out of reach.

that align the corresponding representations of the text and audio, and a
decoupled language decoder that generates temporal and event sequences from the
audio characteristic. Compared with conventional works that require complicated
processing and barely utilize limited audio features, our model is more concise
and comprehensive since language model directly leverage its semantic
capabilities to generate the sequences. We investigate different decoupling
modules to demonstrate the effectiveness for timestamps capture and event
classification. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves
accurate sequences of sound event detection.

adjudications, such as lawyers, judges, governing bodies, and claimants, in
order to make better decisions through data-driven intelligence and increase
the understanding and transparency of the refugee application process for all
involved parties. This PhD project has two primary objectives: (1) to retrieve
past cases, and (2) to analyze legal decision-making processes on a dataset of
Canadian cases. In this paper, we present the current state of our work, which
includes a completed experiment on part (1) and ongoing efforts related to part
(2). We believe that NLP-based solutions are well-suited to address these
challenges, and we investigate the feasibility of automating all steps
involved. In addition, we introduce a novel benchmark for future NLP research
in refugee law. Our methodology aims to be inclusive to all end-users and
stakeholders, with expected benefits including reduced time-to-decision, fairer
and more transparent outcomes, and improved decision quality.

<p class="mathjax">In this article an innovative method for training regressive MLP networks is
presented, which is not subject to local minima. The Error-Back-Propagation
algorithm, proposed by William-Hinton-Rummelhart, has had the merit of
favouring the development of machine learning techniques, which has permeated
every branch of research and technology since the mid-1980s. This extraordinary
success is largely due to the black-box approach, but this same factor was also
seen as a limitation, as soon more challenging problems were approached. One of
the most critical aspects of the training algorithms was that of local minima
of the loss function, typically the mean squared error of the output on the
training set. In fact, as the most popular training algorithms are driven by
the derivatives of the loss function, there is no possibility to evaluate if a
reached minimum is local or global. The algorithm presented in this paper
avoids the problem of local minima, as the training is based on the properties
of the distribution of the training set, or better on its image internal to the
neural network. The performance of the algorithm is shown for a well-known
benchmark.

admit a good low rank approximation. It is known that this can be achieved when

this normality condition, using the idea of operator dilations. The basic
problem then becomes the lifting of Sylvester equations, which is reminiscent
of the classical commutant lifting theorem and its variations. Our approach
also allows us to show that the (factored) alternating direction implicit

<p class="mathjax">The unparalleled performance of closed-sourced ChatGPT has sparked efforts
towards its democratization, with notable strides made by leveraging real user
and ChatGPT conversations, as evidenced by Vicuna. However, while current
endeavors like Baize and UltraChat aim to auto-generate conversational data due
to challenges in gathering human participation, they primarily rely on ChatGPT
to simulate human behaviors based on directives rather than genuine human
learning. This results in a limited scope, diminished diversity, and an absence
of genuine multi-round conversational dynamics. To address the above issues, we
innovatively target human questions extracted from genuine human-machine
conversations as a learning goal and train a user simulator, UserGPT, to
produce a high-quality human-centric synthetic conversation dataset, RealChat.
Subsequently, this dataset trains our assistant model, ReaLM. Experimentally,
ReaLM outpaces baseline models in both Vicuna-Bench and MT-Bench by pairwise
comparison when considering equivalent training set sizes, and manual
evaluation also shows that our model is highly competitive. Impressively, when
fine-tuned with the latest LLaMA 2 model, ReaLM secured a leading score of 6.33
in the MT-Bench, outshining the contemporary same-scale models, including the
LLaMA-2-7B-chat model. Further in-depth analysis demonstrates the scalability
and transferability of our approach. A preliminary exploration into the
interplay between training set data quality and resultant model performance is
also undertaken, laying a robust groundwork for future investigations.

<p class="mathjax">Biomedical entity linking (BEL) is the task of grounding entity mentions to a
knowledge base. It plays a vital role in information extraction pipelines for
the life sciences literature. We review recent work in the field and find that,
as the task is absent from existing benchmarks for biomedical text mining,
different studies adopt different experimental setups making comparisons based
on published numbers problematic. Furthermore, neural systems are tested
primarily on instances linked to the broad coverage knowledge base UMLS,
leaving their performance to more specialized ones, e.g. genes or variants,
understudied. We therefore developed BELB, a Biomedical Entity Linking
Benchmark, providing access in a unified format to 11 corpora linked to 7
knowledge bases and spanning six entity types: gene, disease, chemical,
species, cell line and variant. BELB greatly reduces preprocessing overhead in
testing BEL systems on multiple corpora offering a standardized testbed for
reproducible experiments. Using BELB we perform an extensive evaluation of six
rule-based entity-specific systems and three recent neural approaches
leveraging pre-trained language models. Our results reveal a mixed picture
showing that neural approaches fail to perform consistently across entity
types, highlighting the need of further studies towards entity-agnostic models.

<p class="mathjax">Previous research on refugee status adjudications has shown that prediction
of the outcome of an application can be derived from very few features with
satisfactory accuracy. Recent research work has achieved between 70 and 90%
accuracy using text analytics on various legal fields among which refugee
status determination. Some studies report predictions derived from the judge
identity only. Additionally most features used for prediction are
non-substantive and external features ranging from news reports, date and time
of the hearing or weather. On the other hand, literature shows that noise is
ubiquitous in human judgments and significantly affects the outcome of
decisions. It has been demonstrated that noise is a significant factor
impacting legal decisions. We use the term "noise" in the sense described by D.
Kahneman, as a measure of how human beings are unavoidably influenced by
external factors when making a decision. In the context of refugee status
determination, it means for instance that two judges would take different
decisions when presented with the same application. This article explores ways
that machine learning can help reduce noise in refugee law decision making. We
are not suggesting that this proposed methodology should be exclusive from
other approaches to improve decisions such as training of decision makers,
skills acquisition or judgment aggregation, but rather that it is a path worth
exploring. We investigate how artificial intelligence and specifically
data-driven applications can be used to benefit all parties involved in refugee
status adjudications. We specifically look at decisions taken in Canada and in
the United States. Our research aims at reducing arbitrariness and unfairness
that derive from noisy decisions, based on the assumption that if two cases or
applications are alike they should be treated in the same way and induce the
same outcome.

<p class="mathjax">Video-Text Retrieval (VTR) is a crucial multi-modal task in an era of massive
video-text data on the Internet. A plethora of work characterized by using a
two-stream Vision-Language model architecture that learns a joint
representation of video-text pairs has become a prominent approach for the VTR
task. However, these models operate under the assumption of bijective
video-text correspondences and neglect a more practical scenario where video
content usually encompasses multiple events, while texts like user queries or
webpage metadata tend to be specific and correspond to single events. This
establishes a gap between the previous training objective and real-world
applications, leading to the potential performance degradation of earlier
models during inference. In this study, we introduce the Multi-event Video-Text
Retrieval (MeVTR) task, addressing scenarios in which each video contains
multiple different events, as a niche scenario of the conventional Video-Text
Retrieval Task. We present a simple model, Me-Retriever, which incorporates key
event video representation and a new MeVTR loss for the MeVTR task.
Comprehensive experiments show that this straightforward framework outperforms
other models in the Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks, effectively
establishing a robust baseline for the MeVTR task. We believe this work serves
as a strong foundation for future studies. Code is available at
https://github.com/gengyuanmax/MeVTR.

<p class="mathjax">We study the equivalence testing problem where the goal is to determine if
the given two unknown distributions on $[n]$ are equal or $\epsilon$-far in the
total variation distance in the conditional sampling model (CFGM, SICOMP16;
CRS, SICOMP15) wherein a tester can get a sample from the distribution
conditioned on any subset. Equivalence testing is a central problem in
distribution testing, and there has been a plethora of work on this topic in
various sampling models.
<br />Despite significant efforts over the years, there remains a gap in the
current best-known upper bound of $\tilde{O}(\log \log n)$ [FJOPS, COLT 2015]
and lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log \log n})$[ACK, RANDOM 2015, Theory of
Computing 2018].
<br />Closing this gap has been repeatedly posed as an open problem (listed as
problems 66 and 87 at sublinear.info). In this paper, we completely resolve the
query complexity of this problem by showing a lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(\log \log n)$. For that purpose, we develop a novel and generic
proof technique that enables us to break the $\sqrt{\log \log n}$ barrier, not
only for the equivalence testing problem but also for other distribution
testing problems, such as uniblock property.

graph-aware transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependency, which is
beneficial for navigation state tracking and robust action planning. TG-GAT
first leverages a graph-aware transformer to capture spatiotemporal

grounding task is devised to boost the agent's awareness of referred landmarks.
Moreover, a hybrid augmentation strategy based on large language models is
utilized to mitigate data scarcity limitations. Our TG-GAT framework won the

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies show that self-attentions behave like low-pass filters (as
opposed to convolutions) and enhancing their high-pass filtering capability
improves model performance. Contrary to this idea, we investigate existing
convolution-based models with spectral analysis and observe that improving the
low-pass filtering in convolution operations also leads to performance
improvement. To account for this observation, we hypothesize that utilizing
optimal token mixers that capture balanced representations of both high- and
low-frequency components can enhance the performance of models. We verify this
by decomposing visual features into the frequency domain and combining them in
a balanced manner. To handle this, we replace the balancing problem with a mask
filtering problem in the frequency domain. Then, we introduce a novel
token-mixer named SPAM and leverage it to derive a MetaFormer model termed as
SPANet. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a way to
achieve this balance, and the balanced representations of both high- and
low-frequency components can improve the performance of models on multiple
computer vision tasks. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">This study introduces a novel framework, G3Reg, for fast and robust global
registration of LiDAR point clouds. In contrast to conventional complex
keypoints and descriptors, we extract fundamental geometric primitives
including planes, clusters, and lines (PCL) from the raw point cloud to obtain
low-level semantic segments. Each segment is formulated as a unified Gaussian
Ellipsoid Model (GEM) by employing a probability ellipsoid to ensure the ground
truth centers are encompassed with a certain degree of probability. Utilizing
these GEMs, we then present a distrust-and-verify scheme based on a Pyramid
Compatibility Graph for Global Registration (PAGOR). Specifically, we establish
an upper bound, which can be traversed based on the confidence level for
compatibility testing to construct the pyramid graph. Gradually, we solve
multiple maximum cliques (MAC) for each level of the graph, generating numerous
transformation candidates. In the verification phase, we adopt a precise and
efficient metric for point cloud alignment quality, founded on geometric
primitives, to identify the optimal candidate. The performance of the algorithm
is extensively validated on three publicly available datasets and a
self-collected multi-session dataset, without changing any parameter settings
in the experimental evaluation. The results exhibit superior robustness and
real-time performance of the G3Reg framework compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential for integrating individual
GEM and PAGOR components into other algorithmic frameworks to enhance their
efficacy. To advance further research and promote community understanding, we
have publicly shared the source code.

<p class="mathjax">After the inception of emotion recognition or affective computing, it has
increasingly become an active research topic due to its broad applications.
Over the past couple of decades, emotion recognition models have gradually
migrated from statistically shallow models to neural network-based deep models,
which can significantly boost the performance of emotion recognition models and
consistently achieve the best results on different benchmarks. Therefore, in
recent years, deep models have always been considered the first option for
emotion recognition. However, the debut of large language models (LLMs), such
as ChatGPT, has remarkably astonished the world due to their emerged
capabilities of zero/few-shot learning, in-context learning, chain-of-thought,
and others that are never shown in previous deep models. In the present paper,
we comprehensively investigate how the LLMs perform in emotion recognition in
terms of diverse aspects, including in-context learning, few-short learning,
accuracy, generalisation, and explanation. Moreover, we offer some insights and
pose other potential challenges, hoping to ignite broader discussions about
enhancing emotion recognition in the new era of advanced and generalised large
models.

<p class="mathjax">Support vector machine (SVM), is a popular kernel method for data
classification that demonstrated its efficiency for a large range of practical
applications. The method suffers, however, from some weaknesses including; time
processing, risk of failure of the optimization process for high dimension
cases, generalization to multi-classes, unbalanced classes, and dynamic
classification. In this paper an alternative method is proposed having a
similar performance, with a sensitive improvement of the aforementioned
shortcomings. The new method is based on a minimum distance to optimal

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we set the mathematical foundations of the Dynamical Low Rank
Approximation (DLRA) method for high-dimensional stochastic differential
equations. DLRA aims at approximating the solution as a linear combination of a
small number of basis vectors with random coefficients (low rank format) with
the peculiarity that both the basis vectors and the random coefficients vary in
time. While the formulation and properties of DLRA are now well understood for
random/parametric equations, the same cannot be said for SDEs and this work
aims to fill this gap. We start by rigorously formulating a Dynamically
Orthogonal (DO) approximation (an instance of DLRA successfully used in
applications) for SDEs, which we then generalize to define a parametrization
independent DLRA for SDEs. We show local well-posedness of the DO equations and
their equivalence with the DLRA formulation. We also characterize the explosion
time of the DO solution by a loss of linear independence of the random
coefficients defining the solution expansion and give sufficient conditions for
global existence.

<p class="mathjax">The integration of emotional support into various conversational scenarios
presents profound societal benefits, such as social interactions, mental health
counseling, and customer service. However, there are unsolved challenges that
hinder real-world applications in this field, including limited data
availability and the absence of well-accepted model training paradigms. This
work endeavors to navigate these challenges by harnessing the capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an innovative methodology that
synthesizes human insights with the computational prowess of LLMs to curate an
extensive emotional support dialogue dataset. Our approach is initiated with a
meticulously designed set of dialogues spanning diverse scenarios as generative
seeds. By utilizing the in-context learning potential of ChatGPT, we
recursively generate an ExTensible Emotional Support dialogue dataset, named
ExTES. Following this, we deploy advanced tuning techniques on the LLaMA model,
examining the impact of diverse training strategies, ultimately yielding an LLM
meticulously optimized for emotional support interactions. An exhaustive
assessment of the resultant model showcases its proficiency in offering
emotional support, marking a pivotal step in the realm of emotional support
bots and paving the way for subsequent research and implementations.

<p class="mathjax">In the wake of the explosive growth of machine learning (ML) usage,
particularly within the context of emerging Large Language Models (LLMs),
comprehending the semantic significance rooted in their internal workings is
crucial. While causal analyses focus on defining semantics and its
quantification, the gradient-based approach is central to explainable AI (XAI),
tackling the interpretation of the black box. By synergizing these approaches,
the exploration of how a model's internal mechanisms illuminate its causal
effect has become integral for evidence-based decision-making. A parallel line
of research has revealed that intersectionality - the combinatory impact of
multiple demographics of an individual - can be structured in the form of an
Averaged Treatment Effect (ATE). Initially, this study illustrates that the
hateful memes detection problem can be formulated as an ATE, assisted by the
principles of intersectionality, and that a modality-wise summarization of
gradient-based attention attribution scores can delineate the distinct
behaviors of three Transformerbased models concerning ATE. Subsequently, we
show that the latest LLM LLaMA2 has the ability to disentangle the
intersectional nature of memes detection in an in-context learning setting,
with their mechanistic properties elucidated via meta-gradient, a secondary
form of gradient. In conclusion, this research contributes to the ongoing
dialogue surrounding XAI and the multifaceted nature of ML models.

<p class="mathjax">In the modern era of Deep Learning, network parameters play a vital role in
models efficiency but it has its own limitations like extensive computations
and memory requirements, which may not be suitable for real time intelligent
robot grasping tasks. Current research focuses on how the model efficiency can
be maintained by introducing sparsity but without compromising accuracy of the
model in the robot grasping domain. More specifically, in this research two
light-weighted neural networks have been introduced, namely Sparse-GRConvNet
and Sparse-GINNet, which leverage sparsity in the robotic grasping domain for
grasp pose generation by integrating the Edge-PopUp algorithm. This algorithm
facilitates the identification of the top K% of edges by considering their
respective score values. Both the Sparse-GRConvNet and Sparse-GINNet models are
designed to generate high-quality grasp poses in real-time at every pixel
location, enabling robots to effectively manipulate unfamiliar objects. We
extensively trained our models using two benchmark datasets: Cornell Grasping
Dataset (CGD) and Jacquard Grasping Dataset (JGD). Both Sparse-GRConvNet and
Sparse-GINNet models outperform the current state-of-the-art methods in terms
of performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.75% with only 10% of the
weight of GR-ConvNet and 50% of the weight of GI-NNet, respectively, on CGD.
Additionally, Sparse-GRConvNet achieve an accuracy of 85.77% with 30% of the
weight of GR-ConvNet and Sparse-GINNet achieve an accuracy of 81.11% with 10%
of the weight of GI-NNet on JGD. To validate the performance of our proposed
models, we conducted extensive experiments using the Anukul (Baxter) hardware
cobot.

<p class="mathjax">Depression is a common yet serious mental disorder that affects millions of
U.S. high schoolers every year. Still, accurate diagnosis and early detection
remain significant challenges. In the field of public health, research shows
that neural networks produce promising results in identifying other diseases
such as cancer and HIV. This study proposes a similar approach, utilizing
machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) models to classify
depression in a student. Additionally, the study highlights the differences in
relevant factors for race subgroups and advocates the need for more extensive
and diverse datasets. The models train on nationwide Youth Risk Behavior
Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey data, in which the most relevant factors of
depression are found with statistical analysis. The survey data is a structured
dataset with 15000 entries including three race subsets each consisting of 900
entries. For classification, the research problem is modeled as a supervised
learning binary classification problem. Factors relevant to depression for
different racial subgroups are also identified. The ML and ANN models are
trained on the entire dataset followed by different race subsets to classify
whether an individual has depression. The ANN model achieves the highest F1
score of 82.90% while the best-performing machine learning model, support
vector machines (SVM), achieves a score of 81.90%. This study reveals that
different parameters are more valuable for modeling depression across diverse
racial groups and furthers research regarding American youth depression.

<p class="mathjax">In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), tremendous strides have been made
in the field of multimodal understanding. However, existing advanced algorithms
are limited to effectively utilizing the immense representation capabilities
and rich world knowledge inherent to these large pre-trained models, and the
beneficial connections among tasks within the context of text-rich scenarios
have not been sufficiently explored. In this work, we introduce UniDoc, a novel
multimodal model equipped with text detection and recognition capabilities,
which are deficient in existing approaches. Moreover, UniDoc capitalizes on the
beneficial interactions among tasks to enhance the performance of each
individual task. To implement UniDoc, we perform unified multimodal instruct

Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that UniDoc sets
state-of-the-art scores across multiple challenging benchmarks. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first large multimodal model capable of simultaneous
text detection, recognition, spotting, and understanding.

<p class="mathjax">What does it take to create the Babel Fish, a tool that can help individuals
translate speech between any two languages? While recent breakthroughs in
text-based models have pushed machine translation coverage beyond 200
languages, unified speech-to-speech translation models have yet to achieve
similar strides. More specifically, conventional speech-to-speech translation
systems rely on cascaded systems that perform translation progressively,
putting high-performing unified systems out of reach. To address these gaps, we
introduce SeamlessM4T, a single model that supports speech-to-speech
translation, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech translation,
text-to-text translation, and automatic speech recognition for up to 100
languages. To build this, we used 1 million hours of open speech audio data to
learn self-supervised speech representations with w2v-BERT 2.0. Subsequently,
we created a multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations.
Filtered and combined with human-labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we developed
the first multilingual system capable of translating from and into English for
both speech and text. On FLEURS, SeamlessM4T sets a new standard for
translations into multiple target languages, achieving an improvement of 20%
BLEU over the previous SOTA in direct speech-to-text translation. Compared to
strong cascaded models, SeamlessM4T improves the quality of into-English
translation by 1.3 BLEU points in speech-to-text and by 2.6 ASR-BLEU points in
speech-to-speech. Tested for robustness, our system performs better against
background noises and speaker variations in speech-to-text tasks compared to
the current SOTA model. Critically, we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and
added toxicity to assess translation safety. Finally, all contributions in this

<p class="mathjax">Extended Reality (XR) is a rapidly growing field offering unique immersive
experiences, social networking, learning, and collaboration opportunities. The
continuous advancements in XR technology and industry efforts are gradually
moving this technology toward end consumers. However, a universal
one-size-fits-all solution for seamless XR interaction still needs to be
discovered. Currently, we face a diverse landscape of interaction modalities
that depend on the environment, user preferences, task, and device
capabilities. Commercially available input methods like handheld controllers,
hand gestures, voice commands, and combinations of those need universal
flexibility and expressiveness. Additionally, hybrid user interfaces, such as
smartwatches and smartphones as ubiquitous input and output devices, expand
this interaction design space. In this position paper, we discuss the idea of a
universal interaction concept for XR. We present challenges and opportunities
for implementing hybrid user interfaces, emphasizing Environment, Task, and
User. We explore the potential to enhance user experiences, interaction
capabilities, and the development of seamless and efficient XR interaction
methods. We examine challenges and aim to stimulate a discussion on the design
of generic, universal interfaces for XR.

<p class="mathjax">The introduction of the transformer architecture and the self-attention
mechanism has led to an explosive production of language models trained on
specific downstream tasks and data domains. With over 200, 000 models in the
Hugging Face ecosystem, users grapple with selecting and optimizing models to
suit multifaceted workflows and data domains while addressing computational,
security, and recency concerns. There is an urgent need for machine learning
frameworks that can eliminate the burden of model selection and customization
and unleash the incredible power of the vast emerging model library for end
users. Here, we propose a context-aware routing system, Tryage, that leverages
a language model router for optimal selection of expert models from a model
library based on analysis of individual input prompts. Inspired by the thalamic
router in the brain, Tryage employs a perceptive router to predict down-stream
model performance on prompts and, then, makes a routing decision using an
objective function that integrates performance predictions with user goals and
constraints that are incorporated through flags (e.g., model size, model
recency). Tryage allows users to explore a Pareto front and automatically
trade-off between task accuracy and secondary goals including minimization of
model size, recency, security, verbosity, and readability. Across heterogeneous
data sets that include code, text, clinical data, and patents, the Tryage
framework surpasses Gorilla and GPT3.5 turbo in dynamic model selection
identifying the optimal model with an accuracy of 50.9% , compared to 23.6% by
GPT 3.5 Turbo and 10.8% by Gorilla. Conceptually, Tryage demonstrates how
routing models can be applied to program and control the behavior of
multi-model LLM systems to maximize efficient use of the expanding and evolving
language model ecosystem.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated
significant advancements in data reconstruction compared to separate
source-channel coding (SSCC). This superiority arises from the suboptimality of
SSCC when dealing with finite block-length data. Moreover, SSCC falls short in
reconstructing data in a multi-user and/or multi-resolution fashion, as it only
tries to satisfy the worst channel and/or the highest quality data. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning multi-resolution JSCC
framework inspired by the concept of multi-task learning (MTL). This proposed
framework excels at encoding data for different resolutions through
hierarchical layers and effectively decodes it by leveraging both current and
past layers of encoded data. Moreover, this framework holds great potential for
semantic communication, where the objective extends beyond data reconstruction
to preserving specific semantic attributes throughout the communication
process. These semantic features could be crucial elements such as class
labels, essential for classification tasks, or other key attributes that
require preservation. Within this framework, each level of encoded data can be
carefully designed to retain specific data semantics. As a result, the
precision of a semantic classifier can be progressively enhanced across
successive layers, emphasizing the preservation of targeted semantics
throughout the encoding and decoding stages. We conduct experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR10 dataset. The experiment with both datasets illustrates that our
proposed method is capable of surpassing the SSCC method in reconstructing data
with different resolutions, enabling the extraction of semantic features with
heightened confidence in successive layers. This capability is particularly
advantageous for prioritizing and preserving more crucial semantic features
within the datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
success in visual recognition tasks by embedding images in a semantically rich
space. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has also shown promise in improving
visual recognition by learning invariant features. However, the combination of
CLIP with SSL is found to face challenges due to the multi-task framework that
blends CLIP's contrastive loss and SSL's loss, including difficulties with loss
weighting and inconsistency among different views of images in CLIP's output
space. To overcome these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based model
called GOPro, which is a unified framework that ensures similarity between
various augmented views of input images in a shared image-text embedding space,
using a pair of learnable image and text projectors atop CLIP, to promote
invariance and generalizability. To automatically learn such prompts, we
leverage the visual content and style primitives extracted from pre-trained
CLIP and adapt them to the target task. In addition to CLIP's cross-domain
contrastive loss, we introduce a visual contrastive loss and a novel prompt
consistency loss, considering the different views of the images. GOPro is
trained end-to-end on all three loss objectives, combining the strengths of
CLIP and SSL in a principled manner. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
GOPro outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting techniques on three
challenging domain generalization tasks across multiple benchmarks by a
significant margin. Our code is available at
https://github.com/mainaksingha01/GOPro.

<p class="mathjax">Generating video stories from text prompts is a complex task. In addition to
having high visual quality, videos need to realistically adhere to a sequence
of text prompts whilst being consistent throughout the frames. Creating a
benchmark for video generation requires data annotated over time, which
contrasts with the single caption used often in video datasets. To fill this
gap, we collect comprehensive human annotations on three existing datasets, and
introduce StoryBench: a new, challenging multi-task benchmark to reliably
evaluate forthcoming text-to-video models. Our benchmark includes three video
generation tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, where the next
action must be generated starting from a conditioning video; story
continuation, where a sequence of actions must be executed starting from a
conditioning video; and story generation, where a video must be generated from
only text prompts. We evaluate small yet strong text-to-video baselines, and
show the benefits of training on story-like data algorithmically generated from
existing video captions. Finally, we establish guidelines for human evaluation
of video stories, and reaffirm the need of better automatic metrics for video
generation. StoryBench aims at encouraging future research efforts in this
exciting new area.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances of monocular 3D object detection facilitate the 3D
multi-object tracking task based on low-cost camera sensors. In this paper, we
find that the motion cue of objects along different time frames is critical in
3D multi-object tracking, which is less explored in existing monocular-based
approaches. In this paper, we propose a motion-aware framework for monocular 3D
MOT. To this end, we propose MoMA-M3T, a framework that mainly consists of
three motion-aware components. First, we represent the possible movement of an
object related to all object tracklets in the feature space as its motion
features. Then, we further model the historical object tracklet along the time
frame in a spatial-temporal perspective via a motion transformer. Finally, we
propose a motion-aware matching module to associate historical object tracklets
and current observations as final tracking results. We conduct extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets to demonstrate that our MoMA-M3T
achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the proposed tracker is flexible and can be easily plugged into existing
image-based 3D object detectors without re-training. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/kuanchihhuang/MoMA-M3T.

<p class="mathjax">Hands are dexterous and highly versatile manipulators that are central to how
humans interact with objects and their environment. Consequently, modeling
realistic hand-object interactions, including the subtle motion of individual
fingers, is critical for applications in computer graphics, computer vision,
and mixed reality. Prior work on capturing and modeling humans interacting with
objects in 3D focuses on the body and object motion, often ignoring hand pose.
In contrast, we introduce GRIP, a learning-based method that takes, as input,
the 3D motion of the body and the object, and synthesizes realistic motion for
both hands before, during, and after object interaction. As a preliminary step
before synthesizing the hand motion, we first use a network, ANet, to denoise
the arm motion. Then, we leverage the spatio-temporal relationship between the
body and the object to extract two types of novel temporal interaction cues,
and use them in a two-stage inference pipeline to generate the hand motion. In
the first stage, we introduce a new approach to enforce motion temporal
consistency in the latent space (LTC), and generate consistent interaction
motions. In the second stage, GRIP generates refined hand poses to avoid
hand-object penetrations. Given sequences of noisy body and object motion, GRIP
upgrades them to include hand-object interaction. Quantitative experiments and
perceptual studies demonstrate that GRIP outperforms baseline methods and
generalizes to unseen objects and motions from different motion-capture
datasets.

to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Electrostimulation, carried
out by implanting electrodes into an identified focus in the brain, makes it
possible to reduce the symptoms of the disease significantly. In this paper, a
method for analyzing recordings of neuronal activity acquired during DBS
neurosurgery using deep learning is presented. We tested using a convolutional

assesses whether neuronal activity (spike) is present. The maximum accuracy

four major Ghanaian cities representing distinct climatic zones. Using NASA's
Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) data, statistical analyses
assess local climate warming and its implications. Linear regression trend
analysis and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning predict

XGBoost model's low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) scores demonstrate
effectiveness in capturing temperature patterns. Wa unexpectedly has the

<p class="mathjax">While multi-modal learning has been widely used for MRI reconstruction, it
relies on paired multi-modal data which is difficult to acquire in real
clinical scenarios. Especially in the federated setting, the common situation
is that several medical institutions only have single-modal data, termed the
modality missing issue. Therefore, it is infeasible to deploy a standard
federated learning framework in such conditions. In this paper, we propose a
novel communication-efficient federated learning framework, namely Fed-PMG, to
address the missing modality challenge in federated multi-modal MRI
reconstruction. Specifically, we utilize a pseudo modality generation mechanism
to recover the missing modality for each single-modal client by sharing the
distribution information of the amplitude spectrum in frequency space. However,
the step of sharing the original amplitude spectrum leads to heavy
communication costs. To reduce the communication cost, we introduce a
clustering scheme to project the set of amplitude spectrum into finite cluster
centroids, and share them among the clients. With such an elaborate design, our
approach can effectively complete the missing modality within an acceptable
communication cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
can attain similar performance with the ideal scenario, i.e., all clients have
the full set of modalities. The source code will be released.

<p class="mathjax">Humans construct internal cognitive maps of their environment directly from
sensory inputs without access to a system of explicit coordinates or distance
measurements. While machine learning algorithms like SLAM utilize specialized
visual inference procedures to identify visual features and construct spatial
maps from visual and odometry data, the general nature of cognitive maps in the
brain suggests a unified mapping algorithmic strategy that can generalize to
auditory, tactile, and linguistic inputs. Here, we demonstrate that predictive
coding provides a natural and versatile neural network algorithm for
constructing spatial maps using sensory data. We introduce a framework in which
an agent navigates a virtual environment while engaging in visual predictive
coding using a self-attention-equipped convolutional neural network. While
learning a next image prediction task, the agent automatically constructs an
internal representation of the environment that quantitatively reflects
distances. The internal map enables the agent to pinpoint its location relative
to landmarks using only visual information.The predictive coding network
generates a vectorized encoding of the environment that supports vector
navigation where individual latent space units delineate localized, overlapping
neighborhoods in the environment. Broadly, our work introduces predictive
coding as a unified algorithmic framework for constructing cognitive maps that
can naturally extend to the mapping of auditory, sensorimotor, and linguistic
inputs.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the high heterogeneity and clinical characteristics of cancer, there
are significant differences in multi-omic data and clinical characteristics
among different cancer subtypes. Therefore, accurate classification of cancer
subtypes can help doctors choose the most appropriate treatment options,
improve treatment outcomes, and provide more accurate patient survival
predictions. In this study, we propose a supervised multi-head attention
mechanism model (SMA) to classify cancer subtypes successfully. The attention
mechanism and feature sharing module of the SMA model can successfully learn
the global and local feature information of multi-omics data. Second, it
enriches the parameters of the model by deeply fusing multi-head attention
encoders from Siamese through the fusion module. Validated by extensive
experiments, the SMA model achieves the highest accuracy, F1 macroscopic, F1
weighted, and accurate classification of cancer subtypes in simulated,
single-cell, and cancer multiomics datasets compared to AE, CNN, and GNN-based
models. Therefore, we contribute to future research on multiomics data using
our attention-based approach.

<p class="mathjax">Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) emerge as promising agents against
antimicrobial resistance, providing an alternative to conventional antibiotics.
Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionized AMP discovery through both
discrimination and generation approaches. The discriminators aid the
identification of promising candidates by predicting key peptide properties
such as activity and toxicity, while the generators learn the distribution over
peptides and enable sampling novel AMP candidates, either de novo, or as
analogues of a prototype peptide. Moreover, the controlled generation of AMPs
with desired properties is achieved by discriminator-guided filtering,
positive-only learning, latent space sampling, as well as conditional and
optimized generation. Here we review recent achievements in AI-driven AMP
discovery, highlighting the most exciting directions.

extracting white matter pathways. The proposed method combines an iterative
registration procedure with a recently developed precise streamline search
algorithm that enables efficient segmentation of streamlines without the need
for tractogram clustering or simplifying assumptions. We show that BundleSeg
achieves improved repeatability and reproducibility than state-of-the-art

<p class="mathjax">Christol's theorem states that a power series with coefficients in a finite
field is algebraic if and only if its coefficient sequence is automatic. A
natural question is how the size of a polynomial describing such a sequence
relates to the size of an automaton describing the same sequence. Bridy used
tools from algebraic geometry to bound the size of the minimal automaton for a
sequence, given its minimal polynomial. We produce a new proof of Bridy's bound
by embedding algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions. Crucially
for our interests, our approach can be adapted to work not just over a finite
field but over the integers modulo $p^\alpha$.

<p class="mathjax">Probabilistic computing is a novel computing scheme that offers a more
efficient approach than conventional CMOS-based logic in a variety of
applications ranging from optimization to Bayesian inference, and invertible
Boolean logic. The probabilistic-bit (or p-bit, the base unit of probabilistic
computing) is a naturally fluctuating entity that requires tunable
stochasticity; by coupling low-barrier stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
(MTJs) with a transistor circuit, a compact implementation is achieved. In this
work, through integrating stochastic MTJs with 2D-MoS$_{2}$ FETs, the first
on-chip realization of a key p-bit building block displaying
voltage-controllable stochasticity is demonstrated. In addition, supported by
circuit simulations, this work provides a careful analysis of the three
transistor-one magnetic tunnel junction (3T-1MTJ) p-bit design, evaluating how
the characteristics of each component influence the overall p-bit output. This
understanding of the interplay between the characteristics of the transistors
and the MTJ is vital for the construction of a fully functioning p-bit, making
the design rules presented in this article key for future experimental
implementations of scaled on-chip p-bit networks.

particular organ performing its main function. The FTUs provide crucial
information to the pathologist in understanding the disease affecting a
particular organ by providing information at the cellular level. In our
research, we have developed a model to segment multi-organ FTUs across 5 organs
namely: the kidney, large intestine, lung, prostate and spleen by utilizing the
HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body competition dataset. We propose adding
shifted auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome
the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal
training of deep models. Overall, our model achieved a dice score of 0.793 on
the public dataset and 0.778 on the private dataset and shows a 1% improvement
with the use of the proposed method. The findings also bolster the use of
transformers models for dense prediction tasks in the field of medical image
analysis. The study assists in understanding the relationships between cell and
tissue organization thereby providing a useful medium to look at the impact of
cellular functions on human health.

techniques for accurate analysis and precise forecasting to mitigate its
impact. In recent years, deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising
approach for weather forecasting and understanding the dynamics of extreme
weather events. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the
state-of-the-art deep learning in the field. We explore the utilization of deep
learning architectures, across various aspects of weather prediction such as
thunderstorm, lightning, precipitation, drought, heatwave, cold waves and
tropical cyclones. We highlight the potential of deep learning, such as its
ability to capture complex patterns and non-linear relationships. Additionally,
we discuss the limitations of current approaches and highlight future
directions for advancements in the field of meteorology. The insights gained
from this systematic review are crucial for the scientific community to make

<p class="mathjax">Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and its short atmospheric
half-life makes it a prime target to rapidly curb global warming. However,
current methane emission monitoring techniques primarily rely on approximate
emission factors or self-reporting, which have been shown to often dramatically
underestimate emissions. Although initially designed to monitor surface
properties, satellite multispectral data has recently emerged as a powerful
method to analyze atmospheric content. However, the spectral resolution of
multispectral instruments is poor, and methane measurements are typically very
noisy. Methane data products are also sensitive to absorption by the surface
and other atmospheric gases (water vapor in particular) and therefore provide
noisy maps of potential methane plumes, that typically require extensive human
analysis. Here, we show that the image recognition capabilities of deep
learning methods can be leveraged to automatize the detection of methane leaks
in Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral data, with dramatically reduced false
positive rates compared with state-of-the-art multispectral methane data
products, and without the need for a priori knowledge of potential leak sites.
Our proposed approach paves the way for the automated, high-definition and
high-frequency monitoring of point-source methane emissions across the world.

<p class="mathjax">Logistic hubs play a pivotal role in the last-mile delivery distance; even a
slight increment in distance negatively impacts the business of the e-commerce
industry while also increasing its carbon footprint. The growth of this
industry, particularly after Covid-19, has further intensified the need for
optimized allocation of resources in an urban environment. In this study, we
use a hybrid approach to optimize the placement of logistic hubs. The approach
sequentially employs different techniques. Initially, delivery points are
clustered using K-Means in relation to their spatial locations. The clustering
method utilizes road network distances as opposed to Euclidean distances.
Non-road network-based approaches have been avoided since they lead to
erroneous and misleading results. Finally, hubs are located using the P-Median
method. The P-Median method also incorporates the number of deliveries and
population as weights. Real-world delivery data from Muller and Phipps (M&amp;P) is
used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Serving deliveries from
the optimal hub locations results in the saving of 815 (10%) meters per

<p class="mathjax">For machine learning-based prognosis and diagnosis of rare diseases, such as
pediatric brain tumors, it is necessary to gather medical imaging data from
multiple clinical sites that may use different devices and protocols. Deep
learning-driven harmonization of radiologic images relies on generative
adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs notoriously generate pseudo
structures that do not exist in the original training data, a phenomenon known
as "hallucination". To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as
magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning
method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization. At test time,
the method uses one image from a clinical site to generate an image that
matches the intensity scale of the collaborating sites. Our approach combines
learning a feature extractor, neural style transfer, and adaptive instance
normalization. We further propose a novel strategy to evaluate the
effectiveness of image harmonization approaches with evaluation metrics that
both measure image style harmonization and assess the preservation of
anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method in preserving patient anatomy while adjusting the image intensities
to a new clinical site. Our general harmonization model can be used on unseen
data from new sites, making it a valuable tool for real-world medical
applications and clinical trials.

trainable filters are used to replace manually designed filters for dimension
reduction. For time compression, only using frame skipped prediction causes
large performance degradation, which can be alleviated by a post-processing
network with full sequence modeling. We have found that under fixed compression
ratios, dual-path compression combining both the time and frequency methods
will give further performance improvement, covering compression ratios from 4x
to 32x with little model size change. Moreover, the proposed models show
competitive performance compared with fast FullSubNet and DeepFilterNet. A demo

<p class="mathjax">The renormalization group (RG) is an essential technique in statistical
physics and quantum field theory, which considers scale-invariant properties of
physical theories and how these theories' parameters change with scaling. Deep
learning is a powerful computational technique that uses multi-layered neural
networks to solve a myriad of complicated problems. Previous research suggests
the possibility that unsupervised deep learning may be a form of RG flow, by
being a layer-by-layer coarse graining of the original data. We examined this
connection on a more rigorous basis for the simple example of Kadanoff block
renormalization of the 2D nearest-neighbor Ising model, with our deep learning
accomplished via Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We developed extensive
renormalization techniques for the 1D and 2D Ising model to provide a baseline
for comparison. For the 1D Ising model, we successfully used Adam optimization
on a correlation length loss function to learn the group flow, yielding results
consistent with the analytical model for infinite N. For the 2D Ising model, we
successfully generated Ising model samples using the Wolff algorithm, and
performed the group flow using a quasi-deterministic method, validating these
results by calculating the critical exponent \nu. We then examined RBM learning
of the Ising model layer by layer, finding a blocking structure in the learning
that is qualitatively similar to RG. Lastly, we directly compared the weights
of each layer from the learning to Ising spin renormalization, but found
quantitative inconsistencies for the simple case of nearest-neighbor Ising
models.

<p class="mathjax">Data-driven constitutive modeling frameworks based on neural networks and
classical representation theorems have recently gained considerable attention
due to their ability to easily incorporate constitutive constraints and their
excellent generalization performance. In these models, the stress prediction
follows from a linear combination of invariant-dependent coefficient functions
and known tensor basis generators. However, thus far the formulations have been
limited to stress representations based on the classical Rivlin and Ericksen
form, while the performance of alternative representations has yet to be
investigated. In this work, we survey a variety of tensor basis neural network
models for modeling hyperelastic materials in a finite deformation context,
including a number of so far unexplored formulations which use theoretically
equivalent invariants and generators to Finger-Rivlin-Ericksen. Furthermore, we
compare potential-based and coefficient-based approaches, as well as different
calibration techniques. Nine variants are tested against both noisy and
noiseless datasets for three different materials. Theoretical and practical
insights into the performance of each formulation are given.

<p class="mathjax">In the balanced allocations framework, there are $m$ jobs (balls) to be
allocated to $n$ servers (bins). The goal is to minimize the gap, the
difference between the maximum and the average load.
<br />Peres, Talwar and Wieder (RSA 2015) used the hyperbolic cosine potential
function to analyze a large family of allocation processes including the
$(1+\beta)$-process and graphical balanced allocations. The key ingredient was
to prove that the potential drops in every step, i.e., a drift inequality.
<br />In this work we improve the drift inequality so that (i) it is asymptotically
tighter, (ii) it assumes weaker preconditions, (iii) it applies not only to
processes allocating to more than one bin in a single step and (iv) to
processes allocating a varying number of balls depending on the sampled bin.
Our applications include the processes of (RSA 2015), but also several new
processes, and we believe that our techniques may lead to further results in
future work.

<p class="mathjax">Interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep
neural networks, is of great interest due to the widespread use of AI-backed
systems, which often have unexplainable behavior. The interpretability of such
models is a crucial component of building trusted systems. Many methods exist
to approach this problem, but they do not obviously generalize to the quantum
setting. Here we explore the interpretability of quantum neural networks using
local model-agnostic interpretability measures of quantum and classical neural
networks. We introduce the concept of the band of inexplicability, representing
the interpretable region in which data samples have no explanation, likely
victims of inherently random quantum measurements. We see this as a step toward
understanding how to build responsible and accountable quantum AI models.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel quantum pre-processing filter (QPF) to improve
the image classification accuracy of neural network (NN) models. A simple four
qubit quantum circuit that uses Y rotation gates for encoding and two
controlled NOT gates for creating correlation among the qubits is applied as a
feature extraction filter prior to passing data into the fully connected NN
architecture. By applying the QPF approach, the results show that the image
classification accuracy based on the MNIST (handwritten 10 digits) and the
EMNIST (handwritten 47 class digits and letters) datasets can be improved, from
92.5% to 95.4% and from 68.9% to 75.9%, respectively. These improvements were
obtained without introducing extra model parameters or optimizations in the
machine learning process. However, tests performed on the developed QPF
approach against a relatively complex GTSRB dataset with 43 distinct class
real-life traffic sign images showed a degradation in the classification
accuracy. Considering this result, further research into the understanding and
the design of a more suitable quantum circuit approach for image classification
neural networks could be explored utilizing the baseline method proposed in
this paper.

algorithms may falter due to a variety of reasons, including technical ones as

<p class="mathjax">Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide.
They include a group of malignant neoplasms with a variety of biological,
clinical, and histopathological characteristics. There are more than 35
different histological forms of breast lesions that can be classified and
diagnosed histologically according to cell morphology, growth, and architecture
patterns. Recently, deep learning, in the field of artificial intelligence, has
drawn a lot of attention for the computerized representation of medical images.
Searchable digital atlases can provide pathologists with patch matching tools
allowing them to search among evidently diagnosed and treated archival cases, a
technology that may be regarded as computational second opinion. In this study,
we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th
Ed.) spanning 35 tumour types. We visualized all tumour types using deep
features extracted from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, pre-trained on
millions of diagnostic histopathology images from the TCGA repository.
Furthermore, we test the concept of a digital "atlas" as a reference for search
and matching with rare test cases. The patch similarity search within the WHO
breast taxonomy data reached over 88% accuracy when validating through
"majority vote" and more than 91% accuracy when validating using top-n tumour
types. These results show for the first time that complex relationships among
common and rare breast lesions can be investigated using an indexed digital
archive.

<p class="mathjax">T1 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) technique that
has emerged as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of diffuse myocardial diseases.
However, prevailing approaches have relied heavily on breath-hold sequences to
eliminate respiratory motion artifacts. This limitation hinders accessibility
and effectiveness for patients who cannot tolerate breath-holding. Image
registration can be used to enable free-breathing T1 mapping. Yet, inherent
intensity differences between the different time points make the registration
task challenging. We introduce PCMC-T1, a physically-constrained deep-learning
model for motion correction in free-breathing T1 mapping. We incorporate the
signal decay model into the network architecture to encourage
physically-plausible deformations along the longitudinal relaxation axis. We
compared PCMC-T1 to baseline deep-learning-based image registration approaches
using a 5-fold experimental setup on a publicly available dataset of 210
patients. PCMC-T1 demonstrated superior model fitting quality (R2: 0.955) and
achieved the highest clinical impact (clinical score: 3.93) compared to
baseline methods (0.941, 0.946 and 3.34, 3.62 respectively). Anatomical
alignment results were comparable (Dice score: 0.9835 vs. 0.984, 0.988). Our
code and trained models are available at https://github.com/eyalhana/PCMC-T1.

<p class="mathjax">Ridepooling services play an increasingly important role in modern
transportation systems. With soaring demand and growing fleet sizes, the
underlying route planning problems become increasingly challenging. In this
context, we consider the dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Given a set of
transportation requests with pick-up and delivery locations, passenger numbers,
time windows, and maximum ride times, an optimal routing for a fleet of
vehicles, including an optimized passenger assignment, needs to be determined.
We present tight mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for the
DARP by combining two state-of-the-art models into novel
location-augmented-event-based formulations. Strong valid inequalities and
lower and upper bounding techniques are derived to further improve the
formulations. We then demonstrate the theoretical and computational superiority
of the new model: First, the formulation is tight in the sense that, if time
windows shrink to a single point in time, the linear programming relaxation
yields integer (and hence optimal) solutions. Second, extensive numerical
experiments on benchmark instances show that computational times are on average
reduced by 49.7% compared to state-of-the-art event-based approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the dynamics of large quantum systems is hindered by the curse
of dimensionality. Statistical learning offers new possibilities in this regime
by neural-network protocols and classical shadows, while both methods have
limitations: the former is plagued by the predictive uncertainty and the latter
lacks the generalization ability. Here we propose a data-centric learning
paradigm combining the strength of these two approaches to facilitate diverse
quantum system learning (QSL) tasks. Particularly, our paradigm utilizes
classical shadows along with other easily obtainable information of quantum
systems to create the training dataset, which is then learnt by neural networks
to unveil the underlying mapping rule of the explored QSL problem. Capitalizing
on the generalization power of neural networks, this paradigm can be trained
offline and excel at predicting previously unseen systems at the inference
stage, even with few state copies. Besides, it inherits the characteristic of
classical shadows, enabling memory-efficient storage and faithful prediction.
These features underscore the immense potential of the proposed data-centric
approach in discovering novel and large-scale quantum systems. For
concreteness, we present the instantiation of our paradigm in quantum state
tomography and direct fidelity estimation tasks and conduct numerical analysis
up to 60 qubits. Our work showcases the profound prospects of data-centric
artificial intelligence to advance QSL in a faithful and generalizable manner.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the concept of network momentum, a novel trading signal
derived from momentum spillover across assets. Initially observed within the
confines of pairwise economic and fundamental ties, such as the stock-bond
connection of the same company and stocks linked through supply-demand chains,
momentum spillover implies a propagation of momentum risk premium from one
asset to another. The similarity of momentum risk premium, exemplified by
co-movement patterns, has been spotted across multiple asset classes including
commodities, equities, bonds and currencies. However, studying the network
effect of momentum spillover across these classes has been challenging due to a
lack of readily available common characteristics or economic ties beyond the
company level. In this paper, we explore the interconnections of momentum
features across a diverse range of 64 continuous future contracts spanning
these four classes. We utilise a linear and interpretable graph learning model
with minimal assumptions to reveal the intricacies of the momentum spillover
network. By leveraging the learned networks, we construct a network momentum
strategy that exhibits a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 and an annual return of 22%, after
volatility scaling, from 2000 to 2022. This paper pioneers the examination of
momentum spillover across multiple asset classes using only pricing data,
presents a multi-asset investment strategy based on network momentum, and
underscores the effectiveness of this strategy through robust empirical
analysis.

productivity gains but also opens up questions about the impact of these new
powerful technologies on the way we work and share knowledge. More
specifically, we explore how ChatGPT changed a fundamental aspect of coding:
problem-solving. To do so, we exploit the effect of the sudden release of
ChatGPT on the 30th of November 2022 on the usage of the largest online
community for coders: Stack Overflow. Using quasi-experimental methods
(Difference-in-Difference), we find a significant drop in the number of
questions. In addition, the questions are better documented after the release
of ChatGPT. Finally, we find evidence that the remaining questions are more
complex. These findings suggest not only productivity gains but also a
fundamental change in the way we work where routine inquiries are solved by AI
allowing humans to focus on more complex tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Speaker anonymization systems continue to improve their ability to obfuscate
the original speaker characteristics in a speech signal, but often create
processing artifacts and unnatural sounding voices as a tradeoff. Many of those
systems stem from the VoicePrivacy Challenge (VPC) Baseline B1, using a neural
vocoder to synthesize speech from an F0, x-vectors and bottleneck
features-based speech representation. Inspired by this, we investigate the
reproduction capabilities of the aforementioned baseline, to assess how
successful the shared methodology is in synthesizing human-like speech. We use
four objective metrics to measure speech quality, waveform similarity, and F0
similarity. Our findings indicate that both the speech representation and the
vocoder introduces artifacts, causing an unnatural perception. A MUSHRA-like
listening test on 18 subjects corroborate our findings, motivating further
research on the analysis and synthesis components of the VPC Baseline B1.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel, interdisciplinary study that leverages a Machine
Learning (ML) assisted framework to explore the geometry of affine
Deligne-Lusztig varieties (ADLV). The primary objective is to investigate the
nonemptiness pattern, dimension and enumeration of irreducible components of
ADLV. Our proposed framework demonstrates a recursive pipeline of data
generation, model training, pattern analysis, and human examination, presenting
an intricate interplay between ML and pure mathematical research. Notably, our
data-generation process is nuanced, emphasizing the selection of meaningful
subsets and appropriate feature sets. We demonstrate that this framework has a
potential to accelerate pure mathematical research, leading to the discovery of
new conjectures and promising research directions that could otherwise take
significant time to uncover. We rediscover the virtual dimension formula and
provide a full mathematical proof of a newly identified problem concerning a
certain lower bound of dimension. Furthermore, we extend an open invitation to
the readers by providing the source code for computing ADLV and the ML models,
promoting further explorations. This paper concludes by sharing valuable
experiences and highlighting lessons learned from this collaboration.

<p class="mathjax">In many parameter estimation problems, the exact model is unknown and is
assumed to belong to a set of candidate models. In such cases, a predetermined
data-based selection rule selects a parametric model from a set of candidates
before the parameter estimation. The existing framework for estimation under
model misspecification does not account for the selection process that led to
the misspecified model. Moreover, in post-model-selection estimation, there are
multiple candidate models chosen based on the observations, making the
interpretation of the assumed model in the misspecified setting non-trivial. In
this work, we present three interpretations to address the problem of
non-Bayesian post-model-selection estimation as an estimation under model
misspecification problem: the naive interpretation, the normalized
interpretation, and the selective inference interpretation, and discuss their
properties. For each of these interpretations, we developed the corresponding
misspecified maximum likelihood estimator and the misspecified
Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao-type lower bound. The relations between the
estimators and the performance bounds, as well as their properties, are
discussed. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimators
and bounds via simulations of estimation after channel selection. We show that
the proposed performance bounds are more informative than the oracle
Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao Bound (CRB), where the third interpretation
(selective inference) results in the lowest mean-squared-error (MSE) among the
estimators.

<p class="mathjax">Measures of algorithmic fairness are usually discussed in the context of
binary decisions. We extend the approach to continuous scores. So far,
ROC-based measures have mainly been suggested for this purpose. Other existing
methods depend heavily on the distribution of scores, are unsuitable for
ranking tasks, or their effect sizes are not interpretable. Here, we propose a
distributionally invariant version of fairness measures for continuous scores
with a reasonable interpretation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our
measures are easily computable and well suited for quantifying and interpreting
the strength of group disparities as well as for comparing biases across
different models, datasets, or time points. We derive a link between the
different families of existing fairness measures for scores and show that the
proposed distributionally invariant fairness measures outperform ROC-based
fairness measures because they are more explicit and can quantify significant
biases that ROC-based fairness measures miss. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness through experiments on the most commonly used fairness benchmark
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not
redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR). To do so, we extract DLR features
using a VAE while enforcing their independence with HCR features by minimizing
their mutual information. The resulting DLR features can be combined with
hand-crafted ones and leveraged by a classifier to predict early markers of
cancer. We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and
validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of
combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in
the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address
redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.

<p class="mathjax">Regression analysis is a key area of interest in the field of data analysis
and machine learning which is devoted to exploring the dependencies between
variables, often using vectors. The emergence of high dimensional data in
technologies such as neuroimaging, computer vision, climatology and social
networks, has brought challenges to traditional data representation methods.
Tensors, as high dimensional extensions of vectors, are considered as natural
representations of high dimensional data. In this book, the authors provide a
systematic study and analysis of tensor-based regression models and their
applications in recent years. It groups and illustrates the existing
tensor-based regression methods and covers the basics, core ideas, and
theoretical characteristics of most tensor-based regression methods. In
addition, readers can learn how to use existing tensor-based regression methods
to solve specific regression tasks with multiway data, what datasets can be
selected, and what software packages are available to start related work as
soon as possible. Tensor Regression is the first thorough overview of the
fundamentals, motivations, popular algorithms, strategies for efficient
implementation, related applications, available datasets, and software
resources for tensor-based regression analysis. It is essential reading for all
students, researchers and practitioners of working on high dimensional data.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an iterative distributionally robust model predictive
control (MPC) scheme to solve a risk-constrained infinite-horizon optimal
control problem. In each iteration, the algorithm generates a trajectory from
the starting point to the target equilibrium state with the aim of respecting
risk constraints with high probability (that encodes safe operation of the
system) and improving the cost of the trajectory as compared to previous
iterations. At the end of each iteration, the visited states and observed
samples of the uncertainty are stored and accumulated with the previous
observations. For each iteration, the states stored previously are considered
as terminal constraints of the MPC scheme, and samples obtained thus far are
used to construct distributionally robust risk constraints. As iterations
progress, more data is obtained and the environment is explored progressively
to ensure better safety and cost optimality. We prove that the MPC scheme in
each iteration is recursively feasible and the resulting trajectories converge
asymptotically to the target while ensuring safety with high probability.
<br />We identify conditions under which the cost-to-go reduces as iterations
progress. For systems with locally one-step reachable target, we specify
scenarios that ensure finite-time convergence of iterations. We provide
computationally tractable reformulations of the risk constraints for total
variation and Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity sets. A simulation example
illustrates the application of our results in finding a risk-constrained path
for two mobile robots facing an uncertain obstacle.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses a continuous-time risk-minimizing two-player zero-sum
stochastic differential game (SDG), in which each player aims to minimize its
probability of failure. Failure occurs in the event when the state of the game
enters into predefined undesirable domains, and one player's failure is the
other's success. We derive a sufficient condition for this game to have a
saddle-point equilibrium and show that it can be solved via a
Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE) with Dirichlet
boundary condition. Under certain assumptions on the system dynamics and cost
function, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the saddle-point of the
game. We provide explicit expressions for the saddle-point policies which can
be numerically evaluated using path integral control. This allows us to solve
the game online via Monte Carlo sampling of system trajectories. We implement
our control synthesis framework on two classes of risk-minimizing zero-sum
SDGs: a disturbance attenuation problem and a pursuit-evasion game. Simulation
studies are presented to validate the proposed control synthesis framework.

<p class="mathjax">AI-generated images have become increasingly realistic and have garnered
significant public attention. While synthetic images are intriguing due to
their realism, they also pose an important misinformation threat. To address
this new threat, researchers have developed multiple algorithms to detect
synthetic images and identify their source generators. However, most existing
source attribution techniques are designed to operate in a closed-set scenario,
i.e. they can only be used to discriminate between known image generators. By
contrast, new image-generation techniques are rapidly emerging. To contend with
this, there is a great need for open-set source attribution techniques that can
identify when synthetic images have originated from new, unseen generators. To
address this problem, we propose a new metric learning-based approach. Our
technique works by learning transferrable embeddings capable of discriminating
between generators, even when they are not seen during training. An image is
first assigned to a candidate generator, then is accepted or rejected based on
its distance in the embedding space from known generators' learned reference
points. Importantly, we identify that initializing our source attribution
embedding network by pretraining it on image camera identification can improve
our embeddings' transferability. Through a series of experiments, we
demonstrate our approach's ability to attribute the source of synthetic images
in open-set scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">H-score is a semi-quantitative method used to assess the presence and
distribution of proteins in tissue samples by combining the intensity of
staining and percentage of stained nuclei. It is widely used but time-consuming
and can be limited in accuracy and precision. Computer-aided methods may help
overcome these limitations and improve the efficiency of pathologists'
workflows. In this work, we developed a model EndoNet for automatic calculation
of H-score on histological slides. Our proposed method uses neural networks and
consists of two main parts. The first is a detection model which predicts
keypoints of centers of nuclei. The second is a H-score module which calculates
the value of the H-score using mean pixel values of predicted keypoints. Our
model was trained and validated on 1780 annotated tiles with a shape of 100x100
$\mu m$ and performed 0.77 mAP on a test dataset. Moreover, the model can be
adjusted to a specific specialist or whole laboratory to reproduce the manner
of calculating the H-score. Thus, EndoNet is effective and robust in the
analysis of histology slides, which can improve and significantly accelerate
the work of pathologists.

<p class="mathjax">Learning relies on coordinated synaptic changes in recurrently connected
populations of neurons. Therefore, understanding the collective evolution of
synaptic connectivity over learning is a key challenge in neuroscience and
machine learning. In particular, recent work has shown that the weight matrices
of task-trained RNNs are typically low rank, but how this low rank structure
unfolds over learning is unknown. To address this, we investigate the rank of
the 3-tensor formed by the weight matrices throughout learning. By fitting RNNs
of varying rank to large-scale neural recordings during a motor learning task,
we find that the inferred weights are low-tensor-rank and therefore evolve over
a fixed low-dimensional subspace throughout the entire course of learning. We
next validate the observation of low-tensor-rank learning on an RNN trained to
solve the same task by performing a low-tensor-rank decomposition directly on
the ground truth weights, and by showing that the method we applied to the data
faithfully recovers this low rank structure. Finally, we present a set of
mathematical results bounding the matrix and tensor ranks of gradient descent
learning dynamics which show that low-tensor-rank weights emerge naturally in
RNNs trained to solve low-dimensional tasks. Taken together, our findings
provide novel constraints on the evolution of population connectivity over
learning in both biological and artificial neural networks, and enable reverse
engineering of learning-induced changes in recurrent network dynamics from
large-scale neural recordings.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a numerical analysis of a master equation modeling the
interaction of a system with a noisy environment in the particular context of
open quantum systems. It is shown that our transformed master equation has a
reduced computational cost in comparison to a Wigner-Fokker-Planck model of the
same system for the general case of any potential. Specifics of a NIPG-DG
numerical scheme adequate for the convection-diffusion system obtained are then
presented. This will let us solve computationally the transformed system of
interest modeling our open quantum system. A benchmark problem, the case of a
harmonic potential, is then presented, for which the numerical results are
compared against the analytical steady-state solution of this problem.

<p class="mathjax">Breuer and Klivans defined a diverse class of scheduling problems in terms of
Boolean formulas with atomic clauses that are inequalities. We consider what we
call graph-like scheduling problems. These are Boolean formulas that are
conjunctions of disjunctions of atomic clauses $(x_i \neq x_j)$. These problems
generalize proper coloring in graphs and hypergraphs. We focus on the existence
of a solution with all $x_i$ taking the value of $0$ or $1$ (i.e. problems
analogous to the bipartite case). When a graph-like scheduling problem has such
a solution, we say it has property B just as is done for $2$-colorable
hypergraphs. We define the notion of a $\lambda$-uniform graph-like scheduling
problem for any integer partition $\lambda$. Some bounds are attained for the
size of the smallest $\lambda$-uniform graph-like scheduling problems without
property B. We make use of both random and constructive methods to obtain
bounds. Just as in the case of hypergraphs finding tight bounds remains an open
problem.

<p class="mathjax">Statistical and stochastic analysis based on thermodynamics has been the main
analysis framework for stochastic global optimization. Recently, appearing
quantum annealing or quantum tunneling algorithm for global optimization, we
require a new researching framework for global optimization algorithms. In this
paper, we provide the analysis for quantization-based optimization based on the
Schr\"odinger equation to reveal what property in quantum mechanics enables
global optimization. We present that the tunneling effect derived by the
Schr\"odinger equation in quantization-based optimization enables to escape of
a local minimum. Additionally, we confirm that this tunneling effect is the
same property included in quantum mechanics-based global optimization.
Experiments with standard multi-modal benchmark functions represent that the
proposed analysis is valid.
