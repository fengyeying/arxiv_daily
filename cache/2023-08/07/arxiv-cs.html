<p class="mathjax">SemCom and goal-oriented SemCom are designed to transmit only
semantically-relevant information and hence help to minimize power usage,
bandwidth consumption, and transmission delay. Consequently, SemCom and
goal-oriented SemCom embody a paradigm shift that can change the status quo
that wireless connectivity is an opaque data pipe carrying messages whose
context-dependent meaning and effectiveness have been ignored. On the other
hand, 6G is critical for the materialization of major SemCom use cases (e.g.,
machine-to-machine SemCom) and major goal-oriented SemCom use cases (e.g.,
autonomous transportation). The paradigms of \textit{6G for (goal-oriented)
SemCom} and \textit{(goal-oriented) SemCom for 6G} call for the tighter
integration and marriage of 6G, SemCom, and goal-oriented SemCom. To facilitate
this integration and marriage of 6G, SemCom, and goal-oriented SemCom, this
comprehensive tutorial-cum-survey paper first explains the fundamentals of
semantics and semantic information, semantic representation, theories of
semantic information, and definitions of semantic entropy. It then builds on
this understanding and details the state-of-the-art research landscape of
SemCom and goal-oriented SemCom in terms of their respective algorithmic,
theoretical, and realization research frontiers. This paper also exposes the
fundamental and major challenges of SemCom and goal-oriented SemCom, and
proposes novel future research directions for them in terms of their
aforementioned research frontiers. By presenting novel future research
directions for SemCom and goal-oriented SemCom along with their corresponding
fundamental and major challenges, this tutorial-cum-survey article duly
stimulates major streams of research on SemCom and goal-oriented SemCom theory,
algorithm, and implementation for 6G and beyond.

<p class="mathjax">We approached the goal of applying meta-learning to self-supervised masked
autoencoders for spatiotemporal learning in three steps. Broadly, we seek to
understand the impact of applying meta-learning to existing state-of-the-art
representation learning architectures. Thus, we test spatiotemporal learning
through: a meta-learning architecture only, a representation learning
architecture only, and an architecture applying representation learning
alongside a meta learning architecture. We utilize the Memory Augmented Neural
Network (MANN) architecture to apply meta-learning to our framework.
Specifically, we first experiment with applying a pre-trained MAE and
fine-tuning on our small-scale spatiotemporal dataset for video reconstruction
tasks. Next, we experiment with training an MAE encoder and applying a
classification head for action classification tasks. Finally, we experiment
with applying a pre-trained MAE and fine-tune with MANN backbone for action
classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud providers can greatly benefit from accurate workload prediction.
However, the workload of cloud servers is highly variable, with occasional
heavy workload bursts. This makes workload prediction challenging.
<br />There are mainly two categories of workload prediction methods: statistical
methods and neural-network-based ones. The former ones rely on strong
mathematical assumptions and have reported low accuracy when predicting highly
variable workload. The latter ones offer higher overall accuracy, yet they are
vulnerable to data imbalance between heavy workload and common one. This
impairs the prediction accuracy of neural network-based models on heavy
workload.
<br />Either the overall inaccuracy of statistic methods or the heavy-workload
inaccuracy of neural-network-based models can cause service level agreement
violations.
<br />Thus, we propose PePNet to improve overall especially heavy workload
prediction accuracy. It has two distinctive characteristics:
<br />(i) A Periodicity-Perceived Mechanism to detect the existence of periodicity
and the length of one period automatically, without any priori knowledge.
Furthermore, it fuses periodic information adaptively, which is suitable for
periodic, lax periodic and aperiodic time series.
<br />(ii) An Achilles' Heel Loss Function iteratively optimizing the most
under-fitting part in predicting sequence for each step, which significantly
improves the prediction accuracy of heavy load.
<br />Extensive experiments conducted on Alibaba2018, SMD dataset and Dinda's
dataset demonstrate that PePNet improves MAPE for overall workload by 20.0% on
average, compared with state-of-the-art methods. Especially, PePNet improves
MAPE for heavy workload by 23.9% on average.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion recognition is an important research direction in artificial
intelligence, helping machines understand and adapt to human emotional states.
Multimodal electrophysiological(ME) signals, such as EEG, GSR,
respiration(Resp), and temperature(Temp), are effective biomarkers for
reflecting changes in human emotions. However, using electrophysiological
signals for emotion recognition faces challenges such as data scarcity,
inconsistent labeling, and difficulty in cross-individual generalization. To
address these issues, we propose ME-MHACL, a self-supervised contrastive
learning-based multimodal emotion recognition method that can learn meaningful
feature representations from unlabeled electrophysiological signals and use
multi-head attention mechanisms for feature fusion to improve recognition
performance. Our method includes two stages: first, we use the Meiosis method
to group sample and augment unlabeled electrophysiological signals and design a
self-supervised contrastive learning task; second, we apply the trained feature
extractor to labeled electrophysiological signals and use multi-head attention
mechanisms for feature fusion. We conducted experiments on two public datasets,
DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI, and our method outperformed existing benchmark methods in
emotion recognition tasks and had good cross-individual generalization ability.

<p class="mathjax">Existing research mostly improves the fairness of Machine Learning (ML)
software regarding a single protected attribute at a time, but this is
unrealistic given that many users have multiple protected attributes. This
paper conducts an extensive study of fairness improvement regarding multiple
protected attributes, covering 11 state-of-the-art fairness improvement
methods. We analyze the effectiveness of these methods with different datasets,
metrics, and ML models when considering multiple protected attributes. The
results reveal that improving fairness for a single protected attribute can
largely decrease fairness regarding unconsidered protected attributes. This
decrease is observed in up to 88.3% of scenarios (57.5% on average). More
surprisingly, we find little difference in accuracy loss when considering
single and multiple protected attributes, indicating that accuracy can be
maintained in the multiple-attribute paradigm. However, the effect on precision
and recall when handling multiple protected attributes is about 5 times and 8
times that of a single attribute. This has important implications for future
fairness research: reporting only accuracy as the ML performance metric, which
is currently common in the literature, is inadequate.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the proliferation of Blockchain Metaverse projects, the inclusion of
physically disabled individuals in the Metaverse remains distant, with limited
standards and regulations in place. However, the article proposes a concept of
the Metaverse that leverages emerging technologies, such as Virtual and
Augmented Reality, and the Internet of Things, to enable greater engagement of
disabled creatives. This approach aims to enhance inclusiveness in the
Metaverse landscape. Based on the findings, the paper concludes that the active
involvement of physically disabled individuals in the design and development of
Metaverse platforms is crucial for promoting inclusivity. The proposed
framework for accessibility and inclusiveness in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed
realities of decentralised Metaverses provides a basis for the meaningful
participation of disabled creatives. The article emphasises the importance of
addressing the mechanisms for art production by individuals with disabilities
in the emerging Metaverse landscape. Additionally, it highlights the need for
further research and collaboration to establish standards and regulations that
facilitate the inclusion of physically disabled individuals in Metaverse
projects.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the capability of correctly recovering well-separated
clusters by various brands of the $k$-means algorithm. The concept of
well-separatedness used here is derived directly from the common definition of
clusters, which imposes an interplay between the requirements of
within-cluster-homogenicity and between-clusters-diversity. Conditions are
derived for a special case of well-separated clusters such that the global
minimum of $k$-means cost function coincides with the well-separatedness. An
experimental investigation is performed to find out whether or no various
brands of $k$-means are actually capable of discovering well separated
clusters. It turns out that they are not. A new algorithm is proposed that is a
variation of $k$-means++ via repeated {sub}sampling when choosing a seed. The
new algorithm outperforms four other algorithms from $k$-means family on the
task.

<p class="mathjax">Entity Matching (EM), which aims to identify all entity pairs referring to
the same real-world entity from relational tables, is one of the most important
tasks in real-world data management systems. Due to the labeling process of EM
being extremely labor-intensive, unsupervised EM is more applicable than
supervised EM in practical scenarios. Traditional unsupervised EM assumes that
all entities come from two tables; however, it is more common to match entities
from multiple tables in practical applications, that is, multi-table entity
matching (multi-table EM). Unfortunately, effective and efficient unsupervised
multi-table EM remains under-explored. To fill this gap, this paper formally
studies the problem of unsupervised multi-table entity matching and proposes an
effective and efficient solution, termed as MultiEM. MultiEM is a parallelable
pipeline of enhanced entity representation, table-wise hierarchical merging,
and density-based pruning. Extensive experimental results on six real-world
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MultiEM in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately predicting anesthetic effects is essential for target-controlled
infusion systems. The traditional (PK-PD) models for Bispectral index (BIS)
prediction require manual selection of model parameters, which can be
challenging in clinical settings. Recently proposed deep learning methods can
only capture general trends and may not predict abrupt changes in BIS. To
address these issues, we propose a transformer-based method for predicting the
depth of anesthesia (DOA) using drug infusions of propofol and remifentanil.
Our method employs long short-term memory (LSTM) and gate residual network
(GRN) networks to improve the efficiency of feature fusion and applies an
attention mechanism to discover the interactions between the drugs. We also use
label distribution smoothing and reweighting losses to address data imbalance.
Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms traditional
PK-PD models and previous deep learning methods, effectively predicting
anesthetic depth under sudden and deep anesthesia conditions.

Diabetic patients using the PPG signal and metadata for training Logistic
Regression (LR) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. We used PPG
signals from a publicly available dataset. To prevent overfitting, we divided
the data into five folds for cross-validation. By ensuring that patients in the
training set are not in the testing set, the model's performance can be
evaluated on unseen subjects' data, providing a more accurate assessment of its
generalization. Our model achieved an F1-Score and AUC of $58.8\pm20.0\%$ and
$79.2\pm15.0\%$ for LR and $51.7\pm16.5\%$ and $73.6\pm17.0\%$ for XGBoost,
respectively. Feature analysis suggested that PPG morphological features
contains diabetes-related information alongside metadata. Our findings are
within the same range reported in the literature, indicating that machine
learning methods are promising for developing remote, non-invasive, and
continuous measurement devices for detecting and preventing diabetes.

<p class="mathjax">The RET (Requirements Engineering and Testing) workshop series provides a
meeting point for researchers and practitioners from the two separate fields of
Requirements Engineering (RE) and Testing. The goal is to improve the
connection and alignment of these two areas through an exchange of ideas,
challenges, practices, experiences and results. The long term aim is to build a
community and a body of knowledge within the intersection of RE and Testing,
i.e. RET. The 2nd workshop was held in co-location with ICSE 2015 in Florence,
Italy. The workshop continued in the same interactive vein as the 1st one and
included a keynote, paper presentations with ample time for discussions, and a
group exercise. For true impact and relevance this cross-cutting area requires
contribution from both RE and Testing, and from both researchers and
practitioners. A range of papers were presented from short experience papers to
full research papers that cover connections between the two fields. One of the
main outputs of the 2nd workshop was a categorization of the presented workshop
papers according to an initial definition of the area of RET which identifies
the aspects RE, Testing and coordination effect.

<p class="mathjax">A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to use a familiar domain to make
inferences about a less familiar domain, known as analogical reasoning. In this
article, we delve into the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
dealing with progressively complex analogies expressed in unstructured text. We
discuss analogies at four distinct levels of complexity: lexical analogies,
syntactic analogies, semantic analogies, and pragmatic analogies. As the
analogies become more complex, they require increasingly extensive, diverse
knowledge beyond the textual content, unlikely to be found in the lexical
co-occurrence statistics that power LLMs. To address this, we discuss the
necessity of employing Neuro-symbolic AI techniques that combine statistical
and symbolic AI, informing the representation of unstructured text to highlight
and augment relevant content, provide abstraction and guide the mapping
process. Our knowledge-informed approach maintains the efficiency of LLMs while
preserving the ability to explain analogies for pedagogical applications.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Compartmentalized Diffusion Models (CDM), a method to train
different diffusion models (or prompts) on distinct data sources and
arbitrarily compose them at inference time. The individual models can be
trained in isolation, at different times, and on different distributions and
domains and can be later composed to achieve performance comparable to a
paragon model trained on all data simultaneously. Furthermore, each model only
contains information about the subset of the data it was exposed to during
training, enabling several forms of training data protection. In particular,
CDMs are the first method to enable both selective forgetting and continual
learning for large-scale diffusion models, as well as allowing serving
customized models based on the user's access rights. CDMs also allow
determining the importance of a subset of the data in generating particular
samples.

<p class="mathjax">Static meshes with texture map are widely used in modern industrial and
manufacturing sectors, attracting considerable attention in the mesh
compression community due to its huge amount of data. To facilitate the study
of static mesh compression algorithm and objective quality metric, we create
the Tencent - Static Mesh Dataset (TSMD) containing 42 reference meshes with
rich visual characteristics. 210 distorted samples are generated by the lossy
compression scheme developed for the Call for Proposals on polygonal static
mesh coding, released on June 23 by the Alliance for Open Media Volumetric
Visual Media group. Using processed video sequences, a large-scale,
crowdsourcing-based, subjective experiment was conducted to collect subjective
scores from 74 viewers. The dataset undergoes analysis to validate its sample
diversity and Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) accuracy, establishing its
heterogeneous nature and reliability. State-of-the-art objective metrics are
evaluated on the new dataset. Pearson and Spearman correlations around 0.75 are
reported, deviating from results typically observed on less heterogeneous
datasets, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust
metrics. The TSMD, including meshes, PVSs, bitstreams, and MOS, is made
publicly available at the following location:

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformers (ViT) usually extract features via forwarding all the
tokens in the self-attention layers from top to toe. In this paper, we
introduce dynamic token-pass vision transformers (DoViT) for semantic
segmentation, which can adaptively reduce the inference cost for images with
different complexity. DoViT gradually stops partial easy tokens from
self-attention calculation and keeps the hard tokens forwarding until meeting
the stopping criteria. We employ lightweight auxiliary heads to make the
token-pass decision and divide the tokens into keeping/stopping parts. With a
token separate calculation, the self-attention layers are speeded up with
sparse tokens and still work friendly with hardware. A token reconstruction
module is built to collect and reset the grouped tokens to their original
position in the sequence, which is necessary to predict correct semantic masks.
We conduct extensive experiments on two common semantic segmentation tasks, and
demonstrate that our method greatly reduces about 40% $\sim$ 60% FLOPs and the
drop of mIoU is within 0.8% for various segmentation transformers. The
throughput and inference speed of ViT-L/B are increased to more than 2$\times$
on Cityscapes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an experimental study on the application of quaternions
in several machine learning algorithms. Quaternion is a mathematical
representation of rotation in three-dimensional space, which can be used to
represent complex data transformations. In this study, we explore the use of
quaternions to represent and classify rotation data, using randomly generated
quaternion data and corresponding labels, converting quaternions to rotation
matrices, and using them as input features. Based on quaternions and multiple
machine learning algorithms, it has shown higher accuracy and significantly
improved performance in prediction tasks. Overall, this study provides an
empirical basis for exploiting quaternions for machine learning tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Different from the current node-level anomaly detection task, the goal of
graph-level anomaly detection is to find abnormal graphs that significantly
differ from others in a graph set. Due to the scarcity of research on the work
of graph-level anomaly detection, the detailed description of graph-level
anomaly is insufficient. Furthermore, existing works focus on capturing
anomalous graph information to learn better graph representations, but they
ignore the importance of an effective anomaly score function for evaluating
abnormal graphs. Thus, in this work, we first define anomalous graph
information including node and graph property anomalies in a graph set and
adopt node-level and graph-level information differences to identify them,
respectively. Then, we introduce a discriminative graph-level anomaly detection
framework with dual-students-teacher model, where the teacher model with a
heuristic loss are trained to make graph representations more divergent. Then,
two competing student models trained by normal and abnormal graphs respectively
fit graph representations of the teacher model in terms of node-level and
graph-level representation perspectives. Finally, we combine representation
errors between two student models to discriminatively distinguish anomalous
graphs. Extensive experiment analysis demonstrates that our method is effective
for the graph-level anomaly detection task on graph datasets in the real world.

<p class="mathjax">The embedding spaces of image models have been shown to encode a range of
social biases such as racism and sexism. Here, we investigate specific factors
that contribute to the emergence of these biases in Vision Transformers (ViT).
Therefore, we measure the impact of training data, model architecture, and
training objectives on social biases in the learned representations of ViTs.
Our findings indicate that counterfactual augmentation training using
diffusion-based image editing can mitigate biases, but does not eliminate them.
Moreover, we find that larger models are less biased than smaller models, and
that models trained using discriminative objectives are less biased than those
trained using generative objectives. In addition, we observe inconsistencies in
the learned social biases. To our surprise, ViTs can exhibit opposite biases
when trained on the same data set using different self-supervised objectives.
Our findings give insights into the factors that contribute to the emergence of
social biases and suggests that we could achieve substantial fairness
improvements based on model design choices.

<p class="mathjax">Research on adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) extends back to at least
the 1960s, and many ATSC methods have been proposed over the years. This paper
provides a review of this research and proposes a taxonomy for organizing it,
accompanied by a consistent vocabulary for discussing the control concepts. We
begin from the well-established concept of control generations. Next, we
classify the ATSC methods according to their topographic structure (local-only,
system/hierarchical), time resolution of decision-making (continuous versus
planning-horizon), type of decision (rule-based or optimization), objective
function, cyclic/acyclic nature,and additional subcategories relevant to
certain "families" of methods. These various elements of system control are
organized into a taxonomy of ATSC to help future researchers understand the
wide diversity of algorithmic approaches to the signal control problem that
have been proposed to date, and which can be updated or expanded to incorporate
future research.

<p class="mathjax">Flamelet models are widely used in computational fluid dynamics to simulate
thermochemical processes in turbulent combustion. These models typically employ
memory-expensive lookup tables that are predetermined and represent the
combustion process to be simulated. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) offer a
deep learning approach that can store this tabular data using a small number of
network weights, potentially reducing the memory demands of complex simulations
by orders of magnitude. However, ANNs with standard training losses often
struggle with underrepresented targets in multivariate regression tasks, e.g.,
when learning minor species mass fractions as part of lookup tables. This paper
seeks to improve the accuracy of an ANN when learning multiple species mass
fractions of a hydrogen (\ce{H2}) combustion lookup table. We assess a simple,
yet effective loss weight adjustment that outperforms the standard mean-squared
error optimization and enables accurate learning of all species mass fractions,
even of minor species where the standard optimization completely fails.
Furthermore, we find that the loss weight adjustment leads to more balanced
gradients in the network training, which explains its effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Conversational engagement estimation is posed as a regression problem,
entailing the identification of the favorable attention and involvement of the
participants in the conversation. This task arises as a crucial pursuit to gain
insights into human's interaction dynamics and behavior patterns within a
conversation. In this research, we introduce a dilated convolutional
Transformer for modeling and estimating human engagement in the MULTIMEDIATE
2023 competition. Our proposed system surpasses the baseline models, exhibiting
a noteworthy $7$\% improvement on test set and $4$\% on validation set.
Moreover, we employ different modality fusion mechanism and show that for this
type of data, a simple concatenated method with self-attention fusion gains the

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel bottom-up approach for the extraction of chart data. Our
model utilizes images of charts as inputs and learns to detect keypoints (KP),
which are used to reconstruct the components within the plot area. Our novelty
lies in detecting a fusion of continuous and discrete KP as predicted heatmaps.
A combination of sparse and dense per-pixel objectives coupled with a uni-modal
self-attention-based feature-fusion layer is applied to learn KP embeddings.
Further leveraging deep metric learning for unsupervised clustering, allows us
to segment the chart plot area into various objects. By further matching the
chart components to the legend, we are able to obtain the data series names. A
post-processing threshold is applied to the KP embeddings to refine the object
reconstructions and improve accuracy. Our extensive experiments include an
evaluation of different modules for KP estimation and the combination of deep
layer aggregation and corner pooling approaches. The results of our experiments
provide extensive evaluation for the task of real-world chart data extraction.

<p class="mathjax">Typographical errors are a major source of frustration for visitors of online
marketplaces. Because of the domain-specific nature of these marketplaces and
the very short queries users tend to search for, traditional spell cheking
solutions do not perform well in correcting typos. We present a data
augmentation method to address the lack of annotated typo data and train a
recurrent neural network to learn context-limited domain-specific embeddings.
Those embeddings are deployed in a real-time inferencing API for the Microsoft
AppSource marketplace to find the closest match between a misspelled user query
and the available product names. Our data efficient solution shows that
controlled high quality synthetic data may be a powerful tool especially
considering the current climate of large language models which rely on
prohibitively huge and often uncontrolled datasets.

such as MATLAB/Simulink are limited despite the tools' importance in various
industries.
<br />Aims: The aim of this paper is to investigate the reproducibility of previous
empirical studies that used Simulink model corpora and to evaluate the
generalizability of their results to a newer and larger corpus, including a
comparison with proprietary models.
<br />Method: The study reviews methodologies and data sources employed in prior
Simulink model studies and replicates the previous analysis using SLNET. In
addition, we propose a heuristic for determining code-generating Simulink
models and assess the open-source models' similarity to proprietary models.
<br />Results: Our analysis of SLNET confirms and contradicts earlier findings and
highlights its potential as a valuable resource for model-based development
research. We found that open-source Simulink models follow good modeling
practices and contain models comparable in size and properties to proprietary
models. We also collected and distribute 208 git repositories with over 9k
commits, facilitating studies on model evolution.
<br />Conclusions: The replication study offers actionable insights and lessons
learned from the reproduction process, including valuable information on the
generalizability of research findings based on earlier open-source corpora to
the newer and larger SLNET corpus. The study sheds light on noteworthy
attributes of SLNET, which is self-contained and redistributable.

to address the challenges faced in comprehending and extracting data from chart
visualizations within documents. Despite efforts to tackle this problem using
synthetic charts, solutions are limited by the shortage of annotated real-world

QA on real-world charts, offering a systematic analysis of the task and a novel
taxonomy for template-based chart question creation. Our contribution includes
the introduction of a new answer type, 'list', with both ranked and unranked
variations. Our study is conducted on a real-world chart dataset from
scientific literature, showcasing higher visual complexity compared to other
works. Our focus is on template-based QA and how it can serve as a standard for
evaluating the first-order logic capabilities of models. The results of our
experiments, conducted on a real-world out-of-distribution dataset, provide a
robust evaluation of large-scale pre-trained models and advance the field of
chart visual QA and formal logic verification for neural networks in general.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of distribution networks is to meet their local area power demand
with maximum reliability. As the electricity consumption tends to increase
every year, limited line thermal capacity can lead to network congestion.
Continuous development and upgradation of the distribution network is thus
required to meet the energy demand, which poses a significant increase in cost.
The objective of this research is to analyze distribution network topologies
and introduce a topology reconfiguration scheme based on the cost and demand of
electricity. Traditional electrical distribution networks are static and
inefficient. To make the network active, an optimal dynamic network topology
reconfiguration (DNTR) is proposed to control line switching and reconnect some
loads to different substations such that the cost of electricity can be
minimized. The proposed DNTR strategy was tested on a synthetic radial
distribution network with three substations each connecting to an IEEE 13-bus
system. Simulation results demonstrated significant cost saving in daily
operations of this distribution system.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of fake reviews on various online platforms has created a
major concern for both consumers and businesses. Such reviews can deceive
customers and cause damage to the reputation of products or services, making it
crucial to identify them. Although the detection of fake reviews has been
extensively studied in English language, detecting fake reviews in non-English
languages such as Bengali is still a relatively unexplored research area. This
paper introduces the Bengali Fake Review Detection (BFRD) dataset, the first
publicly available dataset for identifying fake reviews in Bengali. The dataset
consists of 7710 non-fake and 1339 fake food-related reviews collected from
social media posts. To convert non-Bengali words in a review, a unique pipeline
has been proposed that translates English words to their corresponding Bengali
meaning and also back transliterates Romanized Bengali to Bengali. We have
conducted rigorous experimentation using multiple deep learning and pre-trained
transformer language models to develop a reliable detection system. Finally, we
propose a weighted ensemble model that combines four pre-trained transformers:
BanglaBERT, BanglaBERT Base, BanglaBERT Large, and BanglaBERT Generator .
According to the experiment results, the proposed ensemble model obtained a
weighted F1-score of 0.9843 on 13390 reviews, including 1339 actual fake
reviews and 5356 augmented fake reviews generated with the nlpaug library. The
remaining 6695 reviews were randomly selected from the 7710 non-fake instances.
The model achieved a 0.9558 weighted F1-score when the fake reviews were
augmented using the bnaug library.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have found widespread applications in various
domains, including web applications, where they facilitate human interaction
via chatbots with natural language interfaces. Internally, aided by an
LLM-integration middleware such as Langchain, user prompts are translated into
SQL queries used by the LLM to provide meaningful responses to users. However,
unsanitized user prompts can lead to SQL injection attacks, potentially
compromising the security of the database. Despite the growing interest in
prompt injection vulnerabilities targeting LLMs, the specific risks of
generating SQL injection attacks through prompt injections have not been
extensively studied. In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of
prompt-to-SQL (P$_2$SQL) injections targeting web applications based on the
Langchain framework. Using Langchain as our case study, we characterize
P$_2$SQL injections, exploring their variants and impact on application
security through multiple concrete examples. Furthermore, we evaluate 7
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating the pervasiveness of P$_2$SQL attacks
across language models. Our findings indicate that LLM-integrated applications
based on Langchain are highly susceptible to P$_2$SQL injection attacks,
warranting the adoption of robust defenses. To counter these attacks, we
propose four effective defense techniques that can be integrated as extensions
to the Langchain framework. We validate the defenses through an experimental
evaluation with a real-world use case application.

<p class="mathjax">Bridging the huge disparity between neural and symbolic representation can
potentially enable the incorporation of symbolic thinking into neural networks
from essence. Motivated by how human gradually builds complex symbolic
representation from the prototype symbols that are learned through perception
and environmental interactions. We propose a Neural-Symbolic Transitional
Dictionary Learning (TDL) framework that employs an EM algorithm to learn a
transitional representation of data that compresses high-dimension information
of visual parts of an input into a set of tensors as neural variables and
discover the implicit predicate structure in a self-supervised way. We
implement the framework with a diffusion model by regarding the decomposition
of input as a cooperative game, then learn predicates by prototype clustering.
We additionally use RL enabled by the Markovian of diffusion models to further
tune the learned prototypes by incorporating subjective factors. Extensive
experiments on 3 abstract compositional visual objects datasets that require
the model to segment parts without any visual features like texture, color, or
shadows apart from shape and 3 neural/symbolic downstream tasks demonstrate the
learned representation enables interpretable decomposition of visual input and
smooth adaption to downstream tasks which are not available by existing
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Determining the memory capacity of two-layer neural networks with m hidden
neurons and input dimension d (i.e., md+m total trainable parameters), which
refers to the largest size of general data the network can memorize, is a
fundamental machine-learning question. For non-polynomial real analytic
activation functions, such as sigmoids and smoothed rectified linear units
(smoothed ReLUs), we establish a lower bound of md/2 and optimality up to a
factor of approximately 2. Analogous prior results were limited to Heaviside
and ReLU activations, with results for smooth activations suffering from
logarithmic factors and requiring random data. To analyze the memory capacity,
we examine the rank of the network's Jacobian by computing the rank of matrices
involving both Hadamard powers and the Khati-Rao product. Our computation
extends classical linear algebraic facts about the rank of Hadamard powers.
Overall, our approach differs from previous works on memory capacity and holds
promise for extending to deeper models and other architectures.

discretizations of the curl-curl problem. This estimator relies on a
Prager--Synge inequality, and therefore leads to fully guaranteed constant-free
upper bounds on the error. The estimator is also locally efficient and
polynomial-degree-robust. The construction is based on patch-wise
divergence-constrained minimization problems, leading to a cheap embarrassingly
parallel algorithm. Crucially, the estimator operates without any assumption on
the topology of the domain, and unconventional arguments are required to
establish the reliability estimate. Numerical examples illustrate the key
theoretical results, and suggest that the estimator is suited for mesh

<p class="mathjax">Social media platforms provide a rich environment for analyzing user
behavior. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been a mainstream approach
for social media analysis models involving complex patterns. However, these
methods are susceptible to biases in the training data, such as participation
inequality. Basically, a mere 1% of users generate the majority of the content
on social networking sites, while the remaining users, though engaged to
varying degrees, tend to be less active in content creation and largely silent.
These silent users consume and listen to information that is propagated on the
platform. However, their voice, attitude, and interests are not reflected in
the online content, making the decision of the current methods predisposed
towards the opinion of the active users. So models can mistake the loudest
users for the majority. We propose to leverage re-weighting techniques to make
the silent majority heard, and in turn, investigate whether the cues from these
users can improve the performance of the current models for the downstream task
of fake news detection.

Learning (SSL) and FL together to learn representations for Automatic Speech
Recognition respecting data privacy constraints. We use the speaker and chapter
information in the unlabeled speech dataset, Libri-Light, to simulate non-IID
speaker-siloed data distributions and pre-train an LSTM encoder with the
Contrastive Predictive Coding framework with FedSGD. We show that the
pre-trained ASR encoder in FL performs as well as a centrally pre-trained model
and produces an improvement of 12-15% (WER) compared to no pre-training. We
further adapt the federated pre-trained models to a new language, French, and
show a 20% (WER) improvement over no pre-training.

<p class="mathjax">Reasoning about the sensitivity of functions with respect to their inputs has
interesting applications in various areas, such as differential privacy. In
order to check and enforce sensitivity, several approaches have been developed,
notably sensitivity type systems. In these systems, sensitivity can be seen as
an effect in the sense of type-and-effects systems as originally proposed by
Gifford and Lucassen. Because type-and-effect systems can make certain useful
programming patterns tedious or overly conservative, there is value in bringing
the benefits of gradual typing to these disciplines in order to ease their
adoption. In this work, we motivate, formalize, and prototype gradual
sensitivity typing. The language GSoul supports both the unrestricted unknown
sensitivity and bounded imprecision in the form of intervals. Gradual
sensitivity typing allows programmers to smoothly evolve typed programs without
any static sensitivity information towards hardened programs with a mix of
static and dynamic sensitivity checking. In particular, we show that gradual
sensitivity supports recursive functions for which fully static checking would
be overly conservative, seamlessly enabling exact runtime sensitivity checks.
GSoul satisfies both the gradual guarantees and sensitivity type soundness,
known as metric preservation. We establish that, in general, gradual metric
preservation is termination insensitive, and that one can achieve
termination-sensitive gradual metric preservation by hardening specifications
to bounded imprecision. We implement a prototype that provides an interactive
test bed for gradual sensitivity typing. This work opens the door to
gradualizing other typing disciplines that rely on function sensitivity such as
differential privacy, as well as other quantitative type-based reasoning
techniques.

whose goal was to improve the sample efficiency of language models. We trained
an ensemble consisting of a GPT-2 and small LLaMA models on the
developmentally-plausible, 10M-word BabyLM dataset, then distilled it into a
small, 58M-parameter LLaMA model, which exceeds in performance both of its
teachers as well as a similar model trained without distillation. This suggests
that distillation can not only retain the full performance of the teacher model
when the latter is trained on a sufficiently small dataset; it can exceed it,
and lead to significantly better performance than direct training.

<p class="mathjax">While reaching for NLP systems that maximize accuracy, other important
metrics of system performance are often overlooked. Prior models are easily
forgotten despite their possible suitability in settings where large computing
resources are unavailable or relatively more costly. In this paper, we perform
a broad comparative evaluation of document-level sentiment analysis models with
a focus on resource costs that are important for the feasibility of model
deployment and general climate consciousness. Our experiments consider
different feature extraction techniques, the effect of ensembling,
task-specific deep learning modeling, and domain-independent large language
models (LLMs). We find that while a fine-tuned LLM achieves the best accuracy,
some alternate configurations provide huge (up to 24, 283 *) resource savings
for a marginal (&lt;1%) loss in accuracy. Furthermore, we find that for smaller
datasets, the differences in accuracy shrink while the difference in resource
consumption grows further.

<p class="mathjax">Progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the past decade
has been driven by the ability to train larger deep neural networks (DNNs),
leading to a compute demand that far exceeds the growth in hardware performance
afforded by Moore's law. Training DNNs is an extremely memory-intensive
process, requiring not just the model weights but also activations and
gradients for an entire minibatch to be stored. The need to provide
high-density and low-leakage on-chip memory motivates the exploration of
emerging non-volatile memory for training accelerators. Spin-Transfer-Torque
MRAM (STT-MRAM) offers several desirable properties for training accelerators,
including 3-4x higher density than SRAM, significantly reduced leakage power,
high endurance and reasonable access time. On the one hand, MRAM write
operations require high write energy and latency due to the need to ensure
reliable switching.
<br />In this study, we perform a comprehensive device-to-system evaluation and
co-optimization of STT-MRAM for efficient ML training accelerator design. We
devised a cross-layer simulation framework to evaluate the effectiveness of
STT-MRAM as a scratchpad replacing SRAM in a systolic-array-based DNN
accelerator. To address the inefficiency of writes in STT-MRAM, we propose to
reduce write voltage and duration. To evaluate the ensuing accuracy-efficiency
trade-off, we conduct a thorough analysis of the error tolerance of input
activations, weights, and errors during the training. We propose heterogeneous
memory configurations that enable training convergence with good accuracy. We
show that MRAM provide up to 15-22x improvement in system level energy across a
suite of DNN benchmarks under iso-capacity and iso-area scenarios. Further
optimizing STT-MRAM write operations can provide over 2x improvement in write
energy for minimal degradation in application-level training accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">This paper undertakes a systematic review of relevant extant literature to
consider the potential societal implications of the growth of AI in
manufacturing. We analyze the extensive range of AI applications in this
domain, such as interfirm logistics coordination, firm procurement management,
predictive maintenance, and shop-floor monitoring and control of processes,
machinery, and workers. Additionally, we explore the uncertain societal
implications of industrial AI, including its impact on the workforce, job
upskilling and deskilling, cybersecurity vulnerability, and environmental
consequences. After building a typology of AI applications in manufacturing, we
highlight the diverse possibilities for AI's implementation at different scales
and application types. We discuss the importance of considering AI's
implications both for individual firms and for society at large, encompassing
economic prosperity, equity, environmental health, and community safety and
security. The study finds that there is a predominantly optimistic outlook in
prior literature regarding AI's impact on firms, but that there is substantial
debate and contention about adverse effects and the nature of AI's societal
implications. The paper draws analogies to historical cases and other examples
to provide a contextual perspective on potential societal effects of industrial
AI. Ultimately, beneficial integration of AI in manufacturing will depend on
the choices and priorities of various stakeholders, including firms and their
managers and owners, technology developers, civil society organizations, and
governments. A broad and balanced awareness of opportunities and risks among
stakeholders is vital not only for successful and safe technical implementation
but also to construct a socially beneficial and sustainable future for
manufacturing in the age of AI.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of ranking pre-trained models for object
detection and image classification. Selecting the best pre-trained model by
fine-tuning is an expensive and time-consuming task. Previous works have
proposed transferability estimation based on features extracted by the
pre-trained models. We argue that quantifying whether the target dataset is
in-distribution (IND) or out-of-distribution (OOD) for the pre-trained model is
an important factor in the transferability estimation. To this end, we propose
ETran, an energy-based transferability assessment metric, which includes three
scores: 1) energy score, 2) classification score, and 3) regression score. We
use energy-based models to determine whether the target dataset is OOD or IND
for the pre-trained model. In contrast to the prior works, ETran is applicable
to a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and object
detection (classification+regression). This is the first work that proposes
transferability estimation for object detection task. Our extensive experiments
on four benchmarks and two tasks show that ETran outperforms previous works on
object detection and classification benchmarks by an average of 21% and 12%,
respectively, and achieves SOTA in transferability assessment.

<p class="mathjax">Thalassemia is a heritable blood disorder which is the outcome of a genetic
defect causing lack of production of hemoglobin polypeptide chains. However,
there is less understanding of the precise frequency as well as sharing in
these areas. Knowing about the frequency of thalassemia occurrence and
dependable mutations is thus a significant step in preventing, controlling, and
treatment planning. Here, Political Tangent Search Optimizer based Transfer
Learning (PTSO_TL) is introduced for thalassemia detection. Initially, input
data obtained from a particular dataset is normalized in the data normalization
stage. Quantile normalization is utilized in the data normalization stage, and
the data are then passed to the feature fusion phase, in which Weighted
Euclidean Distance with Deep Maxout Network (DMN) is utilized. Thereafter, data
augmentation is performed using the oversampling method to increase data
dimensionality. Lastly, thalassemia detection is carried out by TL, wherein a
convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized with hyperparameters from a
trained model such as Xception. TL is tuned by PTSO, and the training algorithm
PTSO is presented by merging of Political Optimizer (PO) and Tangent Search
Algorithm (TSA). Furthermore, PTSO_TL obtained maximal precision, recall, and
f-measure values of about 94.3%, 96.1%, and 95.2%, respectively.

has had a profound impact on society, raising concerns about its implications
and ethical considerations. The emergence of text generative AI tools like
ChatGPT has further intensified concerns regarding ethics, security, privacy,
and copyright. This study aims to examine the perceptions of individuals in
different information flow categorizations toward AI. The results reveal key
themes in participant-supplied definitions of AI and the fourth industrial
revolution, emphasizing the replication of human intelligence, machine
learning, automation, and the integration of digital technologies. Participants
expressed concerns about job replacement, privacy invasion, and inaccurate
information provided by AI. However, they also recognized the benefits of AI,
such as solving complex problems and increasing convenience. Views on
government involvement in shaping the fourth industrial revolution varied, with
some advocating for strict regulations and others favoring support and
development. The anticipated changes brought by the fourth industrial
revolution include automation, potential job impacts, increased social
disconnect, and reliance on technology. Understanding these perceptions is
crucial for effectively managing the challenges and opportunities associated
with AI in the evolving digital landscape.

<p class="mathjax">Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging and quickly
advancing field that combines the subsymbolic strengths of (deep) neural
networks and explicit, symbolic knowledge contained in knowledge graphs to
enhance explainability and safety in AI systems. This approach addresses a key
criticism of current generation systems, namely their inability to generate
human-understandable explanations for their outcomes and ensure safe behaviors,
especially in scenarios with \textit{unknown unknowns} (e.g. cybersecurity,
privacy). The integration of neural networks, which excel at exploring complex
data spaces, and symbolic knowledge graphs, which represent domain knowledge,
allows AI systems to reason, learn, and generalize in a manner understandable
to experts. This article describes how applications in cybersecurity and
privacy, two most demanding domains in terms of the need for AI to be
explainable while being highly accurate in complex environments, can benefit
from Neuro-Symbolic AI.

<p class="mathjax">We present our work on electric bicycles (e-bikes) and their implications for
policymakers in the United States. E-bikes have gained significant popularity
as a fast and eco-friendly transportation option. As we strive for a
sustainable energy plan, understanding the growth and impact of e-bikes is
crucial for policymakers. Our mathematical modeling offers insights into the
value of e-bikes and their role in the future. Using an ARIMA model, a
supervised machine-learning algorithm, we predicted the growth of e-bike sales
in the U.S. Our model, trained on historical sales data from January 2006 to
December 2022, projected sales of 1.3 million units in 2025 and 2.113 million
units in 2028. To assess the factors contributing to e-bike usage, we employed
a Random Forest regression model. The most significant factors influencing
e-bike sales growth were disposable personal income and popularity.
Furthermore, we examined the environmental and health impacts of e-bikes.
Through Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated the reduction in carbon emissions
due to e-bike use and the calories burned through e-biking. Our findings
revealed that e-bike usage in the U.S. resulted in a reduction of 15,737.82
kilograms of CO2 emissions in 2022. Additionally, e-bike users burned
approximately 716,630.727 kilocalories through their activities in the same
year. Our research provides valuable insights for policymakers, emphasizing the
potential of e-bikes as a sustainable transportation solution. By understanding
the growth factors and quantifying the environmental and health benefits,
policymakers can make informed decisions about integrating e-bikes into future
energy and transportation strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Anticipation is a fundamental human cognitive ability that involves thinking
about and living towards the future. While language markers reflect
anticipatory thinking, research on anticipation from the perspective of natural
language processing is limited. This study aims to investigate the futures
projected by futurists on Twitter and explore the impact of language cues on
anticipatory thinking among social media users. We address the research
questions of what futures Twitter's futurists anticipate and share, and how
these anticipated futures can be modeled from social data. To investigate this,
we review related works on anticipation, discuss the influence of language
markers and prestigious individuals on anticipatory thinking, and present a
taxonomy system categorizing futures into "present futures" and "future
present". This research presents a compiled dataset of over 1 million publicly
shared tweets by future influencers and develops a scalable NLP pipeline using
SOTA models. The study identifies 15 topics from the LDA approach and 100
distinct topics from the BERTopic approach within the futurists' tweets. These
findings contribute to the research on topic modelling and provide insights
into the futures anticipated by Twitter's futurists. The research demonstrates
the futurists' language cues signals futures-in-the-making that enhance social
media users to anticipate their own scenarios and respond to them in present.
The fully open-sourced dataset, interactive analysis, and reproducible source
code are available for further exploration.

<p class="mathjax">Existing communications and behavioral theories have been adopted to address
health misinformation. Although various theories and models have been used to
investigate the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no framework specially designed for
social listening or misinformation studies using social media data and natural
language processing techniques. This study aimed to propose a novel yet
theory-based conceptual framework for misinformation research. We collected
theories and models used in COVID-19 related studies published in peer-reviewed
journals. The theories and models ranged from health behaviors, communications,
to misinformation. They are analyzed and critiqued for their components,
followed by proposing a conceptual framework with a demonstration. We reviewed
Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior/Reasoned Action, Communication
for Behavioral Impact, Transtheoretical Model, Uses and Gratifications Theory,
Social Judgment Theory, Risk Information Seeking and Processing Model,
Behavioral and Social Drivers, and Hype Loop. Accordingly, we proposed the
Social Media Listening for Public Health Behavior Conceptual Framework by not
only integrating important attributes of existing theories, but also adding new
attributes. The proposed conceptual framework was demonstrated in the Freedom
Convoy social media listening. The proposed conceptual framework can be used to
better understand public discourse on social media, and it can be integrated
with other data analyses to gather a more comprehensive picture. The framework
will continue to be revised and adopted as health misinformation evolves.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling and predicting the performance of students in collaborative learning
paradigms is an important task. Most of the research presented in literature
regarding collaborative learning focuses on the discussion forums and social
learning networks. There are only a few works that investigate how students
interact with each other in team projects and how such interactions affect
their academic performance. In order to bridge this gap, we choose a software
engineering course as the study subject. The students who participate in a
software engineering course are required to team up and complete a software
project together. In this work, we construct an interaction graph based on the
activities of students grouped in various teams. Based on this student
interaction graph, we present an extended graph transformer framework for
collaborative learning (CLGT) for evaluating and predicting the performance of
students. Moreover, the proposed CLGT contains an interpretation module that
explains the prediction results and visualizes the student interaction
patterns. The experimental results confirm that the proposed CLGT outperforms
the baseline models in terms of performing predictions based on the real-world
datasets. Moreover, the proposed CLGT differentiates the students with poor
performance in the collaborative learning paradigm and gives teachers early
warnings, so that appropriate assistance can be provided.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchain, pivotal in shaping the metaverse and Web3, often draws criticism
for high energy consumption and carbon emission. The rise of
sustainability-focused blockchains, especially when intersecting with
innovative wireless technologies, revises this predicament. To understand
blockchain's role in sustainability, we propose a three-layers structure
encapsulating four green utilities: Recording and Tracking, Wide Verification,
Value Trading, and Concept Disseminating. Nori, a decentralized voluntary
carbon offset project, serves as our case, illuminating these utilities. Our
research unveils unique insights into the on-chain carbon market participants,
affect factors of the market, value propositions of NFT-based carbon credits,
and the role of social media to spread the concept of carbon offset. We argue
that blockchain's contribution to sustainability is significant, with carbon
offsetting potentially evolving as a new standard within the blockchain sector.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating spatially distributed hydrological parameters in ungauged
catchments poses a challenging regionalization problem and requires imposing
spatial constraints given the sparsity of discharge data. A possible approach
is to search for a transfer function that quantitatively relates physical
descriptors to conceptual model parameters. This paper introduces a Hybrid Data
Assimilation and Parameter Regionalization (HDA-PR) approach incorporating
learnable regionalization mappings, based on either multivariate regressions or
neural networks, into a differentiable hydrological model. It enables the
exploitation of heterogeneous datasets across extensive spatio-temporal
computational domains within a high-dimensional regionalization context, using
accurate adjoint-based gradients. The inverse problem is tackled with a
multi-gauge calibration cost function accounting for information from multiple
observation sites. HDA-PR was tested on high-resolution, hourly and kilometric
regional modeling of two flash-flood-prone areas located in the South of
France. In both study areas, the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) scores
ranged from 0.52 to 0.78 at pseudo-ungauged sites over calibration and
validation periods. These results highlight a strong regionalization
performance of HDA-PR, improving NSE by up to 0.57 compared to the baseline
model calibrated with lumped parameters, and achieving a performance comparable
to the reference solution obtained with local uniform calibration (median NSE
from 0.59 to 0.79). Multiple evaluation metrics based on flood-oriented
hydrological signatures are also employed to assess the accuracy and robustness
of the approach. The regionalization method is amenable to state-parameter
correction from multi-source data over a range of time scales needed for
operational data assimilation, and it is adaptable to other differentiable
geophysical models.

<p class="mathjax">The EU AI Act Article 5 is designed to regulate AI manipulation to prevent
potential harmful consequences. However, the practical implementation of this
legislation is challenging due to the ambiguous terminologies and the unclear
presentations of manipulative techniques. Moreover, the Article 5 also suffers
criticize of inadequate protective efficacy. This paper attempts to clarify
terminologies and to enhance the protective efficacy by integrating insights
from psychology and behavioral economics. Firstly, this paper employs cognitive
psychology research to elucidate the term subliminal techniques and its
associated representation. Additionally, this paper extends the study of
heuristics: a set of thinking shortcuts which can be aroused for behavior
changing from behavior economics to the realm of manipulative techniques. The
elucidation and expansion of terminologies not only provide a more accurate
understanding of the legal provision but also enhance its protective efficacy.
Secondly, this paper proposes five classical heuristics and their associated
examples to illustrate how can AI arouse those heuristics to alter users
behavior. The enumeration of heuristics serves as a practical guide for
stakeholders such as AI developers, algorithm auditors, users, and legal
practitioners, enabling them to identify manipulative techniques and implement
countermeasures. Finally, this paper critically evaluates the protective
efficacy of Article 5 for both the general public and vulnerable groups. This
paper argues that the current protective efficacy of Article 5 is insufficient
and thus proposes specific revision suggestions to terms a and b in Article 5
to enhance its protective efficacy. This work contributes to the ongoing
discourse on AI ethics and legal regulations, providing a practical guide for
interpreting and applying the EU AI Act Article 5.

timely insights into how a patient is coping with their condition (disease
progression, treatment response, etc.), complementing treatment in traditional
healthcare settings.Smartphones with embedded and connected sensors have
immense potential for improving healthcare through various apps and mHealth
(mobile health) platforms. This capability could enable the development of
reliable digital biomarkers from long-term longitudinal data collected remotely
from patients. We built an open-source platform, RADAR-base, to support
large-scale data collection in remote monitoring studies. RADAR-base is a
modern remote data collection platform built around Confluent's Apache Kafka,
to support scalability, extensibility, security, privacy and quality of data.
It provides support for study design and set-up, active (eg PROMs) and passive
(eg. phone sensors, wearable devices and IoT) remote data collection
capabilities with feature generation (eg. behavioural, environmental and
physiological markers). The backend enables secure data transmission, and
scalable solutions for data storage, management and data access. The platform
has successfully collected longitudinal data for various cohorts in a number of
disease areas including Multiple Sclerosis, Depression, Epilepsy, ADHD,
Alzheimer, Autism and Lung diseases. Digital biomarkers developed through
collected data are providing useful insights into different diseases.
RADAR-base provides a modern open-source, community-driven solution for remote
monitoring, data collection, and digital phenotyping of physical and mental
health diseases. Clinicians can use digital biomarkers to augment their
decision making for the prevention, personalisation and early intervention of
disease.

<p class="mathjax">The realm of data science, once reserved for specialists, is undergoing a
revolution with the rapid emergence of generative AI, particularly through
tools like ChatGPT. This paper posits ChatGPT as a pivotal bridge, drastically
lowering the steep learning curve traditionally associated with complex data
analysis. By generating intuitive data narratives and offering real-time
assistance, ChatGPT democratizes the field, enabling a wider audience to glean
insights from intricate datasets. A notable illustration of this transformative
potential is provided through the examination of a synthetically generated
telematics dataset, wherein ChatGPT aids in distilling complex patterns and
insights. However, the journey to democratization is not without its hurdles.
The paper delves into challenges presented by such AI, from potential biases in
analysis to ChatGPT's limited reasoning capabilities. While the promise of a
democratized data science landscape beckons, it is imperative to approach this
transition with caution, cognizance, and an ever-evolving understanding of the
tool's capabilities and constraints.

<p class="mathjax">A single unexpected object on the road can cause an accident or may lead to
injuries. To prevent this, we need a reliable mechanism for finding anomalous
objects on the road. This task, called anomaly segmentation, can be a stepping
stone to safe and reliable autonomous driving. Current approaches tackle
anomaly segmentation by assigning an anomaly score to each pixel and by
grouping anomalous regions using simple heuristics. However, pixel grouping is
a limiting factor when it comes to evaluating the segmentation performance of
individual anomalous objects. To address the issue of grouping multiple anomaly
instances into one, we propose an approach that produces accurate anomaly
instance masks. Our approach centers on an out-of-distribution segmentation
model for identifying uncertain regions and a strong generalist segmentation
model for anomaly instances segmentation. We investigate ways to use uncertain
regions to guide such a segmentation model to perform segmentation of anomalous
instances. By incorporating strong object priors from a generalist model we
additionally improve the per-pixel anomaly segmentation performance. Our
approach outperforms current pixel-level anomaly segmentation methods,
achieving an AP of 80.08% and 88.98% on the Fishyscapes Lost and Found and the
RoadAnomaly validation sets respectively. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">This paper critically evaluates the European Commission's proposed AI Act's
approach to risk management and risk acceptability for high-risk AI systems
that pose risks to fundamental rights and safety. The Act aims to promote
"trustworthy" AI with a proportionate regulatory burden. Its provisions on risk
acceptability require residual risks from high-risk systems to be reduced or
eliminated "as far as possible", having regard to the "state of the art". This
criterion, especially if interpreted narrowly, is unworkable and promotes
neither proportionate regulatory burden, nor trustworthiness. By contrast the
Parliament's most recent draft amendments to the risk management provisions
introduce "reasonableness", cost-benefit analysis, and are more transparent
about the value-laden and contextual nature of risk acceptability judgements.
This paper argues that the Parliament's approach is more workable, and better
balances the goals of proportionality and trustworthiness. It explains what
reasonableness in risk acceptability judgments would entail, drawing on
principles from negligence law and European medical devices regulation. And it
contends that the approach to risk acceptability judgments need a firm
foundation of civic legitimacy: including detailed guidance or involvement from
regulators, and meaningful input from affected stakeholders.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic synthesis of analog and Radio Frequency (RF) circuits is a trending
approach that requires an efficient circuit modeling method. This is due to the
expensive cost of running a large number of simulations at each synthesis
cycle. Artificial intelligence methods are promising approaches for circuit
modeling due to their speed and relative accuracy. However, existing approaches
require a large amount of training data, which is still collected using
simulation runs. In addition, such approaches collect a whole separate dataset
for each circuit topology even if a single element is added or removed. These
matters are only exacerbated by the need for post-layout modeling simulations,
which take even longer. To alleviate these drawbacks, in this paper, we present
FuNToM, a functional modeling method for RF circuits. FuNToM leverages the
two-port analysis method for modeling multiple topologies using a single main
dataset and multiple small datasets. It also leverages neural networks which
have shown promising results in predicting the behavior of circuits. Our
results show that for multiple RF circuits, in comparison to the
state-of-the-art works, while maintaining the same accuracy, the required
training data is reduced by 2.8x - 10.9x. In addition, FuNToM needs 176.8x -
188.6x less time for collecting the training set in post-layout modeling.

<p class="mathjax">Document layout analysis (DLA) is the task of detecting the distinct,
semantic content within a document and correctly classifying these items into
an appropriate category (e.g., text, title, figure). DLA pipelines enable users
to convert documents into structured machine-readable formats that can then be
used for many useful downstream tasks. Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
DLA models represent documents as images, discarding the rich metadata
available in electronically generated PDFs. Directly leveraging this metadata,
we represent each PDF page as a structured graph and frame the DLA problem as a
graph segmentation and classification problem. We introduce the Graph-based
Layout Analysis Model (GLAM), a lightweight graph neural network competitive
with SOTA models on two challenging DLA datasets - while being an order of
magnitude smaller than existing models. In particular, the 4-million parameter
GLAM model outperforms the leading 140M+ parameter computer vision-based model
on 5 of the 11 classes on the DocLayNet dataset. A simple ensemble of these two
models achieves a new state-of-the-art on DocLayNet, increasing mAP from 76.8
to 80.8. Overall, GLAM is over 5 times more efficient than SOTA models, making
GLAM a favorable engineering choice for DLA tasks.

<p class="mathjax">PyPartMC is a Pythonic interface to PartMC, a stochastic, particle-resolved
aerosol model implemented in Fortran. Both PyPartMC and PartMC are free, libre,
and open-source. PyPartMC reduces the number of steps and mitigates the effort
necessary to install and utilize the resources of PartMC. Without PyPartMC,
setting up PartMC requires: working with UNIX shell, providing Fortran and C
libraries, and performing standard Fortran and C source code configuration,
compilation and linking. This can be challenging for those less experienced
with computational research or those intending to use PartMC in environments
where provision of UNIX tools is less straightforward (e.g., on Windows).
PyPartMC offers a single-step installation process of PartMC and all
dependencies through the pip Python package manager on Linux, macOS, and
Windows. This allows streamlined access to the unmodified and versioned Fortran
internals of the PartMC codebase from both Python and other interoperable
environments (e.g., Julia through PyCall). Consequently, users of PyPartMC can
setup, run, process and visualize output of PartMC simulations using a single
general-purpose programming language.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread deployment in various
real-world applications. Understanding these biases is crucial to comprehend
the potential downstream consequences when using LLMs to make decisions,
particularly for historically disadvantaged groups. In this work, we propose a
simple method for analyzing and comparing demographic bias in LLMs, through the
lens of job recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by
measuring intersectional biases within ChatGPT and LLaMA, two cutting-edge
LLMs. Our experiments primarily focus on uncovering gender identity and
nationality bias; however, our method can be extended to examine biases
associated with any intersection of demographic identities. We identify
distinct biases in both models toward various demographic identities, such as
both models consistently suggesting low-paying jobs for Mexican workers or
preferring to recommend secretarial roles to women. Our study highlights the
importance of measuring the bias of LLMs in downstream applications to
understand the potential for harm and inequitable outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems that include some reliability measure of their
predictions tend to be more conservative in forecasting, due to their
constraint to preserve reliability. This leads to a significant drop in the
coverage and novelty that these systems can provide. In this paper, we propose
the inclusion of a new term in the learning process of matrix
factorization-based recommender systems, called recklessness, which enables the
control of the risk level desired when making decisions about the reliability
of a prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that recklessness not only
allows for risk regulation but also improves the quantity and quality of
predictions provided by the recommender system.

<p class="mathjax">Obtaining versions of deep neural networks that are both highly-accurate and
highly-sparse is one of the main challenges in the area of model compression,
and several high-performance pruning techniques have been investigated by the
community. Yet, much less is known about the interaction between sparsity and
the standard stochastic optimization techniques used for training sparse
networks, and most existing work uses standard dense schedules and
hyperparameters for training sparse networks. In this work, we examine the
impact of high sparsity on model training using the standard computer vision
and natural language processing sparsity benchmarks. We begin by showing that
using standard dense training recipes for sparse training is suboptimal, and
results in under-training. We provide new approaches for mitigating this issue
for both sparse pre-training of vision models (e.g. ResNet50/ImageNet) and
sparse fine-tuning of language models (e.g. BERT/GLUE), achieving
state-of-the-art results in both settings in the high-sparsity regime, and
providing detailed analyses for the difficulty of sparse training in both
scenarios. Our work sets a new threshold in terms of the accuracies that can be
achieved under high sparsity, and should inspire further research into
improving sparse model training, to reach higher accuracies under high
sparsity, but also to do so efficiently.

<p class="mathjax">There has been tremendous progress in generating realistic faces with high
fidelity over the past few years. Despite this progress, a crucial question
remains unanswered: "Given a generative face model, how many unique identities
can it generate?" In other words, what is the biometric capacity of the
generative face model? A scientific basis for answering this question will
benefit evaluating and comparing different generative face models and establish
an upper bound on their scalability. This paper proposes a statistical approach
to estimate the biometric capacity of generated face images in a hyperspherical
feature space. We employ our approach on multiple generative models, including
unconditional generators like StyleGAN, Latent Diffusion Model, and "Generated
Photos," as well as DCFace, a class-conditional generator. We also estimate
capacity w.r.t. demographic attributes such as gender and age. Our capacity
estimates indicate that (a) under ArcFace representation at a false acceptance
rate (FAR) of 0.1%, StyleGAN3 and DCFace have a capacity upper bound of
$1.43\times10^6$ and $1.190\times10^4$, respectively; (b) the capacity reduces
drastically as we lower the desired FAR with an estimate of $1.796\times10^4$
and $562$ at FAR of 1% and 10%, respectively, for StyleGAN3; (c) there is no
discernible disparity in the capacity w.r.t gender; and (d) for some generative
models, there is an appreciable disparity in the capacity w.r.t age. Code is
available at https://github.com/human-analysis/capacity-generative-face-models.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-task learning (MTL) seeks to learn a single model to accomplish
multiple tasks by leveraging shared information among the tasks. Existing MTL
models, however, have been known to suffer from negative interference among
tasks. Efforts to mitigate task interference have focused on either
loss/gradient balancing or implicit parameter partitioning with partial
overlaps among the tasks. In this paper, we propose ETR-NLP to mitigate task
interference through a synergistic combination of non-learnable primitives
(NLPs) and explicit task routing (ETR). Our key idea is to employ non-learnable
primitives to extract a diverse set of task-agnostic features and recombine
them into a shared branch common to all tasks and explicit task-specific
branches reserved for each task. The non-learnable primitives and the explicit
decoupling of learnable parameters into shared and task-specific ones afford
the flexibility needed for minimizing task interference. We evaluate the
efficacy of ETR-NLP networks for both image-level classification and
pixel-level dense prediction MTL problems. Experimental results indicate that
ETR-NLP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with fewer
learnable parameters and similar FLOPs across all datasets. Code is available

<p class="mathjax">Misinformation, propaganda, and outright lies proliferate on the web, with
some narratives having dangerous real-world consequences on public health,
elections, and individual safety. However, despite the impact of
misinformation, the research community largely lacks automated and programmatic
approaches for tracking news narratives across online platforms. In this work,
utilizing daily scrapes of 1,404 unreliable news websites, the large-language
model MPNet, and DP-Means clustering, we introduce a system to automatically
isolate and analyze the narratives spread within online ecosystems. Identifying
55,301 narratives on these 1,404 websites, we describe the most prevalent
narratives spread in 2022 and identify the most influential websites that
originate and magnify narratives. Finally, we show how our system can be
utilized to detect new narratives originating from unreliable news websites and
aid fact-checkers like Politifact, Reuters, and AP News in more quickly
addressing misinformation stories.

<p class="mathjax">This report outlines the concepts, mechanisms and inner dynamics of the BEAM
(Behavior, Energy, Autonomy, and Mobility) modeling framework. BEAM is an
open-source large-scale high-resolution transportation model that harnesses the
principles of the actor model of computation to build a powerful and efficient
agent-based model of travel behavior. It allows a detailed microscopic view of
how people make travel choices and interact with the transportation system,
enabling more accurate simulations of human mobility and urban transport
networks. It also allows the analysis of numerous spatially defined but
interacting layers, and integrates them into a cohesive representation of a
regional transportation system. This integrated picture provides invaluable
insights to policy makers and other stakeholders about how changes to the
transportation system result in changes to traffic congestion, mode share,
energy use, and emissions throughout a modeled region. These capabilities are
demonstrated with a case study of New York City that showcase BEAM's
application in a very large and intricate urban transportation system, without
relying on existing travel demand models. The unique ability of BEAM to
simulate individual behaviors, integrate with other models, and adapt to
different real-world scenarios underscores its importance in the rapidly
evolving field of transportation and emphasizes its potential as a valuable
proof-of-concept tool to contribute to more informed and effective policy and
planning decisions.

<p class="mathjax">Social media platforms, despite their value in promoting open discourse, are
often exploited to spread harmful content. Current deep learning and natural
language processing models used for detecting this harmful content overly rely
on domain-specific terms affecting their capabilities to adapt to generalizable
hate speech detection. This is because they tend to focus too narrowly on
particular linguistic signals or the use of certain categories of words.
Another significant challenge arises when platforms lack high-quality annotated
data for training, leading to a need for cross-platform models that can adapt
to different distribution shifts. Our research introduces a cross-platform hate
speech detection model capable of being trained on one platform's data and
generalizing to multiple unseen platforms. To achieve good generalizability
across platforms, one way is to disentangle the input representations into
invariant and platform-dependent features. We also argue that learning causal
relationships, which remain constant across diverse environments, can
significantly aid in understanding invariant representations in hate speech. By
disentangling input into platform-dependent features (useful for predicting
hate targets) and platform-independent features (used to predict the presence
of hate), we learn invariant representations resistant to distribution shifts.
These features are then used to predict hate speech across unseen platforms.
Our extensive experiments across four platforms highlight our model's enhanced
efficacy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in detecting generalized
hate speech.

<p class="mathjax">Bias in applications of machine learning (ML) to healthcare is usually
attributed to unrepresentative or incomplete data, or to underlying health
disparities. This article identifies a more pervasive source of bias that
affects the clinical utility of ML-enabled prediction tools: target
specification bias. Target specification bias arises when the
operationalization of the target variable does not match its definition by
decision makers. The mismatch is often subtle, and stems from the fact that
decision makers are typically interested in predicting the outcomes of
counterfactual, rather than actual, healthcare scenarios. Target specification
bias persists independently of data limitations and health disparities. When
left uncorrected, it gives rise to an overestimation of predictive accuracy, to
inefficient utilization of medical resources, and to suboptimal decisions that
can harm patients. Recent work in metrology - the science of measurement -
suggests ways of counteracting target specification bias and avoiding its
harmful consequences.

<p class="mathjax">Most machine learning (ML) systems assume stationary and matching data
distributions during training and deployment. This is often a false assumption.
When ML models are deployed on real devices, data distributions often shift
over time due to changes in environmental factors, sensor characteristics, and
task-of-interest. While it is possible to have a human-in-the-loop to monitor
for distribution shifts and engineer new architectures in response to these
shifts, such a setup is not cost-effective. Instead, non-stationary automated
ML (AutoML) models are needed. This paper presents the
Encoder-Adaptor-Reconfigurator (EAR) framework for efficient continual learning
under domain shifts. The EAR framework uses a fixed deep neural network (DNN)
feature encoder and trains shallow networks on top of the encoder to handle
novel data. The EAR framework is capable of 1) detecting when new data is
out-of-distribution (OOD) by combining DNNs with hyperdimensional computing
(HDC), 2) identifying low-parameter neural adaptors to adapt the model to the
OOD data using zero-shot neural architecture search (ZS-NAS), and 3) minimizing
catastrophic forgetting on previous tasks by progressively growing the neural
architecture as needed and dynamically routing data through the appropriate
adaptors and reconfigurators for handling domain-incremental and
class-incremental continual learning. We systematically evaluate our approach
on several benchmark datasets for domain adaptation and demonstrate strong
performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for OOD detection and
few-/zero-shot NAS.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate transcription of proper names and technical terms is particularly
important in speech-to-text applications for business conversations. These
words, which are essential to understanding the conversation, are often rare
and therefore likely to be under-represented in text and audio training data,
creating a significant challenge in this domain. We present a two-step keyword
boosting mechanism that successfully works on normalized unigrams and n-grams
rather than just single tokens, which eliminates missing hits issues with
boosting raw targets. In addition, we show how adjusting the boosting weight
logic avoids over-boosting multi-token keywords. This improves our keyword
recognition rate by 26% relative on our proprietary in-domain dataset and 2% on
LibriSpeech. This method is particularly useful on targets that involve
non-alphabetic characters or have non-standard pronunciations.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modality image fusion and segmentation play a vital role in autonomous
driving and robotic operation. Early efforts focus on boosting the performance
for only one task, \emph{e.g.,} fusion or segmentation, making it hard to
reach~`Best of Both Worlds'. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose
a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{i}nteractive \textbf{F}eature learning architecture
for image fusion and \textbf{Seg}mentation, namely SegMiF, and exploit
dual-task correlation to promote the performance of both tasks. The SegMiF is
of a cascade structure, containing a fusion sub-network and a commonly used
segmentation sub-network. By slickly bridging intermediate features between two
components, the knowledge learned from the segmentation task can effectively
assist the fusion task. Also, the benefited fusion network supports the
segmentation one to perform more pretentiously. Besides, a hierarchical
interactive attention block is established to ensure fine-grained mapping of
all the vital information between two tasks, so that the modality/semantic
features can be fully mutual-interactive. In addition, a dynamic weight factor
is introduced to automatically adjust the corresponding weights of each task,
which can balance the interactive feature correspondence and break through the
limitation of laborious tuning. Furthermore, we construct a smart multi-wave
binocular imaging system and collect a full-time multi-modality benchmark with
15 annotated pixel-level categories for image fusion and segmentation.
Extensive experiments on several public datasets and our benchmark demonstrate
that the proposed method outputs visually appealing fused images and perform
averagely $7.66\%$ higher segmentation mIoU in the real-world scene than the
state-of-the-art approaches. The source code and benchmark are available at

<p class="mathjax">Script Event Prediction (SEP) aims to predict the subsequent event for a
given event chain from a candidate list. Prior research has achieved great
success by integrating external knowledge to enhance the semantics, but it is
laborious to acquisite the appropriate knowledge resources and retrieve the
script-related knowledge. In this paper, we regard public pre-trained language
models as knowledge bases and automatically mine the script-related knowledge
via prompt-learning. Still, the scenario-diversity and label-ambiguity in
scripts make it uncertain to construct the most functional prompt and label
token in prompt learning, i.e., prompt-uncertainty and verbalizer-uncertainty.
Considering the innate ability of Gaussian distribution to express uncertainty,
we deploy the prompt tokens and label tokens as random variables following
Gaussian distributions, where a prompt estimator and a verbalizer estimator are
proposed to estimate their probabilistic representations instead of
deterministic representations. We take the lead to explore prompt-learning in
SEP and provide a fresh perspective to enrich the script semantics. Our method
is evaluated on the most widely used benchmark and a newly proposed large-scale
one. Experiments show that our method, which benefits from knowledge evoked
from pre-trained language models, outperforms prior baselines by 1.46\% and
1.05\% on two benchmarks, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">In freeze drying, thermal radiation has a significant effect on the drying
process of vials located near the corner and edge of the trays, resulting in
non-uniformity of the products. Understanding and being able to predict the
impact of thermal radiation are therefore critical to accurate determination of
the drying process endpoint given the variation in heat transfer of each vial.
This article presents a new mechanistic model that describes complex thermal
radiation during primary drying in conventional, microwave-assisted, and hybrid
freeze drying. Modeling of thermal radiation employs the diffuse gray surface
model and radiation network approach, which systematically and accurately
incorporates simultaneous radiation exchange between every surface including
the chamber wall and vials, allowing the framework to be seamlessly applied for
analyzing various freeze-dryer designs. Model validation with data from the
literature shows accurate prediction of the drying times for all vials,
including inner, edge, and corner vials. The validated model is demonstrated
for thermal radiation analysis and parametric studies to guide the design and
optimization of freeze dryers.

<p class="mathjax">Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction (AOPE) from Chinese financial texts is a
specialized task in fine-grained text sentiment analysis. The main objective is
to extract aspect terms and opinion terms simultaneously from a diverse range
of financial texts. Previous studies have mainly focused on developing grid
annotation schemes within grid-based models to facilitate this extraction
process. However, these methods often rely on character-level (token-level)
feature encoding, which may overlook the logical relationships between Chinese
characters within words. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method
called Graph-based Character-level Grid Tagging Scheme (GCGTS). The GCGTS
method explicitly incorporates syntactic structure using Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCN) and unifies the encoding of characters within the same syntactic
semantic unit (Chinese word level). Additionally, we introduce an image
convolutional structure into the grid model to better capture the local
relationships between characters within evaluation units. This innovative
structure reduces the excessive reliance on pre-trained language models and
emphasizes the modeling of structure and local relationships, thereby improving
the performance of the model on Chinese financial texts. Through comparative
experiments with advanced models such as Synchronous Double-channel Recurrent
Network (SDRN) and Grid Tagging Scheme (GTS), the proposed GCGTS model
demonstrates significant improvements in performance.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring the reliability of face recognition systems against presentation
attacks necessitates the deployment of face anti-spoofing techniques. Despite
considerable advancements in this domain, the ability of even the most
state-of-the-art methods to defend against adversarial examples remains
elusive. While several adversarial defense strategies have been proposed, they
typically suffer from constrained practicability due to inevitable trade-offs
between universality, effectiveness, and efficiency. To overcome these
challenges, we thoroughly delve into the coupled relationship between
adversarial detection and face anti-spoofing. Based on this, we propose a
robust face anti-spoofing framework, namely AdvFAS, that leverages two coupled
scores to accurately distinguish between correctly detected and wrongly
detected face images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework in a variety of settings, including different attacks, datasets,
and backbones, meanwhile enjoying high accuracy on clean examples. Moreover, we
successfully apply the proposed method to detect real-world adversarial
examples.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) conduct message passing which aggregates local
neighbors to update node representations. Such message passing leads to
scalability issues in practical latency-constrained applications. To address
this issue, recent methods adopt knowledge distillation (KD) to learn
computationally-efficient multi-layer perceptron (MLP) by mimicking the output
of GNN. However, the existing GNN representation space may not be expressive
enough for representing diverse local structures of the underlying graph, which
limits the knowledge transfer from GNN to MLP. Here we present a novel
framework VQGraph to learn a powerful graph representation space for bridging
GNNs and MLPs. We adopt the encoder of a variant of a vector-quantized
variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) as a structure-aware graph tokenizer, which
explicitly represents the nodes of diverse local structures as numerous
discrete tokens and constitutes a meaningful codebook. Equipped with the
learned codebook, we propose a new token-based distillation objective based on
soft token assignments to sufficiently transfer the structural knowledge from
GNN to MLP. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the strong
performance of VQGraph, where we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on
GNN-MLP distillation in both transductive and inductive settings across seven
graph datasets. We show that VQGraph with better performance infers faster than
GNNs by 828x, and also achieves accuracy improvement over GNNs and stand-alone
MLPs by 3.90% and 28.05% on average, respectively. Code:

<p class="mathjax">Class activation maps are widely used for explaining deep neural networks.
Due to its ability to highlight regions of interest, it has evolved in recent
years as a key step in weakly supervised learning. A major limitation to the
performance of the class activation maps is the small spatial resolution of the
feature maps in the last layer of the convolutional neural network. Therefore,
we expect to generate high-resolution feature maps that result in high-quality
semantic information. In this paper, we rethink the properties of semantic
information in shallow feature maps. We find that the shallow feature maps
still have fine-grained non-discriminative features while mixing considerable
non-target noise. Furthermore, we propose a simple gradient-based denoising
method to filter the noise by truncating the positive gradient. Our proposed
scheme can be easily deployed in other CAM-related methods, facilitating these
methods to obtain higher-quality class activation maps. We evaluate the
proposed approach through a weakly-supervised semantic segmentation task, and a
large number of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a lightweight pipeline for skin lesion detection,
addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced class distribution and subtle or
atypical appearances of some lesions. The pipeline is built around a
lightweight model that leverages ghosted features and the DFC attention
mechanism to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high
performance. The model was trained on the HAM10000 dataset, which includes
various types of skin lesions. To address the class imbalance in the dataset,
the synthetic minority over-sampling technique and various image augmentation
techniques were used. The model also incorporates a knowledge-based loss
weighting technique, which assigns different weights to the loss function at
the class level and the instance level, helping the model focus on minority
classes and challenging samples. This technique involves assigning different
weights to the loss function on two levels - the class level and the instance
level. By applying appropriate loss weights, the model pays more attention to
the minority classes and challenging samples, thus improving its ability to
correctly detect and classify different skin lesions. The model achieved an
accuracy of 92.4%, a precision of 84.2%, a recall of 86.9%, a f1-score of 85.4%
with particularly strong performance in identifying Benign Keratosis-like
lesions (BKL) and Nevus (NV). Despite its superior performance, the model's
computational cost is considerably lower than some models with less accuracy,
making it an optimal solution for real-world applications where both accuracy
and efficiency are essential.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the life cycle of the machine learning (ML) model is an
intriguing area of research (e.g., understanding where the model comes from,
how it is trained, and how it is used). This paper focuses on a novel problem
within this field, namely Model Provenance (MP), which concerns the
relationship between a target model and its pre-training model and aims to
determine whether a source model serves as the provenance for a target model.
This is an important problem that has significant implications for ensuring the
security and intellectual property of machine learning models but has not
received much attention in the literature. To fill in this gap, we introduce a
novel concept of Model DNA which represents the unique characteristics of a
machine learning model. We utilize a data-driven and model-driven
representation learning method to encode the model's training data and
input-output information as a compact and comprehensive representation (i.e.,
DNA) of the model. Using this model DNA, we develop an efficient framework for
model provenance identification, which enables us to identify whether a source
model is a pre-training model of a target model. We conduct evaluations on both
computer vision and natural language processing tasks using various models,
datasets, and scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately identifying model provenance.

<p class="mathjax">Backdoor attacks have emerged as a prominent threat to natural language
processing (NLP) models, where the presence of specific triggers in the input
can lead poisoned models to misclassify these inputs to predetermined target
classes. Current detection mechanisms are limited by their inability to address
more covert backdoor strategies, such as style-based attacks. In this work, we
propose an innovative test-time poisoned sample detection framework that hinges
on the interpretability of model predictions, grounded in the semantic meaning
of inputs. We contend that triggers (e.g., infrequent words) are not supposed
to fundamentally alter the underlying semantic meanings of poisoned samples as
they want to stay stealthy. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that
while the model's predictions for paraphrased clean samples should remain
stable, predictions for poisoned samples should revert to their true labels
upon the mutations applied to triggers during the paraphrasing process. We
employ ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model, as our paraphraser and
formulate the trigger-removal task as a prompt engineering problem. We adopt
fuzzing, a technique commonly used for unearthing software vulnerabilities, to
discover optimal paraphrase prompts that can effectively eliminate triggers
while concurrently maintaining input semantics. Experiments on 4 types of
backdoor attacks, including the subtle style backdoors, and 4 distinct datasets
demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods, including STRIP, RAP,
and ONION, in precision and recall.

<p class="mathjax">Second-order optimization algorithms exhibit excellent convergence properties
for training deep learning models, but often incur significant computation and
memory overheads. This can result in lower training efficiency than the
first-order counterparts such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this
work, we present a memory- and time-efficient second-order algorithm named Eva
with two novel techniques: 1) we construct the second-order information with
the Kronecker factorization of small stochastic vectors over a mini-batch of
training data to reduce memory consumption, and 2) we derive an efficient
update formula without explicitly computing the inverse of matrices using the
Sherman-Morrison formula. We further extend Eva to a general vectorized
approximation framework to improve the compute and memory efficiency of two
existing second-order algorithms (FOOF and Shampoo) without affecting their
convergence performance. Extensive experimental results on different models and
datasets show that Eva reduces the end-to-end training time up to 2.05x and
2.42x compared to first-order SGD and second-order algorithms (K-FAC and
Shampoo), respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Sensor fusion approaches for intelligent self-driving agents remain key to
driving scene understanding given visual global contexts acquired from input
sensors. Specifically, for the local waypoint prediction task, single-modality
networks are still limited by strong dependency on the sensitivity of the input
sensor, and thus recent works promote the use of multiple sensors in fusion in
feature level. While it is well known that multiple data modalities promote
mutual contextual exchange, deployment to practical driving scenarios requires
global 3D scene understanding in real-time with minimal computations, thus
placing greater significance on training strategies given a limited number of
practically usable sensors. In this light, we exploit carefully selected
auxiliary tasks that are highly correlated with the target task of interest
(e.g., traffic light recognition and semantic segmentation) by fusing auxiliary
task features and also using auxiliary heads for waypoint prediction based on
imitation learning. Our multi-task feature fusion augments and improves the
base network, TransFuser, by significant margins for safer and more complete
road navigation in CARLA simulator as validated on the Town05 Benchmark through
extensive experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Web 2.0 recommendation systems, such as Yelp, connect users and businesses so
that users can identify new businesses and simultaneously express their
experiences in the form of reviews. Yelp recommendation software moderates
user-provided content by categorizing them into recommended and not-recommended
sections. Due to Yelp's substantial popularity and its high impact on local
businesses' success, understanding the fairness of its algorithms is crucial.
However, with no access to the training data and the algorithms used by such
black-box systems, studying their fairness is not trivial, requiring a
tremendous effort to minimize bias in data collection and consider the
confounding factors in the analysis.
<br />This large-scale data-driven study, for the first time, investigates Yelp's
business ranking and review recommendation system through the lens of fairness.
We define and examine 4 hypotheses to examine if Yelp's recommendation software
shows bias and if Yelp's business ranking algorithm shows bias against
restaurants located in specific neighborhoods. Our findings show that reviews
of female and less-established users are disproportionately categorized as
recommended. We also find a positive association between restaurants being
located in hotspot regions and their average exposure. Furthermore, we observed
some cases of severe disparity bias in cities where the hotspots are in
neighborhoods with less demographic diversity or areas with higher affluence
and education levels. Indeed, biases introduced by data-driven systems,
including our findings in this paper, are (almost) always implicit and through
proxy attributes. Still, the authors believe such implicit biases should be
detected and resolved as those can create cycles of discrimination that keep
increasing the social gaps between different groups even further.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a power-constrained hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)
transmission strategy is developed to support ultra-reliable low-latency
communications (URLLC). In particular, we aim to minimize the delivery latency
of HARQ schemes over time-correlated fading channels, meanwhile ensuring the
high reliability and limited power consumption. To ease the optimization, the
simple asymptotic outage expressions of HARQ schemes are adopted. Furthermore,
by noticing the non-convexity of the latency minimization problem and the
intricate connection between different HARQ rounds, the graph convolutional
network (GCN) is invoked for the optimal power solution owing to its powerful
ability of handling the graph data. The primal-dual learning method is then
leveraged to train the GCN weights. Consequently, the numerical results are
presented for verification together with the comparisons among three HARQ
schemes in terms of the latency and the reliability, where the three HARQ
schemes include Type-I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC), and HARQ with
incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). To recapitulate, it is revealed that HARQ-IR
offers the lowest latency while guaranteeing the demanded reliability target
under a stringent power constraint, albeit at the price of high coding
complexity.

related to software systems that can self-protect. One topic in this domain is
Moving Target Defense (MTD), which changes software characteristics in the
protected system to make it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
However, MTD implementation and deployment are often impacted by run-time
uncertainties, and existing MTD decision-making solutions have neglected
uncertainty in model parameters and lack self-adaptation. This paper aims to
address this gap by proposing an approach for an uncertainty-aware and
self-adaptive MTD decision engine based on Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process and Bayesian Learning techniques. The proposed approach considers
uncertainty in both state and model parameters; thus, it has the potential to
better capture environmental variability and improve defense strategies. A

<p class="mathjax">Communication in millimeter wave (mmWave) and even terahertz (THz) frequency
bands is ushering in a new era of wireless communications. Beam management,
namely initial access and beam tracking, has been recognized as an essential
technique to ensure robust mmWave/THz communications, especially for mobile
scenarios. However, narrow beams at higher carrier frequency lead to huge beam
measurement overhead, which has a negative impact on beam acquisition and
tracking. In addition, the beam management process is further complicated by
the fluctuation of mmWave/THz channels, the random movement patterns of users,
and the dynamic changes in the environment. For mmWave and THz communications
toward 6G, we have witnessed a substantial increase in research and industrial
attention on artificial intelligence (AI), reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS), and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). The introduction of
these enabling technologies presents both open opportunities and unique
challenges for beam management. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
survey on mmWave and THz beam management. Further, we give some insights on
technical challenges and future research directions in this promising area.

<p class="mathjax">The process of industrial box-packing, which involves the accurate placement
of multiple objects, requires high-accuracy positioning and sequential actions.
When a robot is tasked with placing an object at a specific location with high
accuracy, it is important not only to have information about the location of
the object to be placed, but also the posture of the object grasped by the
robotic hand. Often, industrial box-packing requires the sequential placement
of identically shaped objects into a single box. The robot's action should be
determined by the same learned model. In factories, new kinds of products often
appear and there is a need for a model that can easily adapt to them.
Therefore, it should be easy to collect data to train the model. In this study,
we designed a robotic system to automate real-world industrial tasks, employing
a vision-based learning control model. We propose in-hand-view-sensitive
Newtonian variational autoencoder (ihVS-NVAE), which employs an RGB camera to
obtain in-hand postures of objects. We demonstrate that our model, trained for
a single object-placement task, can handle sequential tasks without additional
training. To evaluate efficacy of the proposed model, we employed a real robot
to perform sequential industrial box-packing of multiple objects. Results
showed that the proposed model achieved a 100% success rate in industrial
box-packing tasks, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art and conventional
approaches, underscoring its superior effectiveness and potential in industrial
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the concept of introducing physics to machine learning has
become widely popular. Most physics-inclusive ML-techniques however are still
limited to a single geometry or a set of parametrizable geometries. Thus, there
remains the need to train a new model for a new geometry, even if it is only
slightly modified. With this work we introduce a technique with which it is
possible to learn approximate solutions to the steady-state Navier--Stokes
equations in varying geometries without the need of parametrization. This
technique is based on a combination of a U-Net-like CNN and well established
discretization methods from the field of the finite difference method.The
results of our physics-aware CNN are compared to a state-of-the-art data-based
approach. Additionally, it is also shown how our approach performs when
combined with the data-based approach.

<p class="mathjax">This paper contributes to building a standard process of research and
development (R&amp;D) for new user experiences (UX) in metaverse services. We
tested this R&amp;D process on a new UX proof of concept (PoC) for Meta Quest
head-mounted display (HMDs) consisting of a school-life karaoke experience with
the hypothesis that it is possible to design the avatars with only the
necessary functions and rendering costs. The school life metaverse is a
relevant subject for discovering issues and problems in this type of
simultaneous connection. To qualitatively evaluate the potential of a
multi-person metaverse experience, this study investigated subjects where each
avatar requires expressive skills. While avatar play experiences feature
artistic expressions, such as dancing, playing musical instruments, and
drawing, and these can be used to evaluate their operability and expressive
capabilities qualitatively, the Quest's tracking capabilities are insufficient
for full-body performance and graphical art expression. Considering such
hardware limitations, this study evaluated the Quest, focusing primarily on UX
simplicity using AI Fusion techniques and expressiveness in instrumental scenes
played by approximately four avatars. This research reported methods for
multiuser metaverse communication and its supporting technologies, such as
head-mounted devices and their graphics performance, special interaction
techniques, and complementary tools and the importance of PoC development, its
evaluation, and its iterations. The result is remarkable for further research;
these expressive technologies in a multi-user context are directly related to
the quality of communication within the metaverse and the value of the
user-generated content (UGC) produced there.

<p class="mathjax">The complex transmission mechanism of cross-packet hybrid automatic repeat
request (XP-HARQ) hinders its optimal system design. To overcome this
difficulty, this letter attempts to use the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
to solve the rate selection problem of XP-HARQ over correlated fading channels.
In particular, the long term average throughput (LTAT) is maximized by properly
choosing the incremental information rate for each HARQ round on the basis of
the outdated channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter. The
rate selection problem is first converted into a Markov decision process (MDP),
which is then solved by capitalizing on the algorithm of deep deterministic
policy gradient (DDPG) with prioritized experience replay. The simulation
results finally corroborate the superiority of the proposed XP-HARQ scheme over
the conventional HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) and the XP-HARQ
with only statistical CSI.

<p class="mathjax">In the future, it is anticipated that software-defined networking (SDN) will
become the preferred platform for deploying diverse networks. Compared to
traditional networks, SDN separates the control and data planes for efficient
domain-wide traffic routing and management. The controllers in the control
plane are responsible for programming data plane forwarding devices, while the
top layer, the application plane, enforces policies and programs the network.
The different levels of the SDN use interfaces for communication. However, SDN
faces challenges with traffic distribution, such as load imbalance, which can
negatively affect the network performance. Consequently, developers have
developed various SDN load-balancing solutions to enhance SDN effectiveness. In
addition, researchers are considering the potential of implementing some
artificial intelligence (AI) approaches into SDN to improve network resource
usage and overall performance due to the fast growth of the AI field. This
survey focuses on the following: Firstly, analyzing the SDN architecture and
investigating the problem of load balancing in SDN. Secondly, categorizing
AI-based load balancing methods and thoroughly assessing these mechanisms from
various perspectives, such as the algorithm/technique employed, the tackled
problem, and their strengths and weaknesses. Thirdly, summarizing the metrics
utilized to measure the effectiveness of these techniques. Finally, identifying
the trends and challenges of AI-based load balancing for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Object shaping by grinding is a crucial industrial process in which a
rotating grinding belt removes material. Object-shape transition models are
essential to achieving automation by robots; however, learning such a complex
model that depends on process conditions is challenging because it requires a
significant amount of data, and the irreversible nature of the removal process
makes data collection expensive. This paper proposes a cutting-surface-aware
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) method for robotic grinding. Our
method employs a cutting-surface-aware model as the object's shape transition
model, which in turn is composed of a geometric cutting model and a
cutting-surface-deviation model, based on the assumption that the robot action
can specify the cutting surface made by the tool. Furthermore, according to the
grinding resistance theory, the cutting-surface-deviation model does not
require raw shape information, making the model's dimensions smaller and easier
to learn than a naive shape transition model directly mapping the shapes.
Through evaluation and comparison by simulation and real robot experiments, we
confirm that our MBRL method can achieve high data efficiency for learning
object shaping by grinding and also provide generalization capability for
initial and target shapes that differ from the training data.

<p class="mathjax">Recent months have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large
language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents
capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather
than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language
agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although
some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not
reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from
rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large
language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes
the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient.
Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across
multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model
which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior
failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various
tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our
approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage
gradients from the environment. This demonstrates that using policy gradient
optimization to improve language agents, for which we believe our work is one
of the first, seems promising and can be applied to optimize other models in
the agent architecture to enhance agent performances over time.

Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. The
primary contribution is the introduction of ExploitFlow (EF), an AI and Game
Theory-driven modular library designed for cyber security exploitation. EF aims
to automate attacks, combining exploits from various sources, and capturing
system states post-action to reason about them and understand potential attack
trees. The motivation behind EF is to bolster Game Theory and AI research in
cybersecurity, with robotics as the initial focus. Results indicate that EF is
effective for exploring machine learning in robot cybersecurity. An artificial
agent powered by EF, using Reinforcement Learning, outperformed both
brute-force and human expert approaches, laying the path for using ExploitFlow
for further research. Nonetheless, we identified several limitations in
EF-driven agents, including a propensity to overfit, the scarcity and
production cost of datasets for generalization, and challenges in interpreting
networking states across varied security settings. To leverage the strengths of
ExploitFlow while addressing identified shortcomings, we present Malism, our
vision for a comprehensive automated penetration testing framework with
ExploitFlow at its core.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous vehicles and robots need to operate over a wide variety of
scenarios in order to complete tasks efficiently and safely. Multi-camera
self-supervised monocular depth estimation from videos is a promising way to
reason about the environment, as it generates metrically scaled geometric
predictions from visual data without requiring additional sensors. However,
most works assume well-calibrated extrinsics to fully leverage this
multi-camera setup, even though accurate and efficient calibration is still a
challenging problem. In this work, we introduce a novel method for extrinsic
calibration that builds upon the principles of self-supervised monocular depth
and ego-motion learning. Our proposed curriculum learning strategy uses
monocular depth and pose estimators with velocity supervision to estimate
extrinsics, and then jointly learns extrinsic calibration along with depth and
pose for a set of overlapping cameras rigidly attached to a moving vehicle.
Experiments on a benchmark multi-camera dataset (DDAD) demonstrate that our
method enables self-calibration in various scenes robustly and efficiently
compared to a traditional vision-based pose estimation pipeline. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the benefits of extrinsics self-calibration as a way to improve
depth prediction via joint optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Recent score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) show promising results in
unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I). However, existing methods, either
energy-based or statistically-based, provide no explicit form of the interfered
intermediate generative distributions. This work presents a new
score-decomposed diffusion model (SDDM) on manifolds to explicitly optimize the
tangled distributions during image generation. SDDM derives manifolds to make
the distributions of adjacent time steps separable and decompose the score
function or energy guidance into an image ``denoising" part and a content
``refinement" part. To refine the image in the same noise level, we equalize
the refinement parts of the score function and energy guidance, which permits
multi-objective optimization on the manifold. We also leverage the block
adaptive instance normalization module to construct manifolds with lower
dimensions but still concentrated with the perturbed reference image. SDDM
outperforms existing SBDM-based methods with much fewer diffusion steps on
several I2I benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient differential equation solvers have significantly reduced the
sampling time of diffusion models (DMs) while retaining high sampling quality.
Among these solvers, exponential integrators (EI) have gained prominence by
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. However, existing high-order
EI-based sampling algorithms rely on degenerate EI solvers, resulting in
inferior error bounds and reduced accuracy in contrast to the theoretically
anticipated results under optimal settings. This situation makes the sampling
quality extremely vulnerable to seemingly innocuous design choices such as
timestep schedules. For example, an inefficient timestep scheduler might
necessitate twice the number of steps to achieve a quality comparable to that
obtained through carefully optimized timesteps. To address this issue, we
reevaluate the design of high-order differential solvers for DMs. Through a
thorough order analysis, we reveal that the degeneration of existing high-order
EI solvers can be attributed to the absence of essential order conditions. By
reformulating the differential equations in DMs and capitalizing on the theory
of exponential integrators, we propose refined EI solvers that fulfill all the
order conditions, which we designate as Refined Exponential Solver (RES).
Utilizing these improved solvers, RES exhibits more favorable error bounds
theoretically and achieves superior sampling efficiency and stability in
practical applications. For instance, a simple switch from the single-step
DPM-Solver++ to our order-satisfied RES solver when Number of Function
Evaluations (NFE) $=9$, results in a reduction of numerical defects by $25.2\%$
and FID improvement of $25.4\%$ (16.77 vs 12.51) on a pre-trained ImageNet
diffusion model.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the progression of information technology in recent years, document
images have been widely disseminated in social networks. With the help of
powerful image editing tools, document images are easily forged without leaving
visible manipulation traces, which leads to severe issues if significant
information is falsified for malicious use. Therefore, the research of document
image forensics is worth further exploring. In a document image, the character
with specific semantic information is most vulnerable to tampering, for which
capturing the forgery traces of the character is the key to localizing the
forged region in document images. Considering both character and image
textures, in this paper, we propose a Character Texture Perception Network
(CTP-Net) to localize the forgery of document images. Based on optical
character recognition, a Character Texture Stream (CTS) is designed to capture
features of text areas that are essential components of a document image.
Meanwhile, texture features of the whole document image are exploited by an
Image Texture Stream (ITS). Combining the features extracted from the CTS and
the ITS, the CTP-Net can reveal more subtle forgery traces from document
images. To overcome the challenge caused by the lack of fake document images,
we design a data generation strategy that is utilized to construct a Fake
Chinese Trademark dataset (FCTM). Through a series of experiments, we show that
the proposed CTP-Net is able to capture tampering traces in document images,
especially in text regions. Experimental results demonstrate that CTP-Net can
localize multi-scale forged areas in document images and outperform the
state-of-the-art forgery localization methods.

<p class="mathjax">The media localization industry usually requires a verbatim script of the
final film or TV production in order to create subtitles or dubbing scripts in
a foreign language. In particular, the verbatim script (i.e. as-broadcast
script) must be structured into a sequence of dialogue lines each including
time codes, speaker name and transcript. Current speech recognition technology
alleviates the transcription step. However, state-of-the-art speaker
diarization models still fall short on TV shows for two main reasons: (i) their
inability to track a large number of speakers, (ii) their low accuracy in
detecting frequent speaker changes. To mitigate this problem, we present a
novel approach to leverage production scripts used during the shooting process,
to extract pseudo-labeled data for the speaker diarization task. We propose a
novel semi-supervised approach and demonstrate improvements of 51.7% relative
to two unsupervised baseline models on our metrics on a 66 show test set.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, vision Transformers (ViTs) have been actively applied to
fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR). ViT can effectively model the
interdependencies between patch-divided object regions through an inherent
self-attention mechanism. In addition, patch selection is used with ViT to
remove redundant patch information and highlight the most discriminative object
patches. However, existing ViT-based FGVR models are limited to single-scale
processing, and their fixed receptive fields hinder representational richness
and exacerbate vulnerability to scale variability. Therefore, we propose
multi-scale patch selection (MSPS) to improve the multi-scale capabilities of
existing ViT-based models. Specifically, MSPS selects salient patches of
different scales at different stages of a multi-scale vision Transformer
(MS-ViT). In addition, we introduce class token transfer (CTT) and multi-scale
cross-attention (MSCA) to model cross-scale interactions between selected
multi-scale patches and fully reflect them in model decisions. Compared to
previous single-scale patch selection (SSPS), our proposed MSPS encourages
richer object representations based on feature hierarchy and consistently
improves performance from small-sized to large-sized objects. As a result, we
propose M2Former, which outperforms CNN-/ViT-based models on several widely
used FGVR benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is a task that aims to segment the
target object in all video frames based on a sentence describing the object.
Previous RVOS methods have achieved significant performance with
densely-annotated datasets, whose construction is expensive and time-consuming.
To relieve the burden of data annotation while maintaining sufficient
supervision for segmentation, we propose a new annotation scheme, in which we
label the frame where the object first appears with a mask and use bounding
boxes for the subsequent frames. Based on this scheme, we propose a method to
learn from this weak annotation. Specifically, we design a cross frame
segmentation method, which uses the language-guided dynamic filters to
thoroughly leverage the valuable mask annotation and bounding boxes. We further
develop a bi-level contrastive learning method to encourage the model to learn
discriminative representation at the pixel level. Extensive experiments and
ablative analyses show that our method is able to achieve competitive
performance without the demand of dense mask annotation. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wangbo-zhao/WRVOS/.

<p class="mathjax">By enabling users to safely transfer digital tokens without trusted
intermediaries, blockchains have fueled the rise of Decentralized Finance
(DeFi). However, the current DeFi ecosystem consists of multiple independent
blockchains, and cross-chain token trading is a challenge because the desirable
properties of individual blockchains do not always generalize to a multi-chain
setting. Recently, advances have been made in the generalization of these
properties, but there is still a lack of an overarching framework that provides
the full set of properties required for practical cross-chain commerce:
transaction atomicity, stablecoin support, privacy-preserving digital
identities, and general applicability.
<br />In this paper, we present BlockChain I/O to provide such a framework.
BlockChain I/O uses entities called cross-chain services to relay information
between different chains. Cross-chain services cannot violate transaction
atomicity, and are disincentivized from other types of misbehavior -- i.e.,
causing delays or misrepresenting information -- through an audit system.
BlockChain I/O uses stablecoins to mitigate price fluctuations, and a Digital
ID system to allow users to prove aspects of their identity without violating
privacy. After presenting the core architecture of BlockChain I/O, we
demonstrate how to use it to implement a cross-chain marketplace. Finally, we
use an experimental evaluation to demonstrate BlockChain I/O's practical
performance.

<p class="mathjax">The crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) is a machine learning
model that leverages score matching to generate realistic crystal structures
that preserve crystal symmetry. In this study, we leverage novel diffusion
probabilistic (DP) models to denoise atomic coordinates rather than adopting
the standard score matching approach in CDVAE. Our proposed DP-CDVAE model can
reconstruct and generate crystal structures whose qualities are statistically
comparable to those of the original CDVAE. Furthermore, notably, when comparing
the carbon structures generated by the DP-CDVAE model with relaxed structures
obtained from density functional theory calculations, we find that the DP-CDVAE
generated structures are remarkably closer to their respective ground states.
The energy differences between these structures and the true ground states are,
on average, 68.1 meV/atom lower than those generated by the original CDVAE.
This significant improvement in the energy accuracy highlights the
effectiveness of the DP-CDVAE model in generating crystal structures that
better represent their ground-state configurations.

paper introduces a novel deep learning transformer-based architecture
specifically tailored for denoising mechanical vibration signals. The model
leverages a Multi-Head Attention layer with 8 heads, processing input sequences
of length 128, embedded into a 64-dimensional space. The architecture also
incorporates Feed-Forward Neural Networks, Layer Normalization, and Residual

remarkable effectiveness in filtering out noise while preserving critical

<p class="mathjax">The future Six-Generation (6G) envisions massive access of wireless devices
in the network, leading to more serious interference from concurrent
transmissions between wireless devices in the same frequency band. Existing
interference mitigation approaches takes the interference signals as Gaussian
white noise, which cannot precisely estimate the non-Gaussian interference
signals from other devices. In this paper, we present IntLearner, a new
interference mitigation technique that estimates and mitigates the impact of
interference signals with only physical-layer (PHY) information available in
base-station (BS) and user-equipment (UE), including channel estimator and
constellations. More specifically, IntLearner utilizes the power of AI to
estimate the features in interference signals, and removes the interference
from the interfered received signal with neural network (NN). IntLearner's NN
adopts a modular NN design, which takes the domain knowledge of BS and UE PHY
as the guidance to NN design for minimizing training confusion and NN
complexity. Simulation results show IntLearner increases Uplink (UL) channel
estimation accuracy up to 7.4x, and reduces the Downlink (DL) Signal to
Interference Ratio plus Noise Ratio (SINR) requirement to achieve the same
Block Error Rate (BLER) by 1.5dB in a conventional multi-cell scenario.

<p class="mathjax">Whilst deep learning techniques have achieved excellent emotion prediction,
they still require large amounts of labelled training data, which are (a)
onerous and tedious to compile, and (b) prone to errors and biases. We propose
Multi-Task Contrastive Learning for Affect Representation (\textbf{MT-CLAR})
for few-shot affect inference. MT-CLAR combines multi-task learning with a
Siamese network trained via contrastive learning to infer from a pair of
expressive facial images (a) the (dis)similarity between the facial
expressions, and (b) the difference in valence and arousal levels of the two
faces. We further extend the image-based MT-CLAR framework for automated video
labelling where, given one or a few labelled video frames (termed
\textit{support-set}), MT-CLAR labels the remainder of the video for valence
and arousal. Experiments are performed on the AFEW-VA dataset with multiple
support-set configurations; moreover, supervised learning on representations
learnt via MT-CLAR are used for valence, arousal and categorical emotion
prediction on the AffectNet and AFEW-VA datasets. The results show that valence
and arousal predictions via MT-CLAR are very comparable to the state-of-the-art
(SOTA), and we significantly outperform SOTA with a support-set $\approx$6\%
the size of the video dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Augmenting automated vehicles to wirelessly detect and respond to external
events before they are detectable by onboard sensors is crucial for developing
context-aware driving strategies. To this end, we present an automated vehicle
platform, designed with connectivity, ease of use and modularity in mind, both
in hardware and software. It is based on the Kia Soul EV with a modified
version of the Open-Source Car Control (OSCC) drive-by-wire module, uses the
open-source Robot Operating System (ROS and ROS 2) in its software
architecture, and provides a straightforward solution for transitioning from
simulations to real-world tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
platform through a synchronised driving test, where sensor data is exchanged
wirelessly, and a model-predictive controller is used to actuate the automated
vehicle.

<p class="mathjax">Affordance learning considers the interaction opportunities for an actor in
the scene and thus has wide application in scene understanding and intelligent
robotics. In this paper, we focus on contextual affordance learning, i.e.,
using affordance as context to generate a reasonable human pose in a scene.
Existing scene-aware human pose generation methods could be divided into two
categories depending on whether using pose templates. Our proposed method
belongs to the template-based category, which benefits from the representative
pose templates. Moreover, inspired by recent transformer-based methods, we
associate each query embedding with a pose template, and use the interaction
between query embeddings and scene feature map to effectively predict the scale
and offsets for each pose template. In addition, we employ knowledge
distillation to facilitate the offset learning given the predicted scale.
Comprehensive experiments on Sitcom dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

<p class="mathjax">Clinical trial matching is a key process in health delivery and discovery. In
practice, it is plagued by overwhelming unstructured data and unscalable manual
processing. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on scaling clinical
trial matching using large language models (LLMs), with oncology as the focus
area. Our study is grounded in a clinical trial matching system currently in
test deployment at a large U.S. health network. Initial findings are promising:
out of box, cutting-edge LLMs, such as GPT-4, can already structure elaborate
eligibility criteria of clinical trials and extract complex matching logic
(e.g., nested AND/OR/NOT). While still far from perfect, LLMs substantially
outperform prior strong baselines and may serve as a preliminary solution to
help triage patient-trial candidates with humans in the loop. Our study also
reveals a few significant growth areas for applying LLMs to end-to-end clinical
trial matching, such as context limitation and accuracy, especially in
structuring patient information from longitudinal medical records.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied to encrypted network traffic
classification in experimental settings. However, in production use, it has
been shown that a DL classifier's performance inevitably decays over time.
Re-training the model on newer datasets has been shown to only partially
improve its performance. Manually re-tuning the model architecture to meet the
performance expectations on newer datasets is time-consuming and requires
domain expertise. We propose AutoML4ETC, a novel tool to automatically design
efficient and high-performing neural architectures for encrypted traffic
classification. We define a novel, powerful search space tailored specifically
for the near real-time classification of encrypted traffic using packet header
bytes. We show that with different search strategies over our search space,
AutoML4ETC generates neural architectures that outperform the state-of-the-art
encrypted traffic classifiers on several datasets, including public benchmark
datasets and real-world TLS and QUIC traffic collected from the Orange mobile
network. In addition to being more accurate, AutoML4ETC's architectures are
significantly more efficient and lighter in terms of the number of parameters.
Finally, we make AutoML4ETC publicly available for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection, or outlier detection, is a crucial task in various domains
to identify instances that significantly deviate from established patterns or
the majority of data. In the context of autonomous driving, the identification
of anomalies is particularly important to prevent safety-critical incidents, as
deep learning models often exhibit overconfidence in anomalous or outlier
samples. In this study, we explore different strategies for training an image
semantic segmentation model with an anomaly detection module. By introducing
modifications to the training stage of the state-of-the-art DenseHybrid model,
we achieve significant performance improvements in anomaly detection. Moreover,
we propose a simplified detector that achieves comparable results to our
modified DenseHybrid approach, while also surpassing the performance of the
original DenseHybrid model. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed strategies for enhancing anomaly detection in the context of
autonomous driving.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a popular technique that aims to
reduce the domain shift between two data distributions. It was successfully
applied in computer vision and natural language processing. In the current
work, we explore the effects of various unsupervised domain adaptation
techniques between two text classification tasks: fake and hyperpartisan news
detection. We investigate the knowledge transfer from fake to hyperpartisan
news detection without involving target labels during training. Thus, we
evaluate UDA, cluster alignment with a teacher, and cross-domain contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments show that these techniques improve performance,
while including data augmentation further enhances the results. In addition, we
combine clustering and topic modeling algorithms with UDA, resulting in
improved performances compared to the initial UDA setup.

<p class="mathjax">When developing high-speed and high-precision CNC machine tools, subsystem
coupling effects must be considered while designing the feed system to maximize
its dynamic performance. Currently, the influence of changes in control
parameters on the matching characteristics of each subsystem was not yet
considered when studying the coupling relationship between subsystems.
Therefore, it is difficult to define the law of action between subsystems under
the interference of control parameters. Hence, a new method was proposed in
this paper aiming to isolate the disturbance of control parameters and to
highlight the actions between electromechanical subsystems. This was achieved
by optimizing the servo control parameters for each configuration of
electromechanical parameters, ensuring that the feed system performance is
optimal for the observed configuration. This approach eliminated the influence
of the control subsystem on the electromechanical coupling relationship. The
approach effectiveness was verified via the integrated model of the feed
system. As such, this paper provides a reliable method to further study the
coupling mechanism of subsystems, revealing the mechanism behind the dynamic
design of feed systems.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new framework for the analysis of preprocessing routines for
parameterized counting problems. Existing frameworks that encapsulate
parameterized counting problems permit the usage of exponential (rather than
polynomial) time either explicitly or by implicitly reducing the counting
problems to enumeration problems. Thus, our framework is the only one in the
spirit of classic kernelization (as well as lossy kernelization). Specifically,
we define a compression of a counting problem $P$ into a counting problem $Q$
as a pair of polynomial-time procedures: $\mathsf{reduce}$ and $\mathsf{lift}$.
Given an instance of $P$, $\mathsf{reduce}$ outputs an instance of $Q$ whose
size is bounded by a function $f$ of the parameter, and given the number of
solutions to the instance of $Q$, $\mathsf{lift}$ outputs the number of
solutions to the instance of $P$. When $P=Q$, compression is termed
kernelization, and when $f$ is polynomial, compression is termed polynomial
compression. Our technical (and other conceptual) contributions concern both
upper bounds and lower bounds.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) seeks to generalize the ability
of inferring speech emotion from a well-labeled corpus to an unlabeled one,
which is a rather challenging task due to the significant discrepancy between
two corpora. Existing methods, typically based on unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA), struggle to learn corpus-invariant features by global
distribution alignment, but unfortunately, the resulting features are mixed
with corpus-specific features or not class-discriminative. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel Emotion Decoupling aNd Alignment learning
framework (EMO-DNA) for cross-corpus SER, a novel UDA method to learn
emotion-relevant corpus-invariant features. The novelties of EMO-DNA are
two-fold: contrastive emotion decoupling and dual-level emotion alignment. On
one hand, our contrastive emotion decoupling achieves decoupling learning via a
contrastive decoupling loss to strengthen the separability of emotion-relevant
features from corpus-specific ones. On the other hand, our dual-level emotion
alignment introduces an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling to select confident
target samples for class-level alignment, and performs corpus-level alignment
to jointly guide model for learning class-discriminative corpus-invariant
features across corpora. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of EMO-DNA over the state-of-the-art methods in several
cross-corpus scenarios. Source code is available at
https://github.com/Jiaxin-Ye/Emo-DNA.

<p class="mathjax">Compared to the multi-stage self-supervised multi-view stereo (MVS) method,
the end-to-end (E2E) approach has received more attention due to its concise
and efficient training pipeline. Recent E2E self-supervised MVS approaches have
integrated third-party models (such as optical flow models, semantic
segmentation models, NeRF models, etc.) to provide additional consistency
constraints, which grows GPU memory consumption and complicates the model's
structure and training pipeline. In this work, we propose an efficient
framework for end-to-end self-supervised MVS, dubbed ES-MVSNet. To alleviate
the high memory consumption of current E2E self-supervised MVS frameworks, we
present a memory-efficient architecture that reduces memory usage by 43%
without compromising model performance. Furthermore, with the novel design of
asymmetric view selection policy and region-aware depth consistency, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance among E2E self-supervised MVS methods, without
relying on third-party models for additional consistency signals. Extensive
experiments on DTU and Tanks&amp;Temples benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
ES-MVSNet approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among E2E
self-supervised MVS methods and competitive performance to many supervised and
multi-stage self-supervised methods.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the development of large pretrained language models, such as
BERT and GPT, significantly improved information extraction systems on various
tasks, including relation classification. State-of-the-art systems are highly
accurate on scientific benchmarks. A lack of explainability is currently a
complicating factor in many real-world applications. Comprehensible systems are
necessary to prevent biased, counterintuitive, or harmful decisions.
<br />We introduce semantic extents, a concept to analyze decision patterns for the
relation classification task. Semantic extents are the most influential parts
of texts concerning classification decisions. Our definition allows similar
procedures to determine semantic extents for humans and models. We provide an
annotation tool and a software framework to determine semantic extents for
humans and models conveniently and reproducibly. Comparing both reveals that
models tend to learn shortcut patterns from data. These patterns are hard to
detect with current interpretability methods, such as input reductions. Our
approach can help detect and eliminate spurious decision patterns during model
development. Semantic extents can increase the reliability and security of
natural language processing systems. Semantic extents are an essential step in
enabling applications in critical areas like healthcare or finance. Moreover,
our work opens new research directions for developing methods to explain deep
learning models.

<p class="mathjax">Direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware
has the potential to significantly reduce the high energy consumption of
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) training on modern computers. The biological
plausibility of SNNs allows them to benefit from bio-inspired plasticity rules,
such as Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). STDP offers gradient-free and
unsupervised local learning, which can be easily implemented on neuromorphic
hardware. However, relying solely on unsupervised STDP to perform
classification tasks is not enough. In this paper, we propose Stabilized
Supervised STDP (S2-STDP), a supervised STDP learning rule to train the
classification layer of an SNN equipped with unsupervised STDP. S2-STDP
integrates error-modulated weight updates that align neuron spikes with desired
timestamps derived from the average firing time within the layer. Then, we
introduce a training architecture called Paired Competing Neurons (PCN) to
further enhance the learning capabilities of our classification layer trained
with S2-STDP. PCN associates each class with paired neurons and encourages
neuron specialization through intra-class competition. We evaluated our
proposed methods on image recognition datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,
and CIFAR-10. Results showed that our methods outperform current supervised
STDP-based state of the art, for comparable architectures and numbers of
neurons. Also, the use of PCN enhances the performance of S2-STDP, regardless
of the configuration, and without introducing any hyperparameters.Further
analysis demonstrated that our methods exhibited improved hyperparameter
robustness, which reduces the need for tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) create, share and process
massive amounts of data which needs to be real-time managed to enable new
cooperative and autonomous driving applications. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communications facilitate information exchange among vehicles and
infrastructures using various protocols. By providing computer power, data
storage, and low latency capabilities, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has
become a key enabling technology in the transport industry. The Local Dynamic
Map (LDM) concept has consequently been extended to its utilisation in MECs,
into an efficient, collaborative, and centralised Edge Dynamic Map (EDM) for
C-ITS applications. This research presents an EDM architecture for V2X
communications and implements a real-time proof-of-concept using a Time-Series
Database (TSDB) engine to store vehicular message information. The performance
evaluation includes data insertion and querying, assessing the system's
capacity and scale for low-latency Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM)
applications. Traffic simulations using SUMO have been employed to generate
virtual routes for thousands of vehicles, demonstrating the transmission of
virtual CAM messages to the EDM.

<p class="mathjax">Underground gas storage (UGS) is a worldwide well-established technology that
is becoming even more important to cope with seasonal peaks of gas consumption
due to the growing uncertainties of the energy market. Safety issues concerning
the reactivation of pre-existing faults might arise if the target reservoir is
located in a faulted basin, where human activities can trigger
(micro-)seismicity events. In the Netherlands, it has been observed that fault
activation can occur somehow "unexpectedly" after the primary production (PP),
i.e., during cushion gas injection (CGI) and UGS cycles, when the stress regime
should be in the unloading/reloading path. To understand the physical
mechanisms responsible for such occurrences, a 3D mathematical model coupling
frictional contact mechanics in faulted porous rocks with fluid flow is
developed, implemented and tested. The final aim of this two-part work is to
define a safe operational bandwidth for the pore pressure range for UGS
activities in the faulted reservoirs of the Rotliegend formation. Part I of
this work concerns the development of the mathematical and numerical model of
frictional contact mechanics and flow in faulted porous rocks. A mixed
discretization of the governing PDEs under frictional contact constraints along
the faults is used. A slip-weakening constitutive law governing the fault
macroscopic behavior is also presented. The model is tested in the setting of
an ideal reservoir located in the Rotliegend formation. The analyses point out
how fault reactivation during PP can lead to a stress redistribution, giving
rise to a new equilibrium configuration. When the fault is reloaded in the
opposite direction during the CGI and/or UGS stages, further activation events
can occur even if the stress range does not exceed either the undisturbed
initial value or the maximum strength ever experienced by the formation.

<p class="mathjax">The paper presents a strategy for robotic exploration problems using
Space-Filling curves (SFC). The region of interest is first tessellated, and
the tiles/cells are connected using some SFC. A robot follows the SFC to
explore the entire area. However, there could be obstacles that block the
systematic movement of the robot. We overcome this problem by providing an
evading technique that avoids the blocked tiles while ensuring all the free
ones are visited at least once. The proposed strategy is online, implying that
prior knowledge of the obstacles is not mandatory. It works for all SFCs, but
for the sake of demonstration, we use Hilbert curve. We present the
completeness of the algorithm and discuss its desirable properties with
examples. We also address the non-uniform coverage problem using our strategy.

<p class="mathjax">Trolls, bots, and sybils distort online discourse and compromise the security
of networked platforms. User identity is central to the vectors of attack and
manipulation employed in these contexts. However it has long seemed that, try
as it might, the security community has been unable to stem the rising tide of
such problems. We posit the Ghost Trilemma, that there are three key properties
of identity -- sentience, location, and uniqueness -- that cannot be
simultaneously verified in a fully-decentralized setting. Many
fully-decentralized systems -- whether for communication or social coordination
-- grapple with this trilemma in some way, perhaps unknowingly. We examine the
design space, use cases, problems with prior approaches, and possible paths
forward. We sketch a proof of this trilemma and outline options for practical,
incrementally deployable schemes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff of trust in
centralized trust anchors, decentralized operation, and an ability to withstand
a range of attacks, while protecting user privacy.

<p class="mathjax">The hybridization process has recently touched also the world of agricultural
vehicles. Within this context, we develop an Energy Management Strategy (EMS)
aiming at optimizing fuel consumption, while maintaining the battery state of
charge. A typical feature of agricultural machines is that their internal
combustion engine is speed controlled, tracking the reference requested by the
driver. In view of avoiding any modification on this original control loop, an
add-on EMS strategy is proposed. In particular, we employ a multi-objective
Model Predictive Control (MPC), taking into account the fuel consumption
minimization and the speed tracking requirement, including the engine speed
controller in the predictive model. The proposed MPC is tested in an
experimentally-validated simulation environment, representative of an orchard

<p class="mathjax">Recommender Systems are built to retrieve relevant items to satisfy users'
information needs. The candidate corpus usually consists of a finite set of
items that are ready to be served, such as videos, products, or articles. With
recent advances in Generative AI such as GPT and Diffusion models, a new form
of recommendation task is yet to be explored where items are to be created by
generative models with personalized prompts. Taking image generation as an
example, with a single prompt from the user and access to a generative model,
it is possible to generate hundreds of new images in a few minutes. How shall
we attain personalization in the presence of "infinite" items? In this
preliminary study, we propose a two-stage framework, namely Prompt-Model
Retrieval and Generated Item Ranking, to approach this new task formulation. We
release GEMRec-18K, a prompt-model interaction dataset with 18K images
generated by 200 publicly-available generative models paired with a diverse set
of 90 textual prompts. Our findings demonstrate the promise of generative model
recommendation as a novel personalization problem and the limitations of
existing evaluation metrics. We highlight future directions for the RecSys
community to advance towards generative recommender systems. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/MAPS-research/GEMRec.

<p class="mathjax">Secure Aggregation (SA) is a key component of privacy-friendly federated
learning applications, where the server learns the sum of many user-supplied
gradients, while individual gradients are kept private. State-of-the-art SA
protocols protect individual inputs with zero-sum random shares that are
distributed across users, have a per-user overhead that is logarithmic in the
number of users, and take more than 5 rounds of interaction. In this paper, we
introduce LISA, an SA protocol that leverages a source of public randomness to
minimize per-user overhead and the number of rounds. In particular, LISA
requires only two rounds and has a communication overhead that is
asymptotically equal to that of a non-private protocol -- one where inputs are
provided to the server in the clear -- for most of the users. In a nutshell,
LISA uses public randomness to select a subset of the users -- a committee --
that aid the server to recover the aggregated input. Users blind their
individual contributions with randomness shared with each of the committee
members; each committee member provides the server with an aggregate of the
randomness shared with each user. Hence, as long as one committee member is
honest, the server cannot learn individual inputs but only the sum of
threshold-many inputs. We compare LISA with state-of-the-art SA protocols both
theoretically and by means of simulations and present results of our
experiments. We also integrate LISA in a Federated Learning pipeline and
compare its performance with a non-private protocol.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperauthorship, a phenomenon whereby there are a disproportionately large
number of authors on a single paper, is increasingly common in several
scientific disciplines, but with unknown consequences for network metrics used
to study scientific collaboration. The validity of co-authorship as a proxy for
scientific collaboration is affected by this. Using bibliometric data from
publications in the field of genomics, we examine the impact of hyperauthorship
on metrics of scientific collaboration, and propose a method to determine a
suitable cutoff threshold for hyperauthored papers and compare co-authorship
networks with and without hyperauthored works. Our analysis reveals that
including hyperauthored papers dramatically impacts the structural positioning
of central authors and the topological characteristics of the network, while
producing small influences on whole-network cohesion measures. We present two
solutions to minimize the impact of hyperauthorship: using a mathematically
grounded and reproducible calculation of threshold cutoff to exclude
hyperauthored papers or fractional counting to weight network results. Our
findings affirm the structural influences of hyperauthored papers and suggest
that scholars should be mindful when using co-authorship networks to study
scientific collaboration.

<p class="mathjax">Conventional detectors suffer from performance degradation when dealing with
long-tailed data due to a classification bias towards the majority head
categories. In this paper, we contend that the learning bias originates from
two factors: 1) the unequal competition arising from the imbalanced
distribution of foreground categories, and 2) the lack of sample diversity in
tail categories. To tackle these issues, we introduce a unified framework
called BAlanced CLassification (BACL), which enables adaptive rectification of
inequalities caused by disparities in category distribution and dynamic
intensification of sample diversities in a synchronized manner. Specifically, a
novel foreground classification balance loss (FCBL) is developed to ameliorate
the domination of head categories and shift attention to
difficult-to-differentiate categories by introducing pairwise class-aware
margins and auto-adjusted weight terms, respectively. This loss prevents the
over-suppression of tail categories in the context of unequal competition.
Moreover, we propose a dynamic feature hallucination module (FHM), which
enhances the representation of tail categories in the feature space by
synthesizing hallucinated samples to introduce additional data variances. In
this divide-and-conquer approach, BACL sets a new state-of-the-art on the
challenging LVIS benchmark with a decoupled training pipeline, surpassing
vanilla Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50-FPN by 5.8% AP and 16.1% AP for overall and
tail categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BACL consistently
achieves performance improvements across various datasets with different
backbones and architectures. Code and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">Restrictive rules for data sharing in many industries have led to the
development of \ac{FL}. \ac{FL} is a \ac{ML} technique that allows distributed
clients to train models collaboratively without the need to share their
respective training data with others. In this article, we first explore the
technical basics of FL and its potential applications. Second, we present a
conceptual framework for the adoption of \ac{FL}, mapping organizations along
the lines of their \ac{AI} capabilities and environment. We then discuss why
exemplary organizations in different industries, including industry consortia,
established banks, public authorities, and data-intensive SMEs might consider
different approaches to \ac{FL}. To conclude, we argue that \ac{FL} presents an
institutional shift with ample interdisciplinary research opportunities for the

<p class="mathjax">Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to sequence generation models enables
the direct optimization of long-term rewards (\textit{e.g.,} BLEU and human
feedback), but typically requires large-scale sampling over a space of action
sequences. This is a computational challenge as presented by the practice of
sequence generation problems, such as machine translation, where we often deal
with a large action space (\textit{e.g.,} a vocabulary) and a long action
sequence (\textit{e.g.,} a translation). In this work, we introduce two-stage
sampling and dynamic sampling approaches to improve the sampling efficiency
during training sequence generation models via RL. We experiment with our
approaches on the traditional sequence generation tasks, including machine
translation and abstractive summarization. Furthermore, we evaluate our
approaches in RL from human feedback (RLHF) through training a large language
model using the reward model. Experimental results show that the efficient
sampling-based RL, referred to as ESRL, can outperform all baselines in terms
of both training efficiency and memory consumption. Notably, ESRL yields
consistent performance gains over the strong REINFORCE, minimum risk training,
and proximal policy optimization methods.

<p class="mathjax">Discovering ancient agricultural terraces in desert regions is important for
the monitoring of long-term climate changes on the Earth's surface. However,
traditional ground surveys are both costly and limited in scale. With the
increasing accessibility of aerial and satellite data, machine learning
techniques bear large potential for the automatic detection and recognition of
archaeological landscapes. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic model
fusion method for ancient agricultural terrace detection. The input data
includes aerial images and LiDAR generated terrain features in the Negev
desert. Two deep semantic segmentation models, namely DeepLabv3+ and UNet, with
EfficientNet backbone, are trained and fused to provide segmentation maps of
ancient terraces and walls. The proposed method won the first prize in the
International AI Archaeology Challenge. Codes are available at
https://github.com/wangyi111/international-archaeology-ai-challenge.

<p class="mathjax">While sentence simplification is an active research topic in NLP, its
adjacent tasks of sentence complexification and same-level paraphrasing are
not. To train models on all three tasks, we present two new unsupervised
datasets. We compare these datasets, one labeled by a weak classifier and the
other by a rule-based approach, with a single supervised dataset. Using these
three datasets for training, we perform extensive experiments on both
multitasking and prompting strategies. Compared to other systems trained on
unsupervised parallel data, models trained on our weak classifier labeled
dataset achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ASSET simplification
benchmark. Our models also outperform previous work on sentence level
targeting. Finally, we establish how a handful of Large Language Models perform
on these tasks under a zero-shot setting.

<p class="mathjax">Several learnable image encryption schemes have been developed for
privacy-preserving image classification. This paper focuses on the security
block-based image encryption methods that are learnable and JPEG-friendly.
Permuting divided blocks in an image is known to enhance robustness against
ciphertext-only attacks (COAs), but recently jigsaw puzzle solver attacks have
been demonstrated to be able to restore visual information on the encrypted
images. In contrast, it has never been confirmed whether encrypted images
including noise caused by JPEG-compression are robust. Accordingly, the aim of
this paper is to evaluate the security of compressible and learnable encrypted
images against jigsaw puzzle solver attacks. In experiments, the security
evaluation was carried out on the CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets under
JPEG-compression.

<p class="mathjax">Painterly image harmonization aims to insert photographic objects into
paintings and obtain artistically coherent composite images. Previous methods
for this task mainly rely on inference optimization or generative adversarial
network, but they are either very time-consuming or struggling at fine control
of the foreground objects (e.g., texture and content details). To address these
issues, we propose a novel Painterly Harmonization stable Diffusion model
(PHDiffusion), which includes a lightweight adaptive encoder and a Dual Encoder
Fusion (DEF) module. Specifically, the adaptive encoder and the DEF module
first stylize foreground features within each encoder. Then, the stylized
foreground features from both encoders are combined to guide the harmonization
process. During training, besides the noise loss in diffusion model, we
additionally employ content loss and two style losses, i.e., AdaIN style loss
and contrastive style loss, aiming to balance the trade-off between style
migration and content preservation. Compared with the state-of-the-art models
from related fields, our PHDiffusion can stylize the foreground more
sufficiently and simultaneously retain finer content. Our code and model are
available at https://github.com/bcmi/PHDiffusion-Painterly-Image-Harmonization.

<p class="mathjax">Parallel datasets are vital for performing and evaluating any kind of
multilingual task. However, in the cases where one of the considered language
pairs is a low-resource language, the existing top-down parallel data such as
corpora are lacking in both tally and quality due to the dearth of human
annotation. Therefore, for low-resource languages, it is more feasible to move
in the bottom-up direction where finer granular pairs such as dictionary
datasets are developed first. They may then be used for mid-level tasks such as
supervised multilingual word embedding alignment. These in turn can later guide
higher-level tasks in the order of aligning sentence or paragraph text corpora
used for Machine Translation (MT). Even though more approachable than
generating and aligning a massive corpus for a low-resource language, for the
same reason of apathy from larger research entities, even these finer granular
data sets are lacking for some low-resource languages. We have observed that
there is no free and open dictionary data set for the low-resource language,
Sinhala. Thus, in this work, we introduce three parallel English-Sinhala word
dictionaries (En-Si-dict-large, En-Si-dict-filtered, En-Si-dict-FastText) which
help in multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to English
and Sinhala languages. In this paper, we explain the dataset creation pipeline
as well as the experimental results of the tests we have carried out to verify
the quality of the data sets. The data sets and the related scripts are
available at https://github.com/kasunw22/sinhala-para-dict.

<p class="mathjax">In many applications, piecewise continuous functions are commonly
interpolated over meshes. However, accurate high-order manipulations of such
functions can be challenging due to potential spurious oscillations known as
the Gibbs phenomena. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach,
Robust Discontinuity Indicators (RDI), which can efficiently and reliably
detect both C^{0} and C^{1} discontinuities for node-based and cell-averaged
values. We present a detailed analysis focusing on its derivation and the
dual-thresholding strategy. A key advantage of RDI is its ability to handle
potential inaccuracies associated with detecting discontinuities on non-uniform
meshes, thanks to its innovative discontinuity indicators. We also extend the
applicability of RDI to handle general surfaces with boundaries, features, and
ridge points, thereby enhancing its versatility and usefulness in various
scenarios. To demonstrate the robustness of RDI, we conduct a series of
experiments on non-uniform meshes and general surfaces, and compare its
performance with some alternative methods. By addressing the challenges posed
by the Gibbs phenomena and providing reliable detection of discontinuities, RDI
opens up possibilities for improved approximation and analysis of piecewise
continuous functions, such as in data remap.

<p class="mathjax">View Transformation Module (VTM), where transformations happen between
multi-view image features and Bird-Eye-View (BEV) representation, is a crucial
step in camera-based BEV perception systems. Currently, the two most prominent
VTM paradigms are forward projection and backward projection. Forward
projection, represented by Lift-Splat-Shoot, leads to sparsely projected BEV
features without post-processing. Backward projection, with BEVFormer being an
example, tends to generate false-positive BEV features from incorrect
projections due to the lack of utilization on depth. To address the above
limitations, we propose a novel forward-backward view transformation module.
Our approach compensates for the deficiencies in both existing methods,
allowing them to enhance each other to obtain higher quality BEV
representations mutually. We instantiate the proposed module with FB-BEV, which
achieves a new state-of-the-art result of 62.4\% NDS on the nuScenes test set.
The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/NVlabs/FB-BEV}.

methods for normal estimation perform well in regions where normals change
slowly, they tend to fail where normals vary rapidly. To address this issue, we
propose a novel approach called MSECNet, which improves estimation in normal
varying regions by treating normal variation modeling as an edge detection
problem. MSECNet consists of a backbone network and a multi-scale edge
conditioning (MSEC) stream. The MSEC stream achieves robust edge detection
through multi-scale feature fusion and adaptive edge detection. The detected
edges are then combined with the output of the backbone network using the edge
conditioning module to produce edge-aware representations. Extensive
experiments show that MSECNet outperforms existing methods on both synthetic
(PCPNet) and real-world (SceneNN) datasets while running significantly faster.
We also conduct various analyses to investigate the contribution of each
component in the MSEC stream. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in surface reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating 6D poses and reconstructing 3D shapes of objects in open-world
scenes from RGB-depth image pairs is challenging. Many existing methods rely on
learning geometric features that correspond to specific templates while
disregarding shape variations and pose differences among objects in the same
category. As a result, these methods underperform when handling unseen object
instances in complex environments. In contrast, other approaches aim to achieve
category-level estimation and reconstruction by leveraging normalized geometric
structure priors, but the static prior-based reconstruction struggles with
substantial intra-class variations. To solve these problems, we propose the
DTF-Net, a novel framework for pose estimation and shape reconstruction based
on implicit neural fields of object categories. In DTF-Net, we design a
deformable template field to represent the general category-wise shape latent
features and intra-category geometric deformation features. The field
establishes continuous shape correspondences, deforming the category template
into arbitrary observed instances to accomplish shape reconstruction. We
introduce a pose regression module that shares the deformation features and
template codes from the fields to estimate the accurate 6D pose of each object
in the scene. We integrate a multi-modal representation extraction module to
extract object features and semantic masks, enabling end-to-end inference.
Moreover, during training, we implement a shape-invariant training strategy and
a viewpoint sampling method to further enhance the model's capability to
extract object pose features. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 and CAMERA25
datasets demonstrate the superiority of DTF-Net in both synthetic and real
scenes. Furthermore, we show that DTF-Net effectively supports grasping tasks
with a real robot arm.

<p class="mathjax">This article introduces a novel lightweight framework using ambient
backscattering communications to counter eavesdroppers. In particular, our
framework divides an original message into two parts: (i) the active-transmit
message transmitted by the transmitter using conventional RF signals and (ii)
the backscatter message transmitted by an ambient backscatter tag that
backscatters upon the active signals emitted by the transmitter. Notably, the
backscatter tag does not generate its own signal, making it difficult for an
eavesdropper to detect the backscattered signals unless they have prior
knowledge of the system. Here, we assume that without decoding/knowing the
backscatter message, the eavesdropper is unable to decode the original message.
Even in scenarios where the eavesdropper can capture both messages,
reconstructing the original message is a complex task without understanding the
intricacies of the message-splitting mechanism. A challenge in our proposed
framework is to effectively decode the backscattered signals at the receiver,
often accomplished using the maximum likelihood (MLK) approach. However, such a
method may require a complex mathematical model together with perfect channel
state information (CSI). To address this issue, we develop a novel deep
meta-learning-based signal detector that can not only effectively decode the
weak backscattered signals without requiring perfect CSI but also quickly adapt
to a new wireless environment with very little knowledge. Simulation results
show that our proposed learning approach, without requiring perfect CSI and
complex mathematical model, can achieve a bit error ratio close to that of the
MLK-based approach. They also clearly show the efficiency of the proposed
approach in dealing with eavesdropping attacks and the lack of training data
for deep learning models in practical scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">The confidence calibration of deep learning-based perception models plays a
crucial role in their reliability. Especially in the context of autonomous
driving, downstream tasks like prediction and planning depend on accurate
confidence estimates. In point-wise multiclass classification tasks like
sematic segmentation the model has to deal with heavy class imbalances. Due to
their underrepresentation, the confidence calibration of classes with smaller
instances is challenging but essential, not only for safety reasons. We propose
a metric to measure the confidence calibration quality of a semantic
segmentation model with respect to individual classes. It is calculated by
computing sparsification curves for each class based on the uncertainty
estimates. We use the classification calibration metric to evaluate uncertainty
estimation methods with respect to their confidence calibration of
underrepresented classes. We furthermore suggest a double use for the method to
automatically find label problems to improve the quality of hand- or
auto-annotated datasets.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a computational analysis of the field recording
dataset of approximately 700 hours of Korean folk songs, which were recorded
around 1980-90s. Because most of the songs were sung by non-expert musicians
without accompaniment, the dataset provides several challenges. To address this
challenge, we utilized self-supervised learning with convolutional neural
network based on pitch contour, then analyzed how the musical concept of tori,
a classification system defined by a specific scale, ornamental notes, and an
idiomatic melodic contour, is captured by the model. The experimental result
shows that our approach can better capture the characteristics of tori compared
to traditional pitch histograms. Using our approaches, we have examined how
musical discussions proposed in existing academia manifest in the actual field
recordings of Korean folk songs.

<p class="mathjax">In many high-frequency simulation workflows, eigenvalue tracking along a
parameter variation is necessary. This can become computationally prohibitive
when repeated time-consuming eigenvalue problems must be solved. Therefore, we
employ a reduced basis approximation to bring down the computational costs. It
is based on the greedy strategy from Horger et al. 2017 which considers
multiple eigenvalues for elliptic eigenvalue problems. We extend this algorithm
to deal with parameter-dependent domains and the Maxwell eigenvalue problem. In
this setting, the reduced basis may contain spurious eigenmodes, which require
special treatment. We demonstrate our algorithm in an eigenvalue tracking
application for an eigenmode classification.

<p class="mathjax">Speech enhancement is a demanding task in automated speech processing
pipelines, focusing on separating clean speech from noisy channels. Transformer
based models have recently bested RNN and CNN models in speech enhancement,
however at the same time they are much more computationally expensive and
require much more high quality training data, which is always hard to come by.
In this paper, we present an improvement for speech enhancement models that
maintains the expressiveness of self-attention while significantly reducing
model complexity, which we have termed Spectrum Attention Fusion. We carefully
construct a convolutional module to replace several self-attention layers in a
speech Transformer, allowing the model to more efficiently fuse spectral
features. Our proposed model is able to achieve comparable or better results
against SOTA models but with significantly smaller parameters (0.58M) on the
Voice Bank + DEMAND dataset.

<p class="mathjax">To evaluate perception components of an automated driving system, it is
necessary to define the relevant objects. While the urban domain is popular
among perception datasets, relevance is insufficiently specified for this
domain. Therefore, this work adopts an existing method to define relevance in
the highway domain and expands it to the urban domain. While different
conceptualizations and definitions of relevance are present in literature,
there is a lack of methods to validate these definitions. Therefore, this work
presents a novel relevance validation method leveraging a motion prediction
component. The validation leverages the idea that removing irrelevant objects
should not influence a prediction component which reflects human driving
behavior. The influence on the prediction is quantified by considering the
statistical distribution of prediction performance across a large-scale
dataset. The validation procedure is verified using criteria specifically
designed to exclude relevant objects. The validation method is successfully
applied to the relevance criteria from this work, thus supporting their
validity.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present the first study of the computational complexity of
converting an automata-based text index structure, called the Compact Directed
Acyclic Word Graph (CDAWG), of size $e$ for a text $T$ of length $n$ into other
text indexing structures for the same text, suitable for highly repetitive
texts: the run-length BWT of size $r$, the irreducible PLCP array of size $r$,
and the quasi-irreducible LPF array of size $e$, as well as the lex-parse of
size $O(r)$ and the LZ77-parse of size $z$, where $r, z \le e$. As main
results, we showed that the above structures can be optimally computed from
either the CDAWG for $T$ stored in read-only memory or its self-index version
of size $e$ without a text in $O(e)$ worst-case time and words of working
space. To obtain the above results, we devised techniques for enumerating a
particular subset of suffixes in the lexicographic and text orders using the
forward and backward search on the CDAWG by extending the results by
Belazzougui et al. in 2015.

<p class="mathjax">While very popular for evaluating extractive summarization task, the ROUGE
metric has long been criticized for its lack of semantic awareness and its
ignorance about the ranking quality of the summarizer. Thanks to previous
research that has addressed these issues by proposing a gain-based automated
metric called Sem-nCG, which is both rank and semantic aware. However, Sem-nCG
does not consider the amount of redundancy present in a model-generated summary
and currently does not support evaluation with multiple reference summaries.
Unfortunately, addressing both these limitations simultaneously is not trivial.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a redundancy-aware Sem-nCG metric and
demonstrate how this new metric can be used to evaluate model summaries against
multiple references. We also explore different ways of incorporating redundancy
into the original metric through extensive experiments. Experimental results
demonstrate that the new redundancy-aware metric exhibits a higher correlation
with human judgments than the original Sem-nCG metric for both single and
multiple reference scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Research and development of privacy analysis tools currently suffers from a
lack of test beds for evaluation and comparison of such tools. In this work, we
propose a benchmark application that implements an extensive list of privacy
weaknesses based on the LINDDUN methodology. It represents a social network for
patients whose architecture has first been described in an example analysis
conducted by one of the LINDDUN authors. We have implemented this architecture
and extended it with more privacy threats to build a test bed that enables
comprehensive and independent testing of analysis tools.

<p class="mathjax">Scenario-based testing is considered state-of-the-art to verify and validate
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or Automated Driving Systems. Due to the
official launch of the SOTIF-standard (ISO 21448), scenario-based testing
becomes more and more relevant for releasing those Highly Automated Driving
Systems. However, an essential missing detail prevent the practical application
of the SOTIF-standard: How to practically generate scenarios for scenario-based
testing? In this paper, we perform a Systematic Literature Review to identify
techniques that generate scenarios complying with requirements of the
SOTIF-standard. We classify existing scenario generation techniques and
evaluate the characteristics of generated scenarios wrt. SOTIF requirements. We
investigate which details of the real-world are covered by generated scenarios,
whether scenarios are specific for a system under test or generic, and whether
scenarios are designed to minimize the set of unknown and hazardous scenarios.
We conclude that scenarios generated with existing techniques do not comply
with requirements implied by the SOTIF-standard; hence, we propose directions
for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Time series remains one of the most challenging modalities in machine
learning research. The out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and generalization
on time series tend to suffer due to its non-stationary property, i.e., the
distribution changes over time. The dynamic distributions inside time series
pose great challenges to existing algorithms to identify invariant
distributions since they mainly focus on the scenario where the domain
information is given as prior knowledge. In this paper, we attempt to exploit
subdomains within a whole dataset to counteract issues induced by
non-stationary for generalized representation learning. We propose DIVERSIFY, a
general framework, for OOD detection and generalization on dynamic
distributions of time series. DIVERSIFY takes an iterative process: it first
obtains the "worst-case" latent distribution scenario via adversarial training,
then reduces the gap between these latent distributions. We implement DIVERSIFY
via combining existing OOD detection methods according to either extracted
features or outputs of models for detection while we also directly utilize
outputs for classification. In addition, theoretical insights illustrate that
DIVERSIFY is theoretically supported. Extensive experiments are conducted on
seven datasets with different OOD settings across gesture recognition, speech
commands recognition, wearable stress and affect detection, and sensor-based
human activity recognition. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that DIVERSIFY learns more generalized features and significantly outperforms
other baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Depth estimation aims to predict dense depth maps. In autonomous driving
scenes, sparsity of annotations makes the task challenging. Supervised models
produce concave objects due to insufficient structural information. They
overfit to valid pixels and fail to restore spatial structures. Self-supervised
methods are proposed for the problem. Their robustness is limited by pose
estimation, leading to erroneous results in natural scenes. In this paper, we
propose a supervised framework termed Diffusion-Augmented Depth Prediction
(DADP). We leverage the structural characteristics of diffusion model to
enforce depth structures of depth models in a plug-and-play manner. An
object-guided integrality loss is also proposed to further enhance regional
structure integrality by fetching objective information. We evaluate DADP on
three driving benchmarks and achieve significant improvements in depth
structures and robustness. Our work provides a new perspective on depth
estimation with sparse annotations in autonomous driving scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless short-packet communications pose challenges to the security and
reliability of the transmission. Besides, the proactive warder compounds these
challenges, who detects and interferes with the potential transmission. An
extra jamming channel is introduced by the proactive warder compared with the
passive one, resulting in the inapplicability of analytical methods and results
in exsiting works. Thus, effective system design schemes are required for
short-packet communications against the proactive warder. To address this
issue, we consider the analysis and design of covert and reliable transmissions
for above systems. Specifically, to investigate the reliable and covert
performance of the system, detection error probability at the warder and
decoding error probability at the receiver are derived, which is affected by
both the transmit power and the jamming power. Furthermore, to maximize the
effective throughput, an optimization framework is proposed under reliability
and covertness constraints. Numerical results verify the accuracy of analytical
results and the feasibility of the optimization framework. It is shown that the
tradeoff between transmission reliability and covertness is changed by the
proactive warder compared with the passive one. Besides, it is shown that
longer blocklength is always beneficial to improve the throughput for systems
with optimized transmission rates. But when transmission rates are fixed, the
blocklength should be carefully designed since the maximum one is not optimal
in this case.

<p class="mathjax">Partial-information multiple access (PIMA) is an orthogonal multiple access
(OMA) uplink scheme where time is divided into frames, each composed of two
parts. The first part is used to count the number of users with packets to
transmit, while the second has a variable number of allocated slots, each
assigned to multiple users to uplink data transmission. We investigate the case
of correlated user activations, wherein the correlation is due to the
retransmissions of the collided packets, modeling PIMA as a partially
observable-Markov decision process. The assignment of users to slots is
optimized based on the knowledge of both the number of active users and past
successful transmissions and collisions. The scheduling turns out to be a mixed
integer nonlinear programming problem, with a complexity exponentially growing
with the number of users. Thus, sub-optimal greedy solutions are proposed and
evaluated. Our solutions show substantial performance improvements with respect
to both traditional OMA schemes and conventional PIMA.

<p class="mathjax">Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a fundamental machine learning paradigm.
However, its generalization ability is limited in various tasks. In this paper,
we devise Dummy Risk Minimization (DuRM), a frustratingly easy and general
technique to improve the generalization of ERM. DuRM is extremely simple to
implement: just enlarging the dimension of the output logits and then
optimizing using standard gradient descent. Moreover, we validate the efficacy
of DuRM on both theoretical and empirical analysis. Theoretically, we show that
DuRM derives greater variance of the gradient, which facilitates model
generalization by observing better flat local minima. Empirically, we conduct
evaluations of DuRM across different datasets, modalities, and network
architectures on diverse tasks, including conventional classification, semantic
segmentation, out-of-distribution generalization, adverserial training, and
long-tailed recognition. Results demonstrate that DuRM could consistently
improve the performance under all tasks with an almost free lunch manner.
Furthermore, we show that DuRM is compatible with existing generalization
techniques and we discuss possible limitations. We hope that DuRM could trigger
new interest in the fundamental research on risk minimization.

improves over the recycling methods presented in [Burke et al.,

<p class="mathjax">The increasing demand for the web-based digital assistants has given a rapid
rise in the interest of the Information Retrieval (IR) community towards the
field of conversational question answering (ConvQA). However, one of the
critical aspects of ConvQA is the effective selection of conversational history
turns to answer the question at hand. The dependency between relevant history
selection and correct answer prediction is an intriguing but under-explored
area. The selected relevant context can better guide the system so as to where
exactly in the passage to look for an answer. Irrelevant context, on the other
hand, brings noise to the system, thereby resulting in a decline in the model's
performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, DHS-ConvQA (Dynamic History
Selection in Conversational Question Answering), that first generates the
context and question entities for all the history turns, which are then pruned
on the basis of similarity they share in common with the question at hand. We
also propose an attention-based mechanism to re-rank the pruned terms based on
their calculated weights of how useful they are in answering the question. In
the end, we further aid the model by highlighting the terms in the re-ranked
conversational history using a binary classification task and keeping the
useful terms (predicted as 1) and ignoring the irrelevant terms (predicted as
0). We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework with extensive
experimental results on CANARD and QuAC -- the two popularly utilized datasets
in ConvQA. We demonstrate that selecting relevant turns works better than
rewriting the original question. We also investigate how adding the irrelevant
history turns negatively impacts the model's performance and discuss the
research challenges that demand more attention from the IR community.

<p class="mathjax">Short-packet communications are applied to various scenarios where
transmission covertness and reliability are crucial due to the open wireless
medium and finite blocklength. Although intelligent reflection surface (IRS)
has been widely utilized to enhance transmission covertness and reliability,
the question of how many reflection elements at IRS are required remains
unanswered, which is vital to system design and practical deployment. The
inherent strong coupling exists between the transmission covertness and
reliability by IRS, leading to the question of intractability. To address this
issue, the detection error probability at the warder and its approximation are
derived first to reveal the relation between covertness performance and the
number of reflection elements. Besides, to evaluate the reliability performance
of the system, the decoding error probability at the receiver is also derived.
Subsequently, the asymptotic reliability performance in high covertness regimes
is investigated, which provides theoretical predictions about the number of
reflection elements at IRS required to achieve a decoding error probability
close to 0 with given covertness requirements. Furthermore, Monte-Carlo
simulations verify the accuracy of the derived results for detection (decoding)
error probabilities and the validity of the theoretical predictions for
reflection elements. Moreover, results show that more reflection elements are
required to achieve high reliability with tighter covertness requirements,
longer blocklength and higher transmission rates.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the problem of joint subcarrier and power allocation
in the coexistence of radar and multi-user communication systems. Specifically,
in our research scenario, the base station (BS) provides information
transmission services for multiple users while ensuring that its interference
to a separate radar system will not affect the radar's normal function. To this
end, we propose a subcarrier and power allocation scheme based on orthogonal
frequency division multiple access (OFDM). The original problem consisting
involving multivariate fractional programming and binary variables is highly
non-convex. Due to its complexity, we relax the binary constraint by
introducing a penalty term, provided that the optimal solution is not affected.
Then, by integrating multiple power variables into one matrix, the original
problem is reformulated as a multi-ratio fractional programming (FP) problem,
and finally a quadratic transform is employed to make the non-convex problem a
sequence of convex problems. The numerical results indicate the performance
trade-off between the multi-user communication system and the radar system, and
notably that the performance of the communication system is not improved with
power increase in the presence of radar interference beyond a certain
threshold. This provides a useful insight for the energy-efficient design of
the system.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we investigate extending the comprehension of Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to regional objects. To this end, we propose to extract
features corresponding to regional objects as soft prompts for LLM, which
provides a straightforward and scalable approach and eliminates the need for
LLM fine-tuning. To effectively extract regional features from regular image
features and irregular point cloud features, we present a novel and unified
position-assisted feature extraction module. Furthermore, training an MLLM from
scratch is highly time-consuming. Thus, we propose incrementally extending
existing pre-trained MLLMs to comprehend more modalities and the regional
objects of those modalities. Specifically, we freeze the Q-Former from BLIP-2,
an impressive MLLM, and optimize the modality-specific Lora parameters in
Q-Former and LLM for each newly introduced modality. The freezing of the
Q-Former eliminates the need for extensive pre-training on massive image-text
data. The freezed Q-Former pre-trained from massive image-text data is also
beneficial for the pre-training on image-region-text data. We name our
framework RegionBLIP. We pre-train RegionBLIP on image-region-text,
point-cloud-text, and point-cloud-region-text data. Experimental results verify
that \Ours{} can preserve the image comprehension capability of BILP-2 and
further gain a comprehension of the newly introduced point cloud modality and
regional objects. The Data, Code, and Pre-trained models will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Movable antennas (MAs) are a promising paradigm to enhance the spatial
degrees of freedom of conventional multi-antenna systems by flexibly adapting
the positions of the antenna elements within a given transmit area. In this
paper, we model the motion of the MA elements as discrete movements and study
the corresponding resource allocation problem for MA-enabled multiuser
multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication systems. Specifically, we
jointly optimize the beamforming and the MA positions at the base station (BS)
for the minimization of the total transmit power while guaranteeing the minimum
required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each individual
user. To obtain the globally optimal solution to the formulated resource
allocation problem, we develop an iterative algorithm capitalizing on the
generalized Bender's decomposition with guaranteed convergence. Our numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enabled communication system can
significantly reduce the BS transmit power and the number of antenna elements
needed to achieve a desired performance compared to state-of-the-art
techniques, such as antenna selection. Furthermore, we observe that refining
the step size of the MA motion driver improves performance at the expense of a
higher computational complexity.

<p class="mathjax">For more than a century, election officials across the United States have
inspected voting machines before elections using a procedure called Logic and
Accuracy Testing (LAT). This procedure consists of election officials casting a
test deck of ballots into each voting machine and confirming the machine
produces the expected vote total for each candidate. We bring a scientific
perspective to LAT by introducing the first formal approach to designing test
decks with rigorous security guarantees. Specifically, our approach employs
robust optimization to find test decks that are guaranteed to detect any voting
machine misconfiguration that would cause votes to be swapped across
candidates. Out of all the test decks with this security guarantee, our robust
optimization problem yields the test deck with the minimum number of ballots,
thereby minimizing implementation costs for election officials. To facilitate
deployment at scale, we develop a practically efficient exact algorithm for
solving our robust optimization problems based on the cutting plane method. In
partnership with the Michigan Bureau of Elections, we retrospectively applied
our approach to all 6928 ballot styles from Michigan's November 2022 general
election; this retrospective study reveals that the test decks with rigorous
security guarantees obtained by our approach require, on average, only 1.2%
more ballots than current practice. Our approach has since been piloted in
real-world elections by the Michigan Bureau of Elections as a low-cost way to
improve election security and increase public trust in democratic institutions.

Using MASC, we evaluated nine major crypto-detectors, and discovered $19$
unique, undocumented flaws. We designed MASC to be configurable and
user-friendly; a user can configure the parameters to change the nature of
generated mutations. Furthermore, MASC comes with both Command Line Interface

Despite the popularity of ChatGPT, no comprehensive study has been conducted to

incorrect and 77\% are verbose. Nonetheless, ChatGPT answers are still
preferred 39.34\% of the time due to their comprehensiveness and
well-articulated language style. Our result implies the necessity of close

and with mixed-initiative co-creativity, have the potential for great benefits
to human designers. However, co-creative systems for game generation are
typically limited to specific genres, rules, or games, limiting the creativity
of the designer. We seek to model games abstractly enough to apply to any
genre, focusing on designing game systems and mechanics, and create a
controllable, co-creative agent that can collaborate on these designs. We
present a model of games using state-machine-like components and resource
flows, a set of controllable metrics, a design evaluator simulating
playthroughs with these metrics, and an evolutionary design balancer and
generator. We find this system to be both able to express a wide range of games
and able to be human-controllable for future co-creative applications.

<p class="mathjax">This study investigates simpler alternatives to coherent joint transmission
for supporting robust connectivity against signal blockage in mmWave/sub-THz
access networks. By taking an information-theoretic viewpoint, we demonstrate
analytically that with a careful design, full macrodiversity gains and
significant SNR gains can be achieved through canonical receivers and minimal
coordination and synchronization requirements at the infrastructure side. Our
proposed scheme extends non-coherent joint transmission by employing a special
form of diversity to counteract artificially induced deep fades that would
otherwise make this technique often compare unfavorably against standard
transmitter selection schemes. Additionally, the inclusion of an Alamouti-like
space-time coding layer is shown to recover a significant fraction of the
optimal performance. Our conclusions are based on an insightful multi-point
intermittent block fading channel model that enables rigorous ergodic and
outage rate analysis, while also considering timing offsets due to imperfect
delay compensation. Although simplified, our approach captures the essential
features of modern mmWave/sub-THz communications, thereby providing practical

fully automated driving is not yet possible. A human operator ensures safety

capabilities are exceeded. The remote operator thus fulfills the legal
requirements in Germany as a Technical Supervisor to operate highly automated
vehicles at SAE 4. To integrate the remote operator into the automated driving
system, a novel user-centered human-machine interface (HMI) for remote
assistance workplaces was developed and initially evaluated. The insights
gained in this process were incorporated into the design of a workplace
prototype for remote assistance. This prototype was now tested in the study
reported here by 34 participants meeting the professional background criteria
for the role of Technical Supervisor according to the German law by using
typical remote assistance scenarios created in a simulation environment. Even
under elevated cognitive load induced by simultaneously engaging in a secondary
task, participants were able to obtain sufficient situation awareness and
quickly resolve the scenarios. The HMI also yielded favorable usability and
acceptance ratings. The results of the study inform the iterative workplace
development and further research on the remote assistance of highly automated

<p class="mathjax">Many differential equations with physical backgrounds are described as
gradient systems, which are evolution equations driven by the gradient of some
functionals, and such problems have energy conservation or dissipation
properties. For numerical computation of gradient systems, numerical schemes
that inherit the energy structure of the equation play important roles, which
are called structure-preserving. The discrete gradient method is one of the
most classical framework of structure-preserving methods, which is at most
second order accurate. In this paper, we develop a higher-order
structure-preserving numerical method for gradient systems, which includes the
discrete gradient method. We reformulate the gradient system as a coupled
system and then apply the discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping method.
Numerical examples suggests that the order of accuracy of our scheme is $(k+1)$
in general and $(2k+1)$ at nodal times, where $k$ is the degree of polynomials.

<p class="mathjax">Graph classification is a crucial task in many real-world multimedia
applications, where graphs can represent various multimedia data types such as
images, videos, and social networks. Previous efforts have applied graph neural
networks (GNNs) in balanced situations where the class distribution is
balanced. However, real-world data typically exhibit long-tailed class
distributions, resulting in a bias towards the head classes when using GNNs and
limited generalization ability over the tail classes. Recent approaches mainly
focus on re-balancing different classes during model training, which fails to
explicitly introduce new knowledge and sacrifices the performance of the head
classes. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework called
Retrieval Augmented Hybrid Network (RAHNet) to jointly learn a robust feature
extractor and an unbiased classifier in a decoupled manner. In the feature
extractor training stage, we develop a graph retrieval module to search for
relevant graphs that directly enrich the intra-class diversity for the tail
classes. Moreover, we innovatively optimize a category-centered supervised
contrastive loss to obtain discriminative representations, which is more
suitable for long-tailed scenarios. In the classifier fine-tuning stage, we
balance the classifier weights with two weight regularization techniques, i.e.,
Max-norm and weight decay. Experiments on various popular benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) typically model the
relationships among entities utilizing box-level features from pre-defined
detectors. We argue that an overlooked problem in SGG is the coarse-grained
interactions between boxes, which inadequately capture contextual semantics for
relationship modeling, practically limiting the development of the field. In
this paper, we take the initiative to explore and propose a generic paradigm
termed Superpixel-based Interaction Learning (SIL) to remedy coarse-grained
interactions at the box level. It allows us to model fine-grained interactions
at the superpixel level in SGG. Specifically, (i) we treat a scene as a set of
points and cluster them into superpixels representing sub-regions of the scene.
(ii) We explore intra-entity and cross-entity interactions among the
superpixels to enrich fine-grained interactions between entities at an earlier
stage. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks (Visual Genome and
Open Image V6) prove that our SIL enables fine-grained interaction at the
superpixel level above previous box-level methods, and significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. More
encouragingly, the proposed method can be applied to boost the performance of
existing box-level approaches in a plug-and-play fashion. In particular, SIL
brings an average improvement of 2.0% mR (even up to 3.4%) of baselines for the
PredCls task on Visual Genome, which facilitates its integration into any
existing box-level method.

<p class="mathjax">Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) promise next-gen transportation
systems with enhanced safety, energy efficiency, and sustainability. One
typical control strategy for CAVs is the so-called cooperative adaptive cruise
control (CACC) where vehicles drive in platoons and cooperate to achieve safe
and efficient transportation. In this study, we formulate CACC as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. Diverging from existing MARL methods
that use centralized training and decentralized execution which require not
only a centralized communication mechanism but also dense inter-agent
communication, we propose a fully-decentralized MARL framework for enhanced
efficiency and scalability. In addition, a quantization-based communication
scheme is proposed to reduce the communication overhead without significantly
degrading the control performance. This is achieved by employing randomized
rounding numbers to quantize each piece of communicated information and only
communicating non-zero components after quantization. Extensive experimentation
in two distinct CACC settings reveals that the proposed MARL framework
consistently achieves superior performance over several contemporary benchmarks
in terms of both communication efficiency and control efficacy.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Network (DNN) has achieved great success on datasets of closed
class set. However, new classes, like new categories of social media topics,
are continuously added to the real world, making it necessary to incrementally
learn. This is hard for DNN because it tends to focus on fitting to new classes
while ignoring old classes, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting.
State-of-the-art methods rely on knowledge distillation and data replay
techniques but still have limitations. In this work, we analyze the causes of
catastrophic forgetting in class incremental learning, which owes to three
factors: representation drift, representation confusion, and classifier
distortion. Based on this view, we propose a two-stage learning framework with
a fixed encoder and an incrementally updated prototype classifier. The encoder
is trained with self-supervised learning to generate a feature space with high
intrinsic dimensionality, thus improving its transferability and generality.
The classifier incrementally learns new prototypes while retaining the
prototypes of previously learned data, which is crucial in preserving the
decision boundary.Our method does not rely on preserved samples of old classes,
is thus a non-exemplar based CIL method. Experiments on public datasets show
that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art exemplar-based
methods when they reserved 5 examplers per class, under the incremental setting
of 10 phases, by 18.24% on CIFAR-100 and 9.37% on ImageNet100.

<p class="mathjax">Graph neural networks have been shown to be very effective in utilizing
pairwise relationships across samples. Recently, there have been several
successful proposals to generalize graph neural networks to hypergraph neural
networks to exploit more complex relationships. In particular, the hypergraph
collaborative networks yield superior results compared to other hypergraph
neural networks for various semi-supervised learning tasks. The collaborative
network can provide high quality vertex embeddings and hyperedge embeddings
together by formulating them as a joint optimization problem and by using their
consistency in reconstructing the given hypergraph. In this paper, we aim to
establish the algorithmic stability of the core layer of the collaborative
network and provide generalization guarantees. The analysis sheds light on the
design of hypergraph filters in collaborative networks, for instance, how the
data and hypergraph filters should be scaled to achieve uniform stability of
the learning process. Some experimental results on real-world datasets are
presented to illustrate the theory.

<p class="mathjax">Quantization has emerged as an essential technique for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) on devices with limited resources. However, quantized models
exhibit vulnerabilities when exposed to various noises in real-world
applications. Despite the importance of evaluating the impact of quantization
on robustness, existing research on this topic is limited and often disregards
established principles of robustness evaluation, resulting in incomplete and
inconclusive findings. To address this gap, we thoroughly evaluated the
robustness of quantized models against various noises (adversarial attacks,
natural corruptions, and systematic noises) on ImageNet. The comprehensive
evaluation results empirically provide valuable insights into the robustness of
quantized models in various scenarios, for example: (1) quantized models
exhibit higher adversarial robustness than their floating-point counterparts,
but are more vulnerable to natural corruptions and systematic noises; (2) in
general, increasing the quantization bit-width results in a decrease in
adversarial robustness, an increase in natural robustness, and an increase in
systematic robustness; (3) among corruption methods, \textit{impulse noise} and
\textit{glass blur} are the most harmful to quantized models, while
\textit{brightness} has the least impact; (4) among systematic noises, the
\textit{nearest neighbor interpolation} has the highest impact, while bilinear
interpolation, cubic interpolation, and area interpolation are the three least
harmful. Our research contributes to advancing the robust quantization of
models and their deployment in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel semi-supervised Graph Counterfactual Explainer (GCE)
methodology, Dynamic GRAph Counterfactual Explainer (DyGRACE). It leverages
initial knowledge about the data distribution to search for valid
counterfactuals while avoiding using information from potentially outdated
decision functions in subsequent time steps. Employing two graph autoencoders
(GAEs), DyGRACE learns the representation of each class in a binary
classification scenario. The GAEs minimise the reconstruction error between the
original graph and its learned representation during training. The method
involves (i) optimising a parametric density function (implemented as a
logistic regression function) to identify counterfactuals by maximising the
factual autoencoder's reconstruction error, (ii) minimising the counterfactual
autoencoder's error, and (iii) maximising the similarity between the factual
and counterfactual graphs. This semi-supervised approach is independent of an
underlying black-box oracle. A logistic regression model is trained on a set of
graph pairs to learn weights that aid in finding counterfactuals. At inference,
for each unseen graph, the logistic regressor identifies the best
counterfactual candidate using these learned weights, while the GAEs can be
iteratively updated to represent the continual adaptation of the learned graph
representation over iterations. DyGRACE is quite effective and can act as a
drift detector, identifying distributional drift based on differences in
reconstruction errors between iterations. It avoids reliance on the oracle's
predictions in successive iterations, thereby increasing the efficiency of
counterfactual discovery. DyGRACE, with its capacity for contrastive learning
and drift detection, will offer new avenues for semi-supervised learning and
explanation generation.

<p class="mathjax">Remote sensing image change detection aims to identify the differences
between images acquired at different times in the same area. It is widely used
in land management, environmental monitoring, disaster assessment and other
fields. Currently, most change detection methods are based on Siamese network
structure or early fusion structure. Siamese structure focuses on extracting
object features at different times but lacks attention to change information,
which leads to false alarms and missed detections. Early fusion (EF) structure
focuses on extracting features after the fusion of images of different phases
but ignores the significance of object features at different times for
detecting change details, making it difficult to accurately discern the edges
of changed objects. To address these issues and obtain more accurate results,
we propose a novel network, Triplet UNet(T-UNet), based on a three-branch
encoder, which is capable to simultaneously extract the object features and the
change features between the pre- and post-time-phase images through triplet
encoder. To effectively interact and fuse the features extracted from the three
branches of triplet encoder, we propose a multi-branch spatial-spectral
cross-attention module (MBSSCA). In the decoder stage, we introduce the channel
attention mechanism (CAM) and spatial attention mechanism (SAM) to fully mine
and integrate detailed textures information at the shallow layer and semantic
localization information at the deep layer.

<p class="mathjax">The recent advances in large language models (LLM) and foundation models with
emergent capabilities have been shown to improve the performance of many NLP
tasks. LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KG) can complement each other such that LLMs
can be used for KG construction or completion while existing KGs can be used
for different tasks such as making LLM outputs explainable or fact-checking in
Neuro-Symbolic manner. In this paper, we present Text2KGBench, a benchmark to
evaluate the capabilities of language models to generate KGs from natural
language text guided by an ontology. Given an input ontology and a set of
sentences, the task is to extract facts from the text while complying with the
given ontology (concepts, relations, domain/range constraints) and being
faithful to the input sentences. We provide two datasets (i) Wikidata-TekGen
with 10 ontologies and 13,474 sentences and (ii) DBpedia-WebNLG with 19
ontologies and 4,860 sentences. We define seven evaluation metrics to measure
fact extraction performance, ontology conformance, and hallucinations by LLMs.
Furthermore, we provide results for two baseline models, Vicuna-13B and
Alpaca-LoRA-13B using automatic prompt generation from test cases. The baseline
results show that there is room for improvement using both Semantic Web and
Natural Language Processing techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale cloud data centers have gained popularity due to their high
availability, rapid elasticity, scalability, and low cost. However, current
data centers continue to have high failure rates due to the lack of proper
resource utilization and early failure detection. To maximize resource
efficiency and reduce failure rates in large-scale cloud data centers, it is
crucial to understand the workload and failure characteristics. In this paper,
we perform a deep analysis of the 2019 Google Cluster Trace Dataset, which
contains 2.4TiB of workload traces from eight different clusters around the
world. We explore the characteristics of failed and killed jobs in Google's
production cloud and attempt to correlate them with key attributes such as
resource usage, job priority, scheduling class, job duration, and the number of
task resubmissions. Our analysis reveals several important characteristics of
failed jobs that contribute to job failure and hence, could be used for
developing an early failure prediction system. Also, we present a novel usage
analysis to identify heterogeneity in jobs and tasks submitted by users. We are
able to identify specific users who control more than half of all collection
events on a single cluster. We contend that these characteristics could be
useful in developing an early job failure prediction system that could be
utilized for dynamic rescheduling of the job scheduler and thus improving
resource utilization in large-scale cloud data centers while reducing failure
rates.

<p class="mathjax">In the marked temporal point processes (MTPP), a core problem is to
parameterize the conditional joint PDF (probability distribution function)
$p^*(m,t)$ for inter-event time $t$ and mark $m$, conditioned on the history.
The majority of existing studies predefine intensity functions. Their utility
is challenged by specifying the intensity function's proper form, which is
critical to balance expressiveness and processing efficiency. Recently, there
are studies moving away from predefining the intensity function -- one models
$p^*(t)$ and $p^*(m)$ separately, while the other focuses on temporal point
processes (TPPs), which do not consider marks. This study aims to develop
high-fidelity $p^*(m,t)$ for discrete events where the event marks are either
categorical or numeric in a multi-dimensional continuous space. We propose a
solution framework IFIB (\underline{I}ntensity-\underline{f}ree
\underline{I}ntegral-\underline{b}ased process) that models conditional joint
PDF $p^*(m,t)$ directly without intensity functions. It remarkably simplifies
the process to compel the essential mathematical restrictions. We show the
desired properties of IFIB and the superior experimental results of IFIB on
real-world and synthetic datasets. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of vertical federated learning (VFL) has stimulated concerns
about the imperfection in privacy protection, as shared feature embeddings may
reveal sensitive information under privacy attacks. This paper studies the
delicate equilibrium between data privacy and task utility goals of VFL under
differential privacy (DP). To address the generality issue of prior arts, this
paper advocates a flexible and generic approach that decouples the two goals
and addresses them successively. Specifically, we initially derive a rigorous
privacy guarantee by applying norm clipping on shared feature embeddings, which
is applicable across various datasets and models. Subsequently, we demonstrate
that task utility can be optimized via adaptive adjustments on the scale and
distribution of feature embeddings in an accuracy-appreciative way, without
compromising established DP mechanisms. We concretize our observation into the
proposed VFL-AFE framework, which exhibits effectiveness against privacy
attacks and the capacity to retain favorable task utility, as substantiated by
extensive experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Optical Character Recognition (OCR) enables automatic text extraction from
scanned or digitized text images, but it also makes it easy to pirate valuable
or sensitive text from these images. Previous methods to prevent OCR piracy by
distorting characters in text images are impractical in real-world scenarios,
as pirates can capture arbitrary portions of the text images, rendering the
defenses ineffective. In this work, we propose a novel and effective defense
mechanism termed the Universal Defensive Underpainting Patch (UDUP) that
modifies the underpainting of text images instead of the characters. UDUP is
created through an iterative optimization process to craft a small, fixed-size
defensive patch that can generate non-overlapping underpainting for text images
of any size. Experimental results show that UDUP effectively defends against
unauthorized OCR under the setting of any screenshot range or complex image
background. It is agnostic to the content, size, colors, and languages of
characters, and is robust to typical image operations such as scaling and
compressing. In addition, the transferability of UDUP is demonstrated by
evading several off-the-shelf OCRs. The code is available at
https://github.com/QRICKDD/UDUP.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic signals play an important role in transportation by enabling traffic
flow management, and ensuring safety at intersections. In addition, knowing the
traffic signal phase and timing data can allow optimal vehicle routing for time
and energy efficiency, eco-driving, and the accurate simulation of signalized
road networks. In this paper, we present a machine learning (ML) method for
estimating traffic signal timing information from vehicle probe data. To the
authors best knowledge, very few works have presented ML techniques for
determining traffic signal timing parameters from vehicle probe data. In this
work, we develop an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to estimate
signal cycle lengths and a neural network model to determine the corresponding
red times per phase from probe data. The green times are then be derived from
the cycle length and red times. Our results show an error of less than 0.56 sec
for cycle length, and red times predictions within 7.2 sec error on average.

<p class="mathjax">The offshore oil and natural gas platforms, mostly powered by diesel or gas
generators, consume approximately 16TWh of electricity worldwide per year,
which emits large amount of CO2. To limit their contribution to climate change,
a proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy
resources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing
such a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and
reducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies
including microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy
converters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery
energy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for
sizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization
renewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the
generation and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the
variability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,
as well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage
system. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource
sizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while
maintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.

consumers in Brazil and the US before, during, and after a major election to
understand the consumption and production of election and medical
misinformation. This study contributes to research on misinformation ecosystems
by focusing on poorly understood small players, or "micro-influencers", who
create misinformation in peer-to-peer networks. We detail four key tactics that
micro-influencers use. First, they typically disseminate misleading "gray area"
content rather than falsifiable claims, using subtle aesthetic and rhetorical
tactics to evade moderation. Second, they post in small, closed groups where
members feel safe and predisposed to trust content. Third, they explicitly
target misinformation consumers' emotional and social needs. Finally, they post
a high volume of short, repetitive content to plant seeds of doubt and build
trust in influencers as unofficial experts. We discuss the implications these
micro-influencers have for misinformation interventions and platforms' efforts
to moderate misinformation.

<p class="mathjax">Survival analysis is a fundamental tool in medicine, modeling the time until
an event of interest occurs in a population. However, in real-world
applications, survival data are often incomplete, censored, distributed, and
confidential, especially in healthcare settings where privacy is critical. The
scarcity of data can severely limit the scalability of survival models to
distributed applications that rely on large data pools. Federated learning is a
promising technique that enables machine learning models to be trained on
multiple datasets without compromising user privacy, making it particularly
well-suited for addressing the challenges of survival data and large-scale
survival applications. Despite significant developments in federated learning
for classification and regression, many directions remain unexplored in the
context of survival analysis. In this work, we propose an extension of the
Federated Survival Forest algorithm, called FedSurF++. This federated ensemble
method constructs random survival forests in heterogeneous federations.
Specifically, we investigate several new tree sampling methods from client
forests and compare the results with state-of-the-art survival models based on
neural networks. The key advantage of FedSurF++ is its ability to achieve
comparable performance to existing methods while requiring only a single
communication round to complete. The extensive empirical investigation results
in a significant improvement from the algorithmic and privacy preservation
perspectives, making the original FedSurF algorithm more efficient, robust, and
private. We also present results on two real-world datasets demonstrating the
success of FedSurF++ in real-world healthcare studies. Our results underscore
the potential of FedSurF++ to improve the scalability and effectiveness of
survival analysis in distributed settings while preserving user privacy.

<p class="mathjax">The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on the
original disruption indicator (DI1) and its variants in scientometrics. The DI1
has received much media attention and prompted a public debate about science
policy implications, since a study published in Nature found that papers in all
disciplines and patents are becoming less disruptive over time. This review
explains in the first part the DI1 and its variants in detail by examining
their technical and theoretical properties. The remaining parts of the review
are devoted to studies that examine the validity and the limitations of the
indicators. Particular focus is placed on (1) the time-sensitivity of
disruption scores, (2) the convergent validity of disruption scores with expert
judgments, and (3) the comparative performance of the DI1 and its variants. The
review shows that, while the literature on convergent validity is not entirely
conclusive, it is clear that some modified indicator variants, in particular
DI5, show higher degrees of convergent validity than DI1. Limitations of the
DI1 and its variants are summarized, and best practice guidelines are provided.
The review encourages users of the indicator to inform about the variety of DI1
variants and to apply the most appropriate variant. More research on the
convergent validity of the DI1 and its variants as well as on the
time-sensitivity of disruption scores is needed before the indicators can be
used in the research evaluation practice.

hyperbolic partial differential equations sourced by distributions (Dirac
$\delta$-functions and their derivatives). Such problems arise when studying
binary black hole systems in the extreme mass ratio limit. We demonstrate that
such source terms may be converted to effective domain-wide sources when
discretized, and we introduce a class of time-steppers that directly account
for these discontinuities in time integration. Moreover, our time-steppers are
constructed to respect time reversal symmetry, a property that has been
connected to conservation of physical quantities like energy and momentum in
numerical simulations. To illustrate the utility of our method, we numerically
study a distributionally-sourced wave equation that shares many features with
the equations governing linear perturbations to black holes sourced by a point

Specifically, only the arrival and departure times from the network are

infinite horizon.
<br />While reinforcement learning in Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes (POMDP) is prohibitively expensive in general, we show that our
algorithm has a regret that only depends sub-linearly on the maximal number of
jobs in the network, $S$. In particular, in contrast with existing regret
analyses, our regret bound does not depend on the diameter of the underlying
Markov Decision Process (MDP), which in most queueing systems is at least
exponential in $S$.
<br />The novelty of our approach is to leverage Norton's equivalent theorem for

<p class="mathjax">Diffeomorphic registration has become a powerful approach for seeking a
smooth and invertible spatial transformation between two coordinate systems
which have been measured via the template and reference images. While the
pointwise volume-preserving constraint is effective for some problems, it is
too stringent for many other problems especially when the local deformations
are relatively large, because it may lead to a poor large-deformation for
enforcing local matching.In this paper, we propose a novel bi-variant
diffeomorphic image registration model with the soft constraint of Jacobian
equation, which allows local deformations to shrink and grow in a flexible
range.The Jacobian determinant of the transformation is explicitly controlled
by optimizing the relaxation function. To prevent deformation folding and
enhance the smoothness of deformation, we not only impose a positivity
constraint in optimizing the relaxation function, but also employ a regularizer
to ensure the smoothness of the relaxation function.Furthermore, the positivity
constraint ensures that is as close to one as possible, which helps to obtain a
volume-preserving transformation on average.We further analyze the existence of
the minimizer for the variational model and propose a penalty splitting method
with a multilevel strategy to solve this model. Numerical experiments show that
the proposed algorithm is convergent, and the positivity constraint can control
the range of relative volume and not compromise registration accuracy.
Moreover, the proposed model produces diffeomorphic maps for large deformation,
and achieves better performance compared to the several existing registration
models.

<p class="mathjax">Unrolling a decoding algorithm allows to achieve extremely high throughput at
the cost of increased area. Look-up tables (LUTs) can be used to replace
functions otherwise implemented as circuits. In this work, we show the impact
of replacing blocks of logic by carefully crafted LUTs in unrolled decoders for
polar codes. We show that using LUTs to improve key performance metrics (e.g.,
area, throughput, latency) may turn out more challenging than expected. We
present three variants of LUT-based decoders and describe their inner workings
as well as circuits in detail. The LUT-based decoders are compared against a
regular unrolled decoder, employing fixed-point representations for numbers,
with a comparable error-correction performance. A short systematic polar code
is used as an illustration. All resulting unrolled decoders are shown to be
capable of an information throughput of little under 10 Gbps in a 28 nm FD-SOI
technology clocked in the vicinity of 1.4 GHz to 1.5 GHz. The best variant of
our LUT-based decoders is shown to reduce the area requirements by 23% compared
to the regular unrolled decoder while retaining a comparable error-correction
performance.

<p class="mathjax">To harness the true potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
sustainability and societal betterment, we need to move away from the goals of
racing to mimic human behaviour and prioritising corporate interests, where
workers are continuously exploited. The unpaid labour and societal harms which
are generated from Digital Value Networks (DVNs) used by companies producing AI
needs to be regulated. Unethical data collection and data labelling practices
have serious consequences, as evidenced by the case studies reviewed in this
short paper, such as with influencer marketing. This paper addresses important
neglected areas of study in worker and user data and labeling exploitation
practices, where ethical AI could be impactful.

<p class="mathjax">Emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) represent a disruptive technology that
allows a paradigm shift from the conventional von Neumann architecture towards
more efficient computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures. Several instrumentation
platforms have been proposed to interface NVMs allowing the characterization of
single cells and crossbar structures. However, these platforms suffer from low
flexibility and are not capable of performing CIM operations on NVMs.
Therefore, we recently designed and built the NeuroBreakoutBoard, a highly
versatile instrumentation platform capable of executing CIM on NVMs. We present
our preliminary results demonstrating a relative error &lt; 5% in the range of 1
k$\Omega$ to 1 M$\Omega$ and showcase the switching behavior of a
HfO$_2$/Ti-based memristive cell.

<p class="mathjax">Non-fungible tokens(NFTs) are on the rise. They can represent artworks
exhibited for marketing purposes on webpages of companies or online stores --
analogously to physical artworks. Lending of NFTs is an attractive form of
passive income for owners but comes with risks (e.g., items are not returned)
and costs for escrow agents. Similarly, renters have difficulties in
anticipating the impact of artworks, e.g., how spectators of NFTs perceive
them. To address these challenges, we introduce an NFT rental solution based on
a pay-per-like pricing model using blockchain technology, i.e., smart contracts
based on the Ethereum chain. We find that blockchain solutions enjoy many
advantages also reported for other applications, but interestingly, we also
observe dark sides of (large) blockchain fees. Blockchain solutions appear
unfair to niche artists and potentially hamper cultural diversity. Furthermore,
a trust-cost tradeoff arises to handle fraud caused by manipulation from
parties outside the blockchain. All code for the solution is publicly available
at: https://github.com/asopi/rental-project

terms of biological plausibility, computational cost, and suitability for

alternative biologically plausible learning approaches that rely on local

matching (SM) framework, which aligns with observed mechanisms in biological
systems and offers online, localized, and biologically plausible algorithms. i)
To scale SM to large datasets, we propose an implementation of Convolutional
Nonnegative SM using PyTorch. ii) We introduce a localized supervised SM
objective reminiscent of canonical correlation analysis, facilitating stacking
SM layers. iii) We leverage the PyTorch implementation for pre-training
architectures such as LeNet and compare the evaluation of features against
BP-trained models. This work combines biologically plausible algorithms with
computational efficiency opening multiple avenues for further explorations.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models such as ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 are ubiquitous and
dominate the current discourse. Their transformative capabilities have led to a
paradigm shift in how we interact with and utilize (text-based) information.
Each day, new possibilities to leverage the capabilities of these models
emerge. This paper presents findings on the performance of different large
language models in a university of applied sciences' undergraduate computer
science degree program. Our primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of
these models within the curriculum by employing them as educational aids. By
prompting the models with lecture material, exercise tasks, and past exams, we
aim to evaluate their proficiency across different computer science domains. We
showcase the strong performance of current large language models while
highlighting limitations and constraints within the context of such a degree
program. We found that ChatGPT-3.5 averaged 79.9% of the total score in 10
tested modules, BingAI achieved 68.4%, and LLaMa, in the 65 billion parameter
variant, 20%. Despite these convincing results, even GPT-4.0 would not pass the
degree program - due to limitations in mathematical calculations.

algorithm that integrates the Zermelo's Navigation Initial Value Problem with
the Ferraro-Mart\'in de Diego-Almagro algorithm to find the optimal route for a
vessel to reach its destination. Our algorithm is designed to work in both
Euclidean and spherical spaces and utilizes a heuristic that allows the vessel
to move forward while remaining within a predetermined search cone centred
around the destination. This approach not only improves efficiency but also
includes obstacle avoidance, making it well-suited for real-world applications.
We evaluate the performance of the Hybrid Search algorithm on synthetic vector

and care towards a principal that employs them. When fiduciary organizations
interact with users through a digital interface, or otherwise automate their
operations with artificial intelligence, they will need to design these AI
systems to be compliant with their duties. This article synthesizes recent work
in computer science and law to develop a procedure for designing and auditing
Fiduciary AI. The designer of a Fiduciary AI should understand the context of
the system, identify its principals, and assess the best interests of those
principals. Then the designer must be loyal with respect to those interests,
and careful in an contextually appropriate way. We connect the steps in this
procedure to dimensions of Trustworthy AI, such as privacy and alignment.
Fiduciary AI is a promising means to address the incompleteness of data

student understanding and encouraging critical exploration of course material.
Providing feedback for such responses is a time-consuming task that can lead to
overwhelmed instructors and decreased feedback quality. Many instructors resort
to simpler question formats, like multiple-choice questions, which provide
immediate feedback but at the expense of personalized and insightful comments.
Here, we present a tool that uses large language models (LLMs), guided by
instructor-defined criteria, to automate responses to open-ended questions. Our
tool delivers rapid personalized feedback, enabling students to quickly test
their knowledge and identify areas for improvement. We provide open-source
reference implementations both as a web application and as a Jupyter Notebook

limitations of AI, and (2) the pedagogical educational objectives. Based on
insights from the Delors report on education [1], we first address the role of
education and recall the main objectives that educational institutes must
strive to achieve independently of any technology. We then explore the
strengths and limitations of AI, based on current advances in AI. We explain
how courses and exams can be designed based on these strengths and limitations
of AI, providing different examples in the IT, English, and Art domains. We
show how we adopted a pedagogical approach that is inspired from the Socratic
teaching method from January 2023 to May 2023. Then, we present the data
analysis results of seven ChatGPT-authorized exams conducted between December
2022 and March 2023. Our exam data results show that there is no correlation
between students' grades and whether or not they use ChatGPT to answer their
exam questions. Finally, we present a new exam system that allows us to apply
our pedagogical approach in the AI era.

<p class="mathjax">Graph-based kNN algorithms have garnered widespread popularity for machine
learning tasks, due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, the
conventional kNN graph's reliance on a fixed value of k can hinder its
performance, especially in scenarios involving complex data distributions.
Moreover, like other classification models, the presence of ambiguous samples
along decision boundaries often presents a challenge, as they are more prone to
incorrect classification. To address these issues, we propose the Preferential
Attached k-Nearest Neighbors Graph (paNNG), which combines adaptive kNN with
distribution-based graph construction. By incorporating distribution
information, paNNG can significantly improve performance for ambiguous samples
by "pulling" them towards their original classes and hence enable enhanced
overall accuracy and generalization capability. Through rigorous evaluations on
diverse benchmark datasets, paNNG outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms,
showcasing its adaptability and efficacy across various real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense officially disclosed a set of ethical
principles to guide the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies on
future battlefields. Despite stark differences, there are core similarities
between the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face
life-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical
providers experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare
environment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a
life-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to
efficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing
power becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as
electronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases,
it is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology.
Recently, generative AI has captivated the research community, leading to
debates about its application in healthcare, mainly due to concerns about
transparency and related issues. Meanwhile, concerns about the potential
exacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable
ethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However,
the ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied,
and decision-makers often fail to consider the significance of generative AI.
In this paper, we propose GREAT PLEA ethical principles, encompassing
governance, reliability, equity, accountability, traceability, privacy,
lawfulness, empathy, and autonomy, for generative AI in healthcare. We aim to
proactively address the ethical dilemmas and challenges posed by the
integration of generative AI in healthcare.

<p class="mathjax">Biomimetic, dexterous robotic hands have the potential to replicate much of
the tasks that a human can do, and to achieve status as a general manipulation
platform. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have
achieved remarkable performance in quadrupedal locomotion and dexterous
manipulation tasks. Combined with GPU-based highly parallelized simulations
capable of simulating thousands of robots in parallel, RL-based controllers
have become more scalable and approachable. However, in order to bring
RL-trained policies to the real world, we require training frameworks that
output policies that can work with physical actuators and sensors as well as a
hardware platform that can be manufactured with accessible materials yet is
robust enough to run interactive policies. This work introduces the biomimetic
tendon-driven Faive Hand and its system architecture, which uses tendon-driven
rolling contact joints to achieve a 3D printable, robust high-DoF hand design.
We model each element of the hand and integrate it into a GPU simulation
environment to train a policy with RL, and achieve zero-shot transfer of a
dexterous in-hand sphere rotation skill to the physical robot hand.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML) has shown significant potential in various
applications; however, its adoption in privacy-critical domains has been
limited due to concerns about data privacy. A promising solution to this issue
is Federated Machine Learning (FedML), a model-to-data approach that
prioritizes data privacy. By enabling ML algorithms to be applied directly to
distributed data sources without sharing raw data, FedML offers enhanced
privacy protections, making it suitable for privacy-critical environments.
Despite its theoretical benefits, FedML has not seen widespread practical
implementation. This study aims to explore the current state of applied FedML
and identify the challenges hindering its practical adoption. Through a
comprehensive systematic literature review, we assess 74 relevant papers to
analyze the real-world applicability of FedML. Our analysis focuses on the
characteristics and emerging trends of FedML implementations, as well as the
motivational drivers and application domains. We also discuss the encountered
challenges in integrating FedML into real-life settings. By shedding light on
the existing landscape and potential obstacles, this research contributes to
the further development and implementation of FedML in privacy-critical
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal characteristics are prominently evident in a substantial volume of
knowledge, which underscores the pivotal role of Temporal Knowledge Graphs
(TKGs) in both academia and industry. However, TKGs often suffer from
incompleteness for three main reasons: the continuous emergence of new
knowledge, the weakness of the algorithm for extracting structured information
from unstructured data, and the lack of information in the source dataset.
Thus, the task of Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) has attracted
increasing attention, aiming to predict missing items based on the available
information. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGC methods
and their details. Specifically, this paper mainly consists of three
components, namely, 1)Background, which covers the preliminaries of TKGC
methods, loss functions required for training, as well as the dataset and
evaluation protocol; 2)Interpolation, that estimates and predicts the missing
elements or set of elements through the relevant available information. It
further categorizes related TKGC methods based on how to process temporal
information; 3)Extrapolation, which typically focuses on continuous TKGs and
predicts future events, and then classifies all extrapolation methods based on
the algorithms they utilize. We further pinpoint the challenges and discuss
future research directions of TKGC.

<p class="mathjax">Developing robot controllers capable of achieving dexterous nonprehensile
manipulation, such as pushing an object on a table, is challenging. The
underactuated and hybrid-dynamics nature of the problem, further complicated by
the uncertainty resulting from the frictional interactions, requires
sophisticated control behaviors. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful
framework for developing such robot controllers. However, previous RL
literature addressing the nonprehensile pushing task achieves low accuracy,
non-smooth trajectories, and only simple motions, i.e. without rotation of the
manipulated object. We conjecture that previously used unimodal exploration
strategies fail to capture the inherent hybrid-dynamics of the task, arising
from the different possible contact interaction modes between the robot and the
object, such as sticking, sliding, and separation. In this work, we propose a
multimodal exploration approach through categorical distributions, which
enables us to train planar pushing RL policies for arbitrary starting and
target object poses, i.e. positions and orientations, and with improved
accuracy. We show that the learned policies are robust to external disturbances
and observation noise, and scale to tasks with multiple pushers. Furthermore,
we validate the transferability of the learned policies, trained entirely in
simulation, to a physical robot hardware using the KUKA iiwa robot arm. See our
supplemental video: https://youtu.be/vTdva1mgrk4.

<p class="mathjax">One predominant challenge in additive manufacturing (AM) is to achieve
specific material properties by manipulating manufacturing process parameters
during the runtime. Such manipulation tends to increase the computational load
imposed on existing simulation tools employed in AM. The goal of the present
work is to construct a fast and accurate reduced-order model (ROM) for an AM
model developed within the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(MOOSE) framework, ultimately reducing the time/cost of AM control and
optimization processes. Our adoption of the operator learning (OL) approach
enabled us to learn a family of differential equations produced by altering
process variables in the laser's Gaussian point heat source. More specifically,
we used the Fourier neural operator (FNO) and deep operator network (DeepONet)
to develop ROMs for time-dependent responses. Furthermore, we benchmarked the
performance of these OL methods against a conventional deep neural network
(DNN)-based ROM. Ultimately, we found that OL methods offer comparable
performance and, in terms of accuracy and generalizability, even outperform DNN
at predicting scalar model responses. The DNN-based ROM afforded the fastest
training time. Furthermore, all the ROMs were faster than the original MOOSE
model yet still provided accurate predictions. FNO had a smaller mean
prediction error than DeepONet, with a larger variance for time-dependent
responses. Unlike DNN, both FNO and DeepONet were able to simulate time series
data without the need for dimensionality reduction techniques. The present work
can help facilitate the AM optimization process by enabling faster execution of
simulation tools while still preserving evaluation accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we aim to initiate the development of Radiology Foundation
Model, termed as RadFM.We consider the construction of foundational models from
the perspectives of data, model design, and evaluation thoroughly. Our
contribution can be concluded as follows: (i), we construct a large-scale
Medical Multi-modal Dataset, MedMD, consisting of 16M 2D and 3D medical scans.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal dataset containing
3D medical scans. (ii), We propose an architecture that enables visually
conditioned generative pre-training, allowing for the integration of text input
interleaved with 2D or 3D medical scans to generate response for diverse
radiologic tasks. The model was initially pre-trained on MedMD and subsequently
domain-specific fine-tuned on RadMD, a radiologic cleaned version of MedMD,
containing 3M radiologic visual-language pairs. (iii), we propose a new
evaluation benchmark that comprises five tasks, aiming to comprehensively
assess the capability of foundation models in handling practical clinical
problems. Our experimental results confirm that RadFM significantly outperforms
existing multi-modal foundation models. The codes, data, and model checkpoint
will all be made publicly available to promote further research and development
in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
by keeping the raw data of the involved workers private. One of its main
objectives is to improve the models' privacy, security, and scalability.
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers an efficient cross-silo setting where
a few parties collaboratively train a model without sharing the same features.
In such a scenario, classification labels are commonly considered sensitive
information held exclusively by one (active) party, while other (passive)
parties use only their local information. Recent works have uncovered important
flaws of VFL, leading to possible label inference attacks under the assumption
that the attacker has some, even limited, background knowledge on the relation
between labels and data. In this work, we are the first (to the best of our
knowledge) to investigate label inference attacks on VFL using a
zero-background knowledge strategy. To concretely formulate our proposal, we
focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a target model for the underlying VFL.
In particular, we refer to node classification tasks, which are widely studied,
and GNNs have shown promising results. Our proposed attack, BlindSage, provides
impressive results in the experiments, achieving nearly 100% accuracy in most
cases. Even when the attacker has no information about the used architecture or
the number of classes, the accuracy remained above 85% in most instances.
Finally, we observe that well-known defenses cannot mitigate our attack without
affecting the model's performance on the main classification task.

</div>
<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a systematic approach for accelerating finite
element-type methods by machine learning for the numerical solution of partial
differential equations (PDEs). The main idea is to use a neural network to
learn the solution map of the PDEs and to do so in an element-wise fashion.
This map takes input of the element geometry and the PDEs' parameters on that
element, and gives output of two operators -- (1) the in2out operator for
inter-element communication, and (2) the in2sol operator (Green's function) for
element-wise solution recovery. A significant advantage of this approach is
that, once trained, this network can be used for the numerical solution of the
PDE for any domain geometry and any parameter distribution without retraining.
Also, the training is significantly simpler since it is done on the element
level instead on the entire domain. We call this approach element learning.
This method is closely related to hybridizbale discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
methods in the sense that the local solvers of HDG are replaced by machine
learning approaches. Numerical tests are presented for an example PDE, the
radiative transfer equation, in a variety of scenarios with idealized or
realistic cloud fields, with smooth or sharp gradient in the cloud boundary
transition. Under a fixed accuracy level of $10^{-3}$ in the relative $L^2$
error, and polynomial degree $p=6$ in each element, we observe an approximately
5 to 10 times speed-up by element learning compared to a classical finite
element-type method.

tournament contains at least one vertex v such that every other vertex is
reachable from v by a path of length at most 2. All such vertices v are called
*kings* of the underlying tournament. Despite active recent research in the
area, the best-known upper and lower bounds on the deterministic query
complexity (with query access to directions of edges) of finding a king in a
tournament on n vertices are from over 20 years ago, and the bounds do not
match: the best-known lower bound is Omega(n^{4/3}) and the best-known upper
bound is O(n^{3/2}) [Shen, Sheng, Wu, SICOMP'03]. Our contribution is to show
essentially *tight* bounds (up to logarithmic factors) of Theta(n) and
Theta(sqrt{n}) in the *randomized* and *quantum* query models, respectively. We

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we outline the development of a scalable PBF thermal history
simulation built on CAPL and based on melt pool physics and dynamics. The new
approach inherits linear scalability from CAPL and has three novel ingredients.
Firstly, to simulate the laser scanning on a solid surface, we discretize the
entire simulation domain instead of only the manufacturing toolpath by
appending fictitious paths to the manufacturing toolpath. Secondly, to simulate
the scanning on overlapping toolpaths, the path-scale simulations are
initialized by a Voronoi diagram for line segments discretized from the
manufacturing toolpath. Lastly, we propose a modified conduction model that
considers the high thermal gradient around the melt pool. We validate the
simulation against melt pool images captured with the co-axial melt pool
monitoring (MPM) system on the NIST Additive Manufacturing Metrology Testbed
(AMMT). Excellent agreements in the length and width of melt pools are found
between simulations and experiments conducted on a custom-controlled laser
powder bed fusion (LPBF) testbed on a nickel-alloy (IN625) solid surface. To
the authors' best knowledge, this paper is the first to validate a full
path-scale thermal history with experimentally acquired melt pool images.
Comparing the simulation results and the experimental data, we discuss the
influence of laser power on the melt pool length on the path-scale level. We
also identify the possible ways to further improve the accuracy of the CAPL
simulation without sacrificing efficiency.

patient zero in an epidemic, or the origin of a rumor in a social network.
Although it is widely acknowledged that random and local gossip communications
make source identification difficult, there exists no general quantification of
the level of anonymity provided to the source. This paper presents a principled
method based on $\varepsilon$-differential privacy to analyze the inherent
source anonymity of gossiping for a large class of graphs. First, we quantify
the fundamental limit of source anonymity any gossip protocol can guarantee in
an arbitrary communication graph. In particular, our result indicates that when
the graph has poor connectivity, no gossip protocol can guarantee any
meaningful level of differential privacy. This prompted us to further analyze
graphs with controlled connectivity. We prove on these graphs that a large
class of gossip protocols, namely cobra walks, offers tangible differential
privacy guarantees to the source. In doing so, we introduce an original proof
technique based on the reduction of a gossip protocol to what we call a random
walk with probabilistic die out. This proof technique is of independent
interest to the gossip community and readily extends to other protocols
inherited from the security community, such as the Dandelion protocol.
Interestingly, our tight analysis precisely captures the trade-off between
dissemination time of a gossip protocol and its source anonymity.

<p class="mathjax">The detection of disfluencies such as hesitations, repetitions and false
starts commonly found in speech is a widely studied area of research. With a
standardised process for evaluation using the Switchboard Corpus, model
performance can be easily compared across approaches. This is not the case for
disfluency detection research on learner speech, however, where such datasets
have restricted access policies, making comparison and subsequent development
of improved models more challenging. To address this issue, this paper
describes the adaptation of the NICT-JLE corpus, containing approximately 300
hours of English learners' oral proficiency tests, to a format that is suitable
for disfluency detection model training and evaluation. Points of difference
between the NICT-JLE and Switchboard corpora are explored, followed by a
detailed overview of adaptations to the tag set and meta-features of the
NICT-JLE corpus. The result of this work provides a standardised train, heldout
and test set for use in future research on disfluency detection for learner
speech.

<p class="mathjax">This paper conducts a comprehensive study of a classical adaptive control
problem: adaptive control of a state-space plant model: $\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) +
B u(t)$ in continuous time, or $x(t+1) = A x(t) + B u(t)$ in discrete time, for
state tracking of a chosen stable reference model system: $\dot{x}_m(t) = A_m
x_m(t) + B_m r(t)$ in continuous time, or $x_m(t+1) = A_m x_m(t) + B_m r(t)$ in
discrete time. Adaptive state tracking control schemes for continuous-time
systems have been reported in the literature, using a Lyapunov design and
analysis method which has not been successfully applied to discrete-time
systems, so that the discrete-time adaptive state tracking problem has remained
to be open. In this paper, new adaptive state tracking control schemes are
developed for discrete-time systems, using a gradient method for the design of
adaptive laws for updating the controller parameters. Both direct and indirect
adaptive designs are presented, which have the standard and desired adaptive
law properties. Such a new gradient algorithm based framework is also developed
for adaptive state tracking control of continuous-time systems, as compared
with the Lyapunov method based framework.

<p class="mathjax">Open-vocabulary segmentation is a challenging task requiring segmenting and
recognizing objects from an open set of categories. One way to address this
challenge is to leverage multi-modal models, such as CLIP, to provide image and
text features in a shared embedding space, which bridges the gap between
closed-vocabulary and open-vocabulary recognition. Hence, existing methods
often adopt a two-stage framework to tackle the problem, where the inputs first
go through a mask generator and then through the CLIP model along with the
predicted masks. This process involves extracting features from images multiple
times, which can be ineffective and inefficient. By contrast, we propose to
build everything into a single-stage framework using a shared Frozen
Convolutional CLIP backbone, which not only significantly simplifies the
current two-stage pipeline, but also remarkably yields a better accuracy-cost
trade-off. The proposed FC-CLIP, benefits from the following observations: the
frozen CLIP backbone maintains the ability of open-vocabulary classification
and can also serve as a strong mask generator, and the convolutional CLIP
generalizes well to a larger input resolution than the one used during
contrastive image-text pretraining. When training on COCO panoptic data only
and testing in a zero-shot manner, FC-CLIP achieve 26.8 PQ, 16.8 AP, and 34.1
mIoU on ADE20K, 18.2 PQ, 27.9 mIoU on Mapillary Vistas, 44.0 PQ, 26.8 AP, 56.2
mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the prior art by +4.2 PQ, +2.4 AP, +4.2 mIoU
on ADE20K, +4.0 PQ on Mapillary Vistas and +20.1 PQ on Cityscapes,
respectively. Additionally, the training and testing time of FC-CLIP is 7.5x
and 6.6x significantly faster than the same prior art, while using 5.9x fewer
parameters. FC-CLIP also sets a new state-of-the-art performance across various
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets. Code at

<p class="mathjax">We propose MM-Vet, an evaluation benchmark that examines large multimodal
models (LMMs) on complicated multimodal tasks. Recent LMMs have shown various
intriguing abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard,
reasoning about events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual
jokes. Rapid model advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark
development. Problems include: (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate
the complicated multimodal tasks; (2) How to design evaluation metrics that
work well across question and answer types; and (3) How to give model insights
beyond a simple performance ranking. To this end, we present MM-Vet, designed
based on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is
often achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core
vision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core VL capabilities and
examines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability
combination. For evaluation metrics, we propose an LLM-based evaluator for
open-ended outputs. The evaluator enables the evaluation across different
question types and answer styles, resulting in a unified scoring metric. We
evaluate representative LMMs on MM-Vet, providing insights into the
capabilities of different LMM system paradigms and models. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/yuweihao/MM-Vet.

<p class="mathjax">The energy transition has increased the reliance on intermittent energy
sources, destabilizing energy markets and causing unprecedented volatility,
culminating in the global energy crisis of 2021. In addition to harming
producers and consumers, volatile energy markets may jeopardize vital
decarbonization efforts. Traders play an important role in stabilizing markets
by providing liquidity and reducing volatility. Several mathematical and
statistical models have been proposed for forecasting future returns. However,
developing such models is non-trivial due to financial markets' low
signal-to-noise ratios and nonstationary dynamics.
<br />This thesis investigates the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning
methods in commodities trading. It formalizes the commodities trading problem
as a continuing discrete-time stochastic dynamical system. This system employs
a novel time-discretization scheme that is reactive and adaptive to market
volatility, providing better statistical properties for the sub-sampled
financial time series. Two policy gradient algorithms, an actor-based and an
actor-critic-based, are proposed for optimizing a transaction-cost- and
risk-sensitive trading agent. The agent maps historical price observations to
market positions through parametric function approximators utilizing deep
neural network architectures, specifically CNNs and LSTMs.
<br />On average, the deep reinforcement learning models produce an 83 percent
higher Sharpe ratio than the buy-and-hold baseline when backtested on
front-month natural gas futures from 2017 to 2022. The backtests demonstrate
that the risk tolerance of the deep reinforcement learning agents can be
adjusted using a risk-sensitivity term. The actor-based policy gradient
algorithm performs significantly better than the actor-critic-based algorithm,
and the CNN-based models perform slightly better than those based on the LSTM.

<p class="mathjax">Nanobodies (Nb) are monomeric heavy-chain fragments derived from heavy-chain
only antibodies naturally found in Camelids and Sharks. Their considerably
small size (~3-4 nm; 13 kDa) and favorable biophysical properties make them
attractive targets for recombinant production. Furthermore, their unique
ability to bind selectively to specific antigens, such as toxins, chemicals,
bacteria, and viruses, makes them powerful tools in cell biology, structural
biology, medical diagnostics, and future therapeutic agents in treating cancer
and other serious illnesses. However, a critical challenge in nanobodies
production is the unavailability of nanobodies for a majority of antigens.
Although some computational methods have been proposed to screen potential
nanobodies for given target antigens, their practical application is highly
restricted due to their reliance on 3D structures. Moreover, predicting
nanobodyantigen interactions (binding) is a time-consuming and labor-intensive
task. This study aims to develop a machine-learning method to predict
Nanobody-Antigen binding solely based on the sequence data. We curated a
comprehensive dataset of Nanobody-Antigen binding and nonbinding data and
devised an embedding method based on gapped k-mers to predict binding based
only on sequences of nanobody and antigen. Our approach achieves up to 90%
accuracy in binding prediction and is significantly more efficient compared to
the widely-used computational docking technique.

<p class="mathjax">Fast screening of drug molecules based on the ligand binding affinity is an
important step in the drug discovery pipeline. Graph neural fingerprint is a
promising method for developing molecular docking surrogates with high
throughput and great fidelity. In this study, we built a COVID-19 drug docking
dataset of about 300,000 drug candidates on 23 coronavirus protein targets.
With this dataset, we trained graph neural fingerprint docking models for
high-throughput virtual COVID-19 drug screening. The graph neural fingerprint
models yield high prediction accuracy on docking scores with the mean squared
error lower than $0.21$ kcal/mol for most of the docking targets, showing
significant improvement over conventional circular fingerprint methods. To make
the neural fingerprints transferable for unknown targets, we also propose a
transferable graph neural fingerprint method trained on multiple targets. With
comparable accuracy to target-specific graph neural fingerprint models, the
transferable model exhibits superb training and data efficiency. We highlight
that the impact of this study extends beyond COVID-19 dataset, as our approach
for fast virtual ligand screening can be easily adapted and integrated into a
general machine learning-accelerated pipeline to battle future bio-threats.

<p class="mathjax">Superconductors have been among the most fascinating substances, as the
fundamental concept of superconductivity as well as the correlation of critical
temperature and superconductive materials have been the focus of extensive
investigation since their discovery. However, superconductors at normal
temperatures have yet to be identified. Additionally, there are still many
unknown factors and gaps of understanding regarding this unique phenomenon,
particularly the connection between superconductivity and the fundamental
criteria to estimate the critical temperature. To bridge the gap, numerous
machine learning techniques have been established to estimate critical
temperatures as it is extremely challenging to determine. Furthermore, the need
for a sophisticated and feasible method for determining the temperature range
that goes beyond the scope of the standard empirical formula appears to be
strongly emphasized by various machine-learning approaches. This paper uses a
stacking machine learning approach to train itself on the complex
characteristics of superconductive materials in order to accurately predict
critical temperatures. In comparison to other previous accessible research
investigations, this model demonstrated a promising performance with an RMSE of
9.68 and an R2 score of 0.922. The findings presented here could be a viable
technique to shed new insight on the efficient implementation of the stacking
ensemble method with hyperparameter optimization (HPO).

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces two novel approaches for Online Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) Regression Problems. We employ a high performance graph-based MTL
formulation and develop its recursive versions based on the Weighted Recursive
Least Squares (WRLS) and the Online Sparse Least Squares Support Vector
Regression (OSLSSVR). Adopting task-stacking transformations, we demonstrate
the existence of a single matrix incorporating the relationship of multiple
tasks and providing structural information to be embodied by the MT-WRLS method
in its initialization procedure and by the MT-OSLSSVR in its multi-task kernel
function. Contrasting the existing literature, which is mostly based on Online
Gradient Descent (OGD) or cubic inexact approaches, we achieve exact and
approximate recursions with quadratic per-instance cost on the dimension of the
input space (MT-WRLS) or on the size of the dictionary of instances
(MT-OSLSSVR). We compare our online MTL methods to other contenders in a
real-world wind speed forecasting case study, evidencing the significant gain
in performance of both proposed approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have
paved the way for unprecedented opportunities for understanding the complexity
of the brain and its emulation by computational systems. Cutting-edge
advancements in neuroscience research have revealed the intricate relationship
between brain structure and function, while the success of artificial neural
networks highlights the importance of network architecture. Now is the time to
bring them together to better unravel how intelligence emerges from the brain's
multiscale repositories. In this review, we propose the Digital Twin Brain
(DTB) as a transformative platform that bridges the gap between biological and
artificial intelligence. It consists of three core elements: the brain
structure that is fundamental to the twinning process, bottom-layer models to
generate brain functions, and its wide spectrum of applications. Crucially,
brain atlases provide a vital constraint, preserving the brain's network
organization within the DTB. Furthermore, we highlight open questions that
invite joint efforts from interdisciplinary fields and emphasize the
far-reaching implications of the DTB. The DTB can offer unprecedented insights
into the emergence of intelligence and neurological disorders, which holds
tremendous promise for advancing our understanding of both biological and
artificial intelligence, and ultimately propelling the development of
artificial general intelligence and facilitating precision mental healthcare.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce CartiMorph, a framework for automated knee articular cartilage
morphometrics. It takes an image as input and generates quantitative metrics
for cartilage subregions, including the percentage of full-thickness cartilage
loss (FCL), mean thickness, surface area, and volume. CartiMorph leverages the
power of deep learning models for hierarchical image feature representation.
Deep learning models were trained and validated for tissue segmentation,
template construction, and template-to-image registration. We established
methods for surface-normal-based cartilage thickness mapping, FCL estimation,
and rule-based cartilage parcellation. Our cartilage thickness map showed less
error in thin and peripheral regions. We evaluated the effectiveness of the
adopted segmentation model by comparing the quantitative metrics obtained from
model segmentation and those from manual segmentation. The root-mean-squared
deviation of the FCL measurements was less than 8%, and strong correlations
were observed for the mean thickness (Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho
\in [0.82,0.97]$), surface area ($\rho \in [0.82,0.98]$) and volume ($\rho \in
[0.89,0.98]$) measurements. We compared our FCL measurements with those from a
previous study and found that our measurements deviated less from the ground
truths. We observed superior performance of the proposed rule-based cartilage
parcellation method compared with the atlas-based approach. CartiMorph has the
potential to promote imaging biomarkers discovery for knee osteoarthritis.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the advances in machine learning and digital pathology, it is not yet
clear if machine learning methods can accurately predict molecular information
merely from histomorphology. In a quest to answer this question, we built a
large-scale dataset (185538 images) with reliable measurements for Ki67, ER,
PR, and HER2 statuses. The dataset is composed of mirrored images of H\&amp;E and
corresponding images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays (Ki67, ER, PR, and
HER2. These images are mirrored through registration. To increase reliability,
individual pairs were inspected and discarded if artifacts were present (tissue
folding, bubbles, etc). Measurements for Ki67, ER and PR were determined by
calculating H-Score from image analysis. HER2 measurement is based on binary
classification: 0 and 1+ (IHC scores representing a negative subset) vs 3+ (IHC
score positive subset). Cases with IHC equivocal score (2+) were excluded. We
show that a standard ViT-based pipeline can achieve prediction performances
around 90% in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) when trained with a proper
labeling protocol. Finally, we shed light on the ability of the trained
classifiers to localize relevant regions, which encourages future work to
improve the localizations. Our proposed dataset is publicly available:

<p class="mathjax">Clinical decision making from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combines
complementary information from multiple MRI sequences (defined as
'modalities'). MRI image registration aims to geometrically 'pair' diagnoses
from different modalities, time points and slices. Both intra- and
inter-modality MRI registration are essential components in clinical MRI
settings. Further, an MRI image processing pipeline that can address both afine
and non-rigid registration is critical, as both types of deformations may be
occuring in real MRI data scenarios. Unlike image classification,
explainability is not commonly addressed in image registration deep learning
(DL) methods, as it is challenging to interpet model-data behaviours against
transformation fields. To properly address this, we incorporate Grad-CAM-based
explainability frameworks in each major component of our unsupervised
multi-modal and multi-organ image registration DL methodology. We previously
demonstrated that we were able to reach superior performance (against the
current standard Syn method). In this work, we show that our DL model becomes
fully explainable, setting the framework to generalise our approach on further
medical imaging data.

<p class="mathjax">We present the NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK, a state-of-the-art library of composable
primitives for GPU-accelerated quantum circuit simulations. As the size of
quantum devices continues to increase, making their classical simulation
progressively more difficult, the availability of fast and scalable quantum
circuit simulators becomes vital for quantum algorithm developers, as well as
quantum hardware engineers focused on the validation and optimization of
quantum devices. The cuQuantum SDK was created to accelerate and scale up
quantum circuit simulators developed by the quantum information science
community by enabling them to utilize efficient scalable software building
blocks optimized for NVIDIA GPU platforms. The functional building blocks
provided cover the needs of both state vector- and tensor network- based
simulators, including approximate tensor network simulation methods based on
matrix product state, projected entangled pair state, and other factorized
tensor representations. By leveraging the enormous computing power of the
latest NVIDIA GPU architectures, quantum circuit simulators that have adopted
the cuQuantum SDK demonstrate significant acceleration, compared to CPU-only
execution, for both the state vector and tensor network simulation methods.
Furthermore, by utilizing the parallel primitives available in the cuQuantum
SDK, one can easily transition to distributed GPU-accelerated platforms,
including those furnished by cloud service providers and high-performance
computing systems deployed by supercomputing centers, extending the scale of
possible quantum circuit simulations. The rich capabilities provided by the SDK
are conveniently made available via both Python and C application programming
interfaces, where the former is directly targeting a broad Python quantum
community and the latter allows tight integration with simulators written in
any programming language.

<p class="mathjax">The paper introduces robust independence tests with non-asymptotically
guaranteed significance levels for stochastic linear time-invariant systems,
assuming that the observed outputs are synchronous, which means that the
systems are driven by jointly i.i.d. noises. Our method provides bounds for the
type I error probabilities that are distribution-free, i.e., the innovations
can have arbitrary distributions. The algorithm combines confidence region
estimates with permutation tests and general dependence measures, such as the
Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion and the distance covariance, to detect
any nonlinear dependence between the observed systems. We also prove the
consistency of our hypothesis tests under mild assumptions and demonstrate the
ideas through the example of autoregressive systems.

<p class="mathjax">Segmentation masks of pathological areas are useful in many medical
applications, such as brain tumour and stroke management. Moreover, healthy
counterfactuals of diseased images can be used to enhance radiologists'
training files and to improve the interpretability of segmentation models. In
this work, we present a weakly supervised method to generate a healthy version
of a diseased image and then use it to obtain a pixel-wise anomaly map. To do
so, we start by considering a saliency map that approximately covers the
pathological areas, obtained with ACAT. Then, we propose a technique that
allows to perform targeted modifications to these regions, while preserving the
rest of the image. In particular, we employ a diffusion model trained on
healthy samples and combine Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) at each step of the sampling process.
DDPM is used to modify the areas affected by a lesion within the saliency map,
while DDIM guarantees reconstruction of the normal anatomy outside of it. The
two parts are also fused at each timestep, to guarantee the generation of a
sample with a coherent appearance and a seamless transition between edited and
unedited parts. We verify that when our method is applied to healthy samples,
the input images are reconstructed without significant modifications. We
compare our approach with alternative weakly supervised methods on IST-3 for
stroke lesion segmentation and on BraTS2021 for brain tumour segmentation,
where we improve the DICE score of the best competing method from $0.6534$ to
$0.7056$.

<p class="mathjax">For a large class of random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), deep but
non-rigorous theory from statistical physics predict the location of the sharp
satisfiability transition. The works of Ding, Sly, Sun (2014, 2016) and
Coja-Oghlan, Panagiotou (2014) established the satisfiability threshold for
random regular $k$-NAE-SAT, random $k$-SAT, and random regular $k$-SAT for
large enough $k\geq k_0$ where $k_0$ is a large non-explicit constant.
Establishing the same for small values of $k\geq 3$ remains an important open
problem in the study of random CSPs.
<br />In this work, we study two closely related models of random CSPs, namely the
$2$-coloring on random $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs and the random
$d$-regular $k$-NAE-SAT model. For every $k\geq 3$, we prove that there is an
explicit $d_{\ast}(k)$ which gives a satisfiability upper bound for both of the
models. Our upper bound $d_{\ast}(k)$ for $k\geq 3$ matches the prediction from
statistical physics for the hypergraph $2$-coloring by Dall'Asta, Ramezanpour,
Zecchina (2008), thus conjectured to be sharp. Moreover, $d_{\ast}(k)$
coincides with the satisfiability threshold of random regular $k$-NAE-SAT for
large enough $k\geq k_0$ by Ding, Sly, Sun (2014).

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS) orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar system capable of reducing the
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling rate in OFDM radar without any
additional manipulations of its hardware and waveform. To this end, the
proposed system utilizes the ADC sampling rate of B/L to sample the received
baseband signal with a bandwidth of B, where L is a positive proper divisor of
the number of subcarriers. This divides the baseband signal into L sub-bands,
folding into a sub-Nyquist frequency band due to aliasing. By leveraging known
modulation symbols of the transmitted signal, the folded signal can be unfolded
to the full-band signal. This allows an estimation of target ranges with the
range resolution of the full signal bandwidth B without the degradation of the
maximum unambiguous range. During the signal-unfolding process, the signals
from other sub-bands remain as symbol-mismatch noise (SMN), which significantly
degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detected targets. It also
causes weaker targets to be submerged under the noise in range profiles. To
resolve this, a symbol-mismatch noise cancellation (SMNC) technique is also
proposed, which reconstructs the interfering signals from the other sub-bands
using the detected targets and subtracts them from the unfolded signal. As a
result, the proposed sub-Nyquist sampling OFDM radar and corresponding signal
processing technique enable a reduction in the ADC sampling rate by the ratio
of L while incurring only a 10 log10 L increase in the noise due to noise
folding. This is validated through simulations and measurements with various
sub-sampling ratios.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents weighted stochastic Riccati (WSR) equations for designing
multiple types of optimal controllers for linear stochastic systems. The
stochastic system matrices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
to represent uncertainty and noise in the systems. However, it is difficult to
design multiple types of controllers for systems with i.i.d. matrices while the
stochasticity can invoke unpredictable control results. A critical limitation
of such i.i.d. systems is that Riccati-like algebraic equations cannot be
applied to complex controller design. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
WSR equations employ a weighted expectation of stochastic algebraic equations.
The weighted expectation is calculated using a weight function designed to
handle statistical properties of the control policy. Solutions to the WSR
equations provide multiple policies depending on the weight function, which
contain the deterministic optimal, stochastic optimal, and risk-sensitive
linear (RSL) control. This study presents two approaches to solve the WSR
equations efficiently: calculating WSR difference equations iteratively and
employing Newton's method. Moreover, designing the weight function yields a
novel controller termed the robust RSL controller that has both a
risk-sensitive policy and robustness to randomness occurring in stochastic
control design.

<p class="mathjax">CT scans are the standard-of-care for many clinical ailments, and are needed
for treatments like external beam radiotherapy. Unfortunately, CT scanners are
rare in low and mid-resource settings due to their costs. Planar X-ray
radiography units, in comparison, are far more prevalent, but can only provide
limited 2D observations of the 3D anatomy. In this work, we propose a method to
generate CT volumes from few (&lt;5) planar X-ray observations using a prior data
distribution, and perform the first evaluation of such a reconstruction
algorithm for a clinical application: radiotherapy planning. We propose a deep
generative model, building on advances in neural implicit representations to
synthesize volumetric CT scans from few input planar X-ray images at different
angles. To focus the generation task on clinically-relevant features, our model
can also leverage anatomical guidance during training (via segmentation masks).
We generated 2-field opposed, palliative radiotherapy plans on thoracic CTs
reconstructed by our method, and found that isocenter radiation dose on
reconstructed scans have &lt;1% error with respect to the dose calculated on
clinically acquired CTs using &lt;=4 X-ray views. In addition, our method is
better than recent sparse CT reconstruction baselines in terms of standard
pixel and structure-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM, Dice score) on the public LIDC
lung CT dataset. Code is available at: https://github.com/wanderinrain/Xray2CT.

<p class="mathjax">Capturing global contextual information plays a critical role in breast
ultrasound (BUS) image classification. Although convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have demonstrated reliable performance in tumor classification, they
have inherent limitations for modeling global and long-range dependencies due
to the localized nature of convolution operations. Vision Transformers have an
improved capability of capturing global contextual information but may distort
the local image patterns due to the tokenization operations. In this study, we
proposed a hybrid multitask deep neural network called Hybrid-MT-ESTAN,
designed to perform BUS tumor classification and segmentation using a hybrid
architecture composed of CNNs and Swin Transformer components. The proposed
approach was compared to nine BUS classification methods and evaluated using
seven quantitative metrics on a dataset of 3,320 BUS images. The results
indicate that Hybrid-MT-ESTAN achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and
F1 score of 82.7%, 86.4%, and 86.0%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">In multi-objective optimization, a single decision vector must balance the
trade-offs between many objectives. Solutions achieving an optimal trade-off
are said to be Pareto optimal: these are decision vectors for which improving
any one objective must come at a cost to another. But as the set of Pareto
optimal vectors can be very large, we further consider a more practically
significant Pareto-constrained optimization problem, where the goal is to
optimize a preference function constrained to the Pareto set.
<br />We investigate local methods for solving this constrained optimization
problem, which poses significant challenges because the constraint set is (i)
implicitly defined, and (ii) generally non-convex and non-smooth, even when the
objectives are. We define notions of optimality and stationarity, and provide
an algorithm with a last-iterate convergence rate of $O(K^{-1/2})$ to
stationarity when the objectives are strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a first implementation of a novel
likelihood-ratio-based approach for constructing confidence intervals for
neural networks. Our method, called DeepLR, offers several qualitative
advantages: most notably, the ability to construct asymmetric intervals that
expand in regions with a limited amount of data, and the inherent incorporation
of factors such as the amount of training time, network architecture, and
regularization techniques. While acknowledging that the current implementation
of the method is prohibitively expensive for many deep-learning applications,
the high cost may already be justified in specific fields like medical
predictions or astrophysics, where a reliable uncertainty estimate for a single
prediction is essential. This work highlights the significant potential of a
likelihood-ratio-based uncertainty estimate and establishes a promising avenue
for future research.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing adoption of econometric and machine-learning approaches by
empirical researchers has led to a widespread use of one data collection
method: web scraping. Web scraping refers to the use of automated computer
programs to access websites and download their content. The key argument of
this paper is that na\"ive web scraping procedures can lead to sampling bias in
the collected data. This article describes three sources of sampling bias in
web-scraped data. More specifically, sampling bias emerges from web content
being volatile (i.e., being subject to change), personalized (i.e., presented
in response to request characteristics), and unindexed (i.e., abundance of a
population register). In a series of examples, I illustrate the prevalence and
magnitude of sampling bias. To support researchers and reviewers, this paper
provides recommendations on anticipating, detecting, and overcoming sampling
bias in web-scraped data.

<p class="mathjax">While highly expressive parametric models including deep neural networks have
an advantage to model complicated concepts, training such highly non-linear
models is known to yield a high risk of notorious overfitting. To address this
issue, this study considers a $k$th order total variation ($k$-TV)
regularization, which is defined as the squared integral of the $k$th order
derivative of the parametric models to be trained; penalizing the $k$-TV is
expected to yield a smoother function, which is expected to avoid overfitting.
While the $k$-TV terms applied to general parametric models are computationally
intractable due to the integration, this study provides a stochastic
optimization algorithm, that can efficiently train general models with the
$k$-TV regularization without conducting explicit numerical integration. The
proposed approach can be applied to the training of even deep neural networks
whose structure is arbitrary, as it can be implemented by only a simple
stochastic gradient descent algorithm and automatic differentiation. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate that the neural networks trained with the
$K$-TV terms are more ``resilient'' than those with the conventional parameter
regularization. The proposed algorithm also can be extended to the
physics-informed training of neural networks (PINNs).

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance for
diverse practical applications. However, it is susceptible to the severe
spectrum scarcity problem and interference since it operates in the unlicensed
spectrum band. In order to tackle those issues, a dynamic spectrum sharing
network is considered with the anti-jamming technique. Moreover, an intelligent
spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is proposed to adapt to
diverse jamming models by exploiting our designed novel online-offline
multi-agent actor-critic and deep deterministic policy-gradient framework.
Simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed framework.
It is also shown that our proposed scheme achieves the largest transmission

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: In this work, we present a workflow to construct generic and robust
generative image priors from magnitude-only images. The priors can then be used
for regularization in reconstruction to improve image quality. Methods: The
workflow begins with the preparation of training datasets from magnitude-only
MR images. This dataset is then augmented with phase information and used to
train generative priors of complex images. Finally, trained priors are
evaluated using both linear and nonlinear reconstruction for compressed sensing
parallel imaging with various undersampling schemes. Results: The results of
our experiments demonstrate that priors trained on complex images outperform
priors trained only on magnitude images. Additionally, a prior trained on a
larger dataset exhibits higher robustness. Finally, we show that the generative
priors are superior to L1 -wavelet regularization for compressed sensing
parallel imaging with high undersampling. Conclusion: These findings stress the
importance of incorporating phase information and leveraging large datasets to
raise the performance and reliability of the generative priors for MRI
reconstruction. Phase augmentation makes it possible to use existing image
databases for training.

<p class="mathjax">The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate
algorithm for solving optimization problems on quantum computers. However, the
potential of QAOA to tackle classically intractable problems remains unclear.
In this paper, we perform an extensive numerical investigation of QAOA on the
Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS) problem. The rapid growth of the
problem's complexity with the number of spins $N$ makes it classically
intractable even for moderately sized instances, with the best-known heuristics
observed to fail to find a good solution for problems with $N \gtrapprox 200$.
We perform noiseless simulations with up to 40 qubits and observe that out to
this system size, the runtime of QAOA with fixed parameters and a constant
number of layers scales better than branch-and-bound solvers, which are the
state-of-the-art exact solvers for LABS. The combination of QAOA with quantum
minimum-finding on an idealized quantum computer gives the best empirical
scaling of any algorithm for the LABS problem. We demonstrate experimental
progress in compiling and executing QAOA for the LABS problem using an
algorithm-specific error detection scheme on Quantinuum trapped-ion processors.
Our results provide evidence for the utility of QAOA as an algorithmic
component when executed on an idealized quantum computer.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the problem of estimating the structure of a weighted network
from repeated measurements of a Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) on the network.
In this vein, we consider GGMs whose covariance structures align with the
geometry of the weighted network on which they are based. Such GGMs have been
of longstanding interest in statistical physics, and are referred to as the
Gaussian Free Field (GFF). In recent years, they have attracted considerable
interest in the machine learning and theoretical computer science. In this
work, we propose a novel estimator for the weighted network (equivalently, its
Laplacian) from repeated measurements of a GFF on the network, based on the
Fourier analytic properties of the Gaussian distribution. In this pursuit, our
approach exploits complex-valued statistics constructed from observed data,
that are of interest on their own right. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our estimator with concrete recovery guarantees and bounds on the required
sample complexity. In particular, we show that the proposed statistic achieves
the parametric rate of estimation for fixed network size. In the setting of
networks growing with sample size, our results show that for Erdos-Renyi random
graphs $G(d,p)$ above the connectivity threshold, we demonstrate that network
recovery takes place with high probability as soon as the sample size $n$
satisfies $n \gg d^4 \log d \cdot p^{-2}$.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models usually require sufficient training data to achieve high
accuracy, but obtaining labeled data can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Here we introduce a template-based training method to train a 3D U-Net model
from scratch using only one population-averaged brain MRI template and its
associated segmentation label. The process incorporated visual perception
augmentation to enhance the model's robustness in handling diverse image inputs
and mitigating overfitting. Leveraging this approach, we trained 3D U-Net
models for mouse, rat, marmoset, rhesus, and human brain MRI to achieve
segmentation tasks such as skull-stripping, brain segmentation, and tissue
probability mapping. This tool effectively addresses the limited availability
of training data and holds significant potential for expanding deep learning
applications in image analysis, providing researchers with a unified solution
to train deep neural networks with only one image sample.

<p class="mathjax">This paper study provides a novel contribution to the field of signal
processing and DL for ECG signal analysis by introducing a new feature
representation method for ECG signals. The proposed method is based on
transforming time frequency 1D vectors into 2D images using Gramian Angular
Field transform. Moving on, the classification of the transformed ECG signals
is performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The obtained results
show a classification accuracy of 97.47% and 98.65% for anomaly detection.
Accordingly, in addition to improving the classification performance compared
to the state-of-the-art, the feature representation helps identify and
visualize temporal patterns in the ECG signal, such as changes in heart rate,
rhythm, and morphology, which may not be apparent in the original signal. This
has significant implications in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular
diseases and detection of anomalies.

<p class="mathjax">Human presence detection in indoor environments using millimeter-wave
frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar is challenging due to the
presence of moving and stationary clutters in indoor places. This work proposes
"HOOD" as a real-time robust human presence and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection method by exploiting 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar. We approach the
presence detection application as an OOD detection problem and solve the two
problems simultaneously using a single pipeline. Our solution relies on a
reconstruction-based architecture and works with radar macro and micro
range-Doppler images (RDIs). HOOD aims to accurately detect the "presence" of
humans in the presence or absence of moving and stationary disturbers. Since it
is also an OOD detector, it aims to detect moving or stationary clutters as OOD
in humans' absence and predicts the current scene's output as "no presence."
HOOD is an activity-free approach that performs well in different human
scenarios. On our dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW Radar, we
achieve an average AUROC of 94.36%. Additionally, our extensive evaluations and
experiments demonstrate that HOOD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) OOD
detection methods in terms of common OOD detection metrics. Our real-time
experiments are available at: https://muskahya.github.io/HOOD

<p class="mathjax">Human Pose Estimation (HPE) to assess human motion in sports, rehabilitation
or work safety requires accurate sensing without compromising the sensitive
underlying personal data. Therefore, local processing is necessary and the
limited energy budget in such systems can be addressed by Inertial Measurement
Units (IMU) instead of common camera sensing. The central trade-off between
accuracy and efficient use of hardware resources is rarely discussed in
research. We address this trade-off by a simulative Design Space Exploration
(DSE) of a varying quantity and positioning of IMU-sensors. First, we generate
IMU-data from a publicly available body model dataset for different sensor
configurations and train a deep learning model with this data. Additionally, we
propose a combined metric to assess the accuracy-resource trade-off. We used
the DSE as a tool to evaluate sensor configurations and identify beneficial
ones for a specific use case. Exemplary, for a system with equal importance of
accuracy and resources, we identify an optimal sensor configuration of 4
sensors with a mesh error of 6.03 cm, increasing the accuracy by 32.7% and
reducing the hardware effort by two sensors compared to state of the art. Our
work can be used to design health applications with well-suited sensor
positioning and attention to data privacy and resource-awareness.

<p class="mathjax">Electroencephalography (EEG) decoding is a challenging task due to the
limited availability of labelled data. While transfer learning is a promising
technique to address this challenge, it assumes that transferable data domains
and task are known, which is not the case in this setting. This study
investigates the transferability of deep learning representations between
different EEG decoding tasks. We conduct extensive experiments using
state-of-the-art decoding models on two recently released EEG datasets, ERP
CORE and M$^3$CV, containing over 140 subjects and 11 distinct cognitive tasks.
We measure the transferability of learned representations by pre-training deep
neural networks on one task and assessing their ability to decode subsequent
tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that, even with linear probing transfer,
significant improvements in decoding performance can be obtained, with gains of
up to 28% compare with the pure supervised approach. Additionally, we discover
evidence that certain decoding paradigms elicit specific and narrow brain
activities, while others benefit from pre-training on a broad range of
representations. By revealing which tasks transfer well and demonstrating the
benefits of transfer learning for EEG decoding, our findings have practical
implications for mitigating data scarcity in this setting. The transfer maps
generated also provide insights into the hierarchical relations between
cognitive tasks, hence enhancing our understanding of how these tasks are
connected from a neuroscientific standpoint.

<p class="mathjax">The human brain is in a continuous state of activity during both work and
rest. Mental activity is a daily process, and when the brain is overworked, it
can have negative effects on human health. In recent years, great attention has
been paid to early detection of mental health problems because it can help
prevent serious health problems and improve quality of life. Several signals
are used to assess mental state, but the electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely
used by researchers because of the large amount of information it provides
about the brain. This paper aims to classify mental workload into three states
and estimate continuum levels. Our method combines multiple dimensions of space
to achieve the best results for mental estimation. In the time domain approach,
we use Temporal Convolutional Networks, and in the frequency domain, we propose
a new architecture called the Multi-Dimensional Residual Block, which combines
residual blocks.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, with the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi
CSI-based HAR has gained increasing attention from academic and industry
communities. By integrating the deep learning technology with CSI-based HAR,
researchers achieve state-of-the-art performance without the need of expert
knowledge. However, the scarcity of labeled CSI data remains the most prominent
challenge when applying deep learning models in the context of CSI-based HAR
due to the privacy and incomprehensibility of CSI-based HAR data. On the other
hand, SSL has emerged as a promising approach for learning meaningful
representations from data without heavy reliance on labeled examples.
Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to address the challenge of
insufficient data in deep learning by leveraging SSL algorithms. In this paper,
we undertake a comprehensive inventory and analysis of the potential held by
different categories of SSL algorithms, including those that have been
previously studied and those that have not yet been explored, within the field.
We provide an in-depth investigation of SSL algorithms in the context of WiFi
CSI-based HAR. We evaluate four categories of SSL algorithms using three
publicly available CSI HAR datasets, each encompassing different tasks and
environmental settings. To ensure relevance to real-world applications, we
design performance metrics that align with specific requirements. Furthermore,
our experimental findings uncover several limitations and blind spots in
existing work, highlighting the barriers that need to be addressed before SSL
can be effectively deployed in real-world WiFi-based HAR applications. Our
results also serve as a practical guideline for industry practitioners and
provide valuable insights for future research endeavors in this field.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the scientific progress of Advanced Driver Assistance System
solutions (ADAS) has played a key role in enhancing the overall safety of
driving. ADAS technology enables active control of vehicles to prevent
potentially risky situations. An important aspect that researchers have focused
on is the analysis of the driver attention level, as recent reports confirmed a
rising number of accidents caused by drowsiness or lack of attentiveness. To
address this issue, various studies have suggested monitoring the driver
physiological state, as there exists a well-established connection between the
Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and the level of attention. For our study, we
designed an innovative bio-sensor comprising near-infrared LED emitters and
photo-detectors, specifically a Silicon PhotoMultiplier device. This allowed us
to assess the driver physiological status by analyzing the associated
PhotoPlethysmography (PPG) signal.Furthermore, we developed an embedded
time-domain hyper-filtering technique in conjunction with a 1D Temporal
Convolutional architecture that embdes a progressive dilation setup. This
integrated system enables near real-time classification of driver drowsiness,
yielding remarkable accuracy levels of approximately 96%.

<p class="mathjax">Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to
support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying
arrhythmia from electrocardiograms (ECGs). However, forming a CDSS for the
arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of
arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed
methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that
consists of (i) local temporal information extraction, (ii) global pattern
extraction, and (iii) local-global information fusion with attention to perform
arrhythmia detection and classification with a constrained input length. The
10-class and 4-class performances of our approach were assessed by detecting
the onset and offset of arrhythmia as an episode and the duration of arrhythmia
based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and MIT-BIH atrial
fibrillation database (AFDB), respectively. The results were statistically
superior to those achieved by the comparison models. To check the
generalization ability of the proposed method, an AFDB-trained model was tested
on the MITDB, and superior performance was attained compared with that of a
state-of-the-art model. The proposed method can capture local-global
information and dynamics without incurring information losses. Therefore,
arrhythmias can be recognized more accurately, and their occurrence times can
be calculated; thus, the clinical field can create more accurate treatment
plans by using the proposed method.

both per-frame and per-frequency window length of the short-time Fourier

<p class="mathjax">Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive, debilitating
neurodegenerative disease which causes motor symptoms including gait
dysfunction. Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods with a positive
response to levodopa therapy ("on") and periods marked by re-emergency of PD
symptoms ("off") as the response to medication wears off. These fluctuations
often affect gait speed and they increase in their disabling impact as PD
progresses. To improve the effectiveness of current indoor localisation
methods, a transformer-based approach utilising dual modalities which provide
complementary views of movement, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and
accelerometer data from wearable devices, is proposed. A sub-objective aims to
evaluate whether indoor localisation, including its in-home gait speed features
(i.e. the time taken to walk between rooms), could be used to evaluate motor
fluctuations by detecting whether the person with PD is taking levodopa
medications or withholding them. To properly evaluate our proposed method, we
use a free-living dataset where the movements and mobility are greatly varied
and unstructured as expected in real-world conditions. 24 participants lived in
pairs (consisting of one person with PD, one control) for five days in a smart
home with various sensors. Our evaluation on the resulting dataset demonstrates
that our proposed network outperforms other methods for indoor localisation.
The sub-objective evaluation shows that precise room-level localisation
predictions, transformed into in-home gait speed features, produce accurate
predictions on whether the PD participant is taking or withholding their
medications.

<p class="mathjax">Automated exercise repetition counting has applications across the physical
fitness realm, from personal health to rehabilitation. Motivated by the
ubiquity of mobile phones and the benefits of tracking physical activity, this
study explored the feasibility of counting exercise repetitions in real-time,
using only on-device inference, on smartphones. In this work, after providing
an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art automatic exercise repetition
counting methods, we introduce a deep learning based exercise repetition
counting system for smartphones consisting of five components: (1) Pose
estimation, (2) Thresholding, (3) Optical flow, (4) State machine, and (5)
Counter. The system is then implemented via a cross-platform mobile application
named P\=uioio that uses only the smartphone camera to track repetitions in
real time for three standard exercises: Squats, Push-ups, and Pull-ups. The
proposed system was evaluated via a dataset of pre-recorded videos of
individuals exercising as well as testing by subjects exercising in real time.
Evaluation results indicated the system was 98.89% accurate in real-world tests
and up to 98.85% when evaluated via the pre-recorded dataset. This makes it an
effective, low-cost, and convenient alternative to existing solutions since the
proposed system has minimal hardware requirements without requiring any
wearable or specific sensors or network connectivity.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a differentiable version of the short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) that allows for gradient-based optimization of the hop length
or the frame temporal position by making these parameters continuous. Our
approach provides improved control over the temporal positioning of frames, as
the continuous nature of the hop length allows for a more finely-tuned
optimization. Furthermore, our contribution enables the use of optimization
methods such as gradient descent, which are more computationally efficient than
conventional discrete optimization methods. Our differentiable STFT can also be
easily integrated into existing algorithms and neural networks. We present a
simulated illustration to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and to

<p class="mathjax">Hypertension is commonly referred to as the "silent killer", since it can
lead to severe health complications without any visible symptoms. Early
detection of hypertension is crucial in preventing significant health issues.
Although some studies suggest a relationship between blood pressure and certain
vital signals, such as Photoplethysmogram (PPG), reliable generalization of the
proposed blood pressure estimation methods is not yet guaranteed. This lack of
certainty has resulted in some studies doubting the existence of such
relationships, or considering them weak and limited to heart rate and blood
pressure. In this paper, a high-dimensional representation technique based on
random convolution kernels is proposed for hypertension detection using PPG
signals. The results show that this relationship extends beyond heart rate and
blood pressure, demonstrating the feasibility of hypertension detection with
generalization. Additionally, the utilized transform using convolution kernels,
as an end-to-end time-series feature extractor, outperforms the methods
proposed in the previous studies and state-of-the-art deep learning models.

<p class="mathjax">Over many decades, research is being attempted for the removal of noise in
the ambulatory EEG. In this respect, an enormous number of research papers is
published for identification of noise removal, It is difficult to present a
detailed review of all these literature. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt
has been made to review the detection and removal of an noise. More than 100
research papers have been discussed to discern the techniques for detecting and
removal the ambulatory EEG. Further, the literature survey shows that the
pattern recognition required to detect ambulatory method, eye open and close,
varies with different conditions of EEG datasets. This is mainly due to the
fact that EEG detected under different conditions has different
characteristics. This is, in turn, necessitates the identification of pattern
recognition technique to effectively distinguish EEG noise data from a various
condition of EEG data.

paper, we present a novel approach to pruning neural networks utilizing
Bayesian inference, which can seamlessly integrate into the training procedure.
Our proposed method leverages the posterior probabilities of the neural network
prior to and following pruning, enabling the calculation of Bayes factors. The
calculated Bayes factors guide the iterative pruning. Through comprehensive
evaluations conducted on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method
achieves desired levels of sparsity while maintaining competitive accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">It is well known that, when numerically simulating solutions to SDEs,
achieving a strong convergence rate better than O(\sqrt{h}) (where h is the
step size) requires the use of certain iterated integrals of Brownian motion,
commonly referred to as its "L\'{e}vy areas". However, these stochastic
integrals are difficult to simulate due to their non-Gaussian nature and for a
d-dimensional Brownian motion with d &gt; 2, no fast almost-exact sampling
algorithm is known.
<br />In this paper, we propose L\'{e}vyGAN, a deep-learning-based model for
generating approximate samples of L\'{e}vy area conditional on a Brownian
increment. Due to our "Bridge-flipping" operation, the output samples match all
joint and conditional odd moments exactly. Our generator employs a tailored
GNN-inspired architecture, which enforces the correct dependency structure
between the output distribution and the conditioning variable. Furthermore, we
incorporate a mathematically principled characteristic-function based
discriminator. Lastly, we introduce a novel training mechanism termed
"Chen-training", which circumvents the need for expensive-to-generate training
data-sets. This new training procedure is underpinned by our two main
theoretical results.
<br />For 4-dimensional Brownian motion, we show that L\'{e}vyGAN exhibits
state-of-the-art performance across several metrics which measure both the
joint and marginal distributions. We conclude with a numerical experiment on
the log-Heston model, a popular SDE in mathematical finance, demonstrating that
high-quality synthetic L\'{e}vy area can lead to high order weak convergence
and variance reduction when using multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC).

contributions from the climate-change signals, and to help in forecasting sea
level change in the future, we turn to climate model simulations. This work
presents a machine learning framework that exploits both satellite observations
and climate model simulations to generate sea level rise projections at a
2-degree resolution spatial grid, 30 years into the future. We train fully
connected neural networks (FCNNs) to predict altimeter values through a
non-linear fusion of the climate model hindcasts (for 1993-2019). The learned
FCNNs are then applied to future climate model projections to predict future
sea level patterns. We propose segmenting our spatial dataset into meaningful
clusters and show that clustering helps to improve predictions of our ML model.

<p class="mathjax">Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are known to be universal approximators of
dynamic systems under fairly mild and general assumptions, making them good
tools to process temporal information. However, RNNs usually suffer from the
issues of vanishing and exploding gradients in the standard RNN training.
Reservoir computing (RC), a special RNN where the recurrent weights are
randomized and left untrained, has been introduced to overcome these issues and
has demonstrated superior empirical performance in fields as diverse as natural
language processing and wireless communications especially in scenarios where
training samples are extremely limited. On the contrary, the theoretical
grounding to support this observed performance has not been fully developed at
the same pace. In this work, we show that RNNs can provide universal
approximation of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Specifically, we show
that RC can universally approximate a general LTI system. We present a clear
signal processing interpretation of RC and utilize this understanding in the
problem of simulating a generic LTI system through RC. Under this setup, we
analytically characterize the optimal probability distribution function for
generating the recurrent weights of the underlying RNN of the RC. We provide
extensive numerical evaluations to validate the optimality of the derived
optimum distribution of the recurrent weights of the RC for the LTI system
simulation problem. Our work results in clear signal processing-based model
interpretability of RC and provides theoretical explanation for the power of
randomness in setting instead of training RC's recurrent weights. It further
provides a complete optimum analytical characterization for the untrained
recurrent weights, marking an important step towards explainable machine
learning (XML) which is extremely important for applications where training
samples are limited.
