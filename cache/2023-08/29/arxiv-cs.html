<p class="mathjax">Conversational AI systems have emerged as key enablers of human-like
interactions across diverse sectors. Nevertheless, the balance between
linguistic nuance and factual accuracy has proven elusive. In this paper, we
first introduce LLMXplorer, a comprehensive tool that provides an in-depth
review of over 150 Large Language Models (LLMs), elucidating their myriad
implications ranging from social and ethical to regulatory, as well as their
applicability across industries. Building on this foundation, we propose a
novel functional architecture that seamlessly integrates the structured
dynamics of Knowledge Graphs with the linguistic capabilities of LLMs.
Validated using real-world AI news data, our architecture adeptly blends
linguistic sophistication with factual rigour and further strengthens data
security through Role-Based Access Control. This research provides insights
into the evolving landscape of conversational AI, emphasizing the imperative
for systems that are efficient, transparent, and trustworthy.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, in the field of recommendation systems, linear regression
(autoencoder) models have been investigated as a way to learn item similarity.
In this paper, we show a connection between a linear autoencoder model and ZCA
whitening for recommendation data. In particular, we show that the dual form
solution of a linear autoencoder model actually has ZCA whitening effects on
feature vectors of items, while items are considered as input features in the
primal problem of the autoencoder/regression model. We also show the
correctness of applying a linear autoencoder to low-dimensional item vectors
obtained using embedding methods such as Item2vec to estimate item-item
similarities. Our experiments provide preliminary results indicating the
effectiveness of whitening low-dimensional item embeddings.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant popularity in recommendation
systems as it enables the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. A
key challenge in MTL is the occurrence of negative transfer, where the
performance of certain tasks deteriorates due to conflicts between tasks.
Existing research has explored negative transfer by treating all samples as a
whole, overlooking the inherent complexities within them. To this end, we delve
into the intricacies of samples by splitting them based on the relative amount
of positive feedback among tasks. Surprisingly, negative transfer still occurs
in existing MTL methods on samples that receive comparable feedback across
tasks. It is worth noting that existing methods commonly employ a
shared-embedding paradigm, and we hypothesize that their failure can be
attributed to the limited capacity of modeling diverse user preferences across
tasks using such universal embeddings.
<br />In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm called Shared and Task-specific
EMbeddings (STEM) that aims to incorporate both shared and task-specific
embeddings to effectively capture task-specific user preferences. Under this
paradigm, we propose a simple model STEM-Net, which is equipped with shared and
task-specific embedding tables, along with a customized gating network with
stop-gradient operations to facilitate the learning of these embeddings.
Remarkably, STEM-Net demonstrates exceptional performance on comparable
samples, surpassing the Single-Task Like model and achieves positive transfer.
Comprehensive evaluation on three public MTL recommendation datasets
demonstrates that STEM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models by a substantial
margin, providing evidence of its effectiveness and superiority.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a system used to generate game feature suggestions
based on a text prompt. Trained on the game descriptions of almost 60k games,
it uses the word embeddings of a small GLoVe model to extract features and
entities found in thematically similar games which are then passed through a
generator model to generate new features for a user's prompt. We perform a
short user study comparing the features generated from a fine-tuned GPT-2
model, a model using the ConceptNet, and human-authored game features. Although
human suggestions won the overall majority of votes, the GPT-2 model
outperformed the human suggestions in certain games. This system is part of a
larger game design assistant tool that is able to collaborate with users at a
conceptual level.

<p class="mathjax">This paper delves into the evolving relationship between humans and computers
in the realm of programming. Historically, programming has been a dialogue
where humans meticulously crafted communication to suit machine understanding,
shaping the trajectory of computer science education. However, the advent of
AI-based no-code platforms is revolutionizing this dynamic. Now, humans can
converse in their natural language, expecting machines to interpret and act.
This shift has profound implications for computer science education. As
educators, it's imperative to integrate this new dynamic into curricula. In
this paper, we've explored several pertinent research questions in this
transformation, which demand continued inquiry and adaptation in our
educational strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Labels are widely used in augmented reality (AR) to display digital
information. Ensuring the readability of AR labels requires placing them
occlusion-free while keeping visual linkings legible, especially when multiple
labels exist in the scene. Although existing optimization-based methods, such
as force-based methods, are effective in managing AR labels in static
scenarios, they often struggle in dynamic scenarios with constantly moving
objects. This is due to their focus on generating layouts optimal for the
current moment, neglecting future moments and leading to sub-optimal or
unstable layouts over time. In this work, we present RL-LABEL, a deep
reinforcement learning-based method for managing the placement of AR labels in
scenarios involving moving objects. RL-LABEL considers the current and
predicted future states of objects and labels, such as positions and
velocities, as well as the user's viewpoint, to make informed decisions about
label placement. It balances the trade-offs between immediate and long-term
objectives. Our experiments on two real-world datasets show that RL-LABEL
effectively learns the decision-making process for long-term optimization,
outperforming two baselines (i.e., no view management and a force-based method)
by minimizing label occlusions, line intersections, and label movement
distance. Additionally, a user study involving 18 participants indicates that
RL-LABEL excels over the baselines in aiding users to identify, compare, and
summarize data on AR labels within dynamic scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been successfully used to help users
discover the items of interest. Nevertheless, existing CF methods suffer from
noisy data issue, which negatively impacts the quality of recommendation. To
tackle this problem, many prior studies leverage adversarial learning to
regularize the representations of users/items, which improves both
generalizability and robustness. Those methods often learn adversarial
perturbations and model parameters under min-max optimization framework.
However, there still have two major drawbacks: 1) Existing methods lack
theoretical guarantees of why adding perturbations improve the model
generalizability and robustness; 2) Solving min-max optimization is
time-consuming. In addition to updating the model parameters, each iteration
requires additional computations to update the perturbations, making them not
scalable for industry-scale datasets.
<br />In this paper, we present Sharpness-aware Collaborative Filtering (SharpCF),
a simple yet effective method that conducts adversarial training without extra
computational cost over the base optimizer. To achieve this goal, we first
revisit the existing adversarial collaborative filtering and discuss its
connection with recent Sharpness-aware Minimization. This analysis shows that
adversarial training actually seeks model parameters that lie in neighborhoods
around the optimal model parameters having uniformly low loss values, resulting
in better generalizability. To reduce the computational overhead, SharpCF
introduces a novel trajectory loss to measure the alignment between current
weights and past weights. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate that our SharpCF achieves superior performance with almost zero
additional computational cost comparing to adversarial training.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their impressive
ability to provide context-aware responses via text. This ability could
potentially be used to predict plausible solutions in sequential decision
making tasks pertaining to pattern completion. For example, by observing a
partial stack of cubes, LLMs can predict the correct sequence in which the
remaining cubes should be stacked by extrapolating the observed patterns (e.g.,
cube sizes, colors or other attributes) in the partial stack. In this work, we
introduce LaGR (Language-Guided Reinforcement learning), which uses this
predictive ability of LLMs to propose solutions to tasks that have been
partially completed by a primary reinforcement learning (RL) agent, in order to
subsequently guide the latter's training. However, as RL training is generally
not sample-efficient, deploying this approach would inherently imply that the
LLM be repeatedly queried for solutions; a process that can be expensive and
infeasible. To address this issue, we introduce SEQ (sample efficient
querying), where we simultaneously train a secondary RL agent to decide when
the LLM should be queried for solutions. Specifically, we use the quality of
the solutions emanating from the LLM as the reward to train this agent. We show
that our proposed framework LaGR-SEQ enables more efficient primary RL
training, while simultaneously minimizing the number of queries to the LLM. We
demonstrate our approach on a series of tasks and highlight the advantages of
our approach, along with its limitations and potential future research
directions.

<p class="mathjax">The development of ubiquitous computing and sensing devices has brought about
novel interaction scenarios such as mixed reality and IoT (e.g., smart home),
which pose new demands for the next generation of natural user interfaces
(NUI). Human hand, benefit for the large degree-of-freedom, serves as a medium
through which people interact with the external world in their daily lives,
thus also being regarded as the main entry of NUI. Unfortunately, current hand
tracking system is largely confined on first perspective vision-based
solutions, which suffer from optical artifacts and are not practical in
ubiquitous environments. In my thesis, I rethink this problem by analyzing the
underlying logic in terms of sensor, behavior, and semantics, constituting a
research framework for achieving ubiquitous intelligent hand interaction. Then
I summarize my previous research topics and illustrated the future research
directions based on my research framework.

<p class="mathjax">Abstract. While the use of location-based augmented reality (AR) for
education has demonstrated benefits on participants' motivation, engagement,
and on their physical activity, geolocation data inaccuracy causes augmented
objects to jitter or drift, which is a factor in downgrading user experience.
We developed a free and open source web AR application and conducted a
comparative user test (n = 54) in order to assess the impact of geolocation
data on usability, exploration, and focus. A control group explored
biodiversity in nature using the system in combination with embedded GNSS data,
and an experimental group used an external module for RTK data. During the
test, eye tracking data, geolocated traces, and in-app user-triggered events
were recorded. Participants answered usability questionnaires (SUS, UEQ,
HARUS).We found that the geolocation data the RTK group was exposed to was less
accurate in average than that of the control group. The RTK group reported
lower usability scores on all scales, of which 5 out of 9 were significant,
indicating that inaccurate data negatively predicts usability. The GNSS group
walked more than the RTK group, indicating a partial effect on exploration. We
found no significant effect on interaction time with the screen, indicating no
specific relation between data accuracy and focus. While RTK data did not allow
us to better the usability of location-based AR interfaces, results allow us to
assess our system's overall usability as excellent, and to define optimal
operating conditions for future use with pupils.

<p class="mathjax">The selection of features for text classification is a fundamental task in
text mining and information retrieval. Despite being the sixth most widely
spoken language in the world, Bangla has received little attention due to the
scarcity of text datasets. In this research, we collected, annotated, and
prepared a comprehensive dataset of 212,184 Bangla documents in seven different
categories and made it publicly accessible. We implemented three deep learning
generative models: LSTM variational autoencoder (LSTM VAE), auxiliary
classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN), and adversarial autoencoder
(AAE) to extract text features, although their applications are initially found
in the field of computer vision. We utilized our dataset to train these three
models and used the feature space obtained in the document classification task.
We evaluated the performance of the classifiers and found that the adversarial
autoencoder model produced the best feature space.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Infinitia, a simulation game system that uses generative image
and language models at play time to reshape all aspects of the setting and NPCs
based on a short description from the player, in a way similar to how settings
are created on the fictional Holodeck. Building off the ideas of the Generative
Agents paper, our system introduces gameplay elements, such as infinite
generated fantasy worlds, controllability of NPC behavior, humorous dialogue,
cost &amp; time efficiency, collaboration between players and elements of
non-determinism among in-game events. Infinitia is implemented in the Unity
engine with a server-client architecture, facilitating the addition of exciting
features by community developers in the future. Furthermore, it uses a
multiplayer framework to allow humans to be present and interact in the
simulation. The simulation will be available in open-alpha shortly at
https://infinitia.ai/ and we are looking forward to building upon it with the
community.

<p class="mathjax">Asynchronous online discussions are a common fundamental tool to facilitate
social interaction in hybrid and online courses. However, instructors lack the
tools to accomplish the overwhelming task of evaluating asynchronous online
discussion activities. In this paper we present an approach that uses Latent
Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) and the instructor's keywords to automatically extract
codes from a relatively small dataset. We use the generated codes to build an
Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) model and compare this model with a previous
ENA model built by human coders. The results show that there is no statistical
difference between the two models. We present an analysis of these models and
discuss the potential use of ENA as a visualization to help instructors
evaluating asynchronous online discussions.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce ChatSQC, an innovative chatbot system that combines the power of
OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLM) with a specific knowledge base in
Statistical Quality Control (SQC). Our research focuses on enhancing LLMs using
specific SQC references, shedding light on how data preprocessing parameters
and LLM selection impact the quality of generated responses. By illustrating
this process, we hope to motivate wider community engagement to refine LLM
design and output appraisal techniques. We also highlight potential research
opportunities within the SQC domain that can be facilitated by leveraging
ChatSQC, thereby broadening the application spectrum of SQC. A primary goal of
our work is to equip practitioners with a tool capable of generating precise
SQC-related responses, thereby democratizing access to advanced SQC knowledge.
To continuously improve ChatSQC, we ask the SQC community to provide feedback,
highlight potential issues, request additional features, and/or contribute via
pull requests through our public GitHub repository. Additionally, the team will
continue to explore adding supplementary reference material that would further
improve the contextual understanding of the chatbot. Overall, ChatSQC serves as
a testament to the transformative potential of AI within SQC, and we hope it

<p class="mathjax">Recently, digital humans for interpersonal interaction in virtual
environments have gained significant attention. In this paper, we introduce a
novel multi-dancer synthesis task called partner dancer generation, which
involves synthesizing virtual human dancers capable of performing dance with
users. The task aims to control the pose diversity between the lead dancer and
the partner dancer. The core of this task is to ensure the controllable
diversity of the generated partner dancer while maintaining temporal
coordination with the lead dancer. This scenario varies from earlier research
in generating dance motions driven by music, as our emphasis is on
automatically designing partner dancer postures according to pre-defined
diversity, the pose of lead dancer, as well as the accompanying tunes. To
achieve this objective, we propose a three-stage framework called
Dance-with-You (DanY). Initially, we employ a 3D Pose Collection stage to
collect a wide range of basic dance poses as references for motion generation.
Then, we introduce a hyper-parameter that coordinates the similarity between
dancers by masking poses to prevent the generation of sequences that are
over-diverse or consistent. To avoid the rigidity of movements, we design a
Dance Pre-generated stage to pre-generate these masked poses instead of filling
them with zeros. After that, a Dance Motion Transfer stage is adopted with
leader sequences and music, in which a multi-conditional sampling formula is
rewritten to transfer the pre-generated poses into a sequence with a partner
style. In practice, to address the lack of multi-person datasets, we introduce
AIST-M, a new dataset for partner dancer generation, which is publicly
availiable. Comprehensive evaluations on our AIST-M dataset demonstrate that
the proposed DanY can synthesize satisfactory partner dancer results with
controllable diversity.

<p class="mathjax">Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently become a popular data
augmentation technique used by machine learning practitioners. However, they
have been shown to suffer from the so-called mode collapse failure mode, which
makes them vulnerable to exacerbating biases on already skewed datasets,
resulting in the generated data distribution being less diverse than the
training distribution. To this end, we address the problem of quantifying the
extent to which mode collapse occurs. This study is a systematic effort focused
on the evaluation of state-of-the-art metrics that can potentially quantify
biases in GAN-augmented data. We show that, while several such methods are
available, there is no single metric that quantifies bias exacerbation reliably
over the span of different image domains.

<p class="mathjax">Computer Vision (CV) is playing a significant role in transforming society by
utilizing machine learning (ML) tools for a wide range of tasks. However, the
need for large-scale datasets to train ML models creates challenges for
centralized ML algorithms. The massive computation loads required for
processing and the potential privacy risks associated with storing and
processing data on central cloud servers put these algorithms under severe
strain. To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
promising solution, allowing privacy preservation by training models locally
and exchanging them to improve overall performance. Additionally, the
computational load is distributed across multiple clients, reducing the burden
on central servers. This paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge,
the first review discussing recent advancements of FL in CV applications,
comparing them to conventional centralized training paradigms. It provides an
overview of current FL applications in various CV tasks, emphasizing the
advantages of FL and the challenges of implementing it in CV. To facilitate
this, the paper proposes a taxonomy of FL techniques in CV, outlining their
applications and security threats. It also discusses privacy concerns related
to implementing blockchain in FL schemes for CV tasks and summarizes existing
privacy preservation methods. Moving on, the paper identifies open research
challenges and potential future research directions to further exploit the
potential of FL and blockchain in CV applications.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models play a vital role in making predictions and deriving
insights from data and are being increasingly used for causal inference. To
preserve user privacy, it is important to enable the model to forget some of
its learning/captured information about a given user (machine unlearning). This
paper introduces the concept of machine unlearning for causal inference,
particularly propensity score matching and treatment effect estimation, which
aims to refine and improve the performance of machine learning models for
causal analysis given the above unlearning requirements. The paper presents a
methodology for machine unlearning using a neural network-based propensity
score model. The dataset used in the study is the Lalonde dataset, a widely
used dataset for evaluating the effectiveness i.e. the treatment effect of job
training programs. The methodology involves training an initial propensity
score model on the original dataset and then creating forget sets by
selectively removing instances, as well as matched instance pairs. based on
propensity score matching. These forget sets are used to evaluate the retrained
model, allowing for the elimination of unwanted associations. The actual
retraining of the model is performed using the retain set. The experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the machine unlearning approach. The
distribution and histogram analysis of propensity scores before and after
unlearning provide insights into the impact of the unlearning process on the
data. This study represents the first attempt to apply machine unlearning
techniques to causal inference.

business if the relevant data can be located. Often the data is in a data lake
without a consistent schema, making locating useful data challenging. Table
search is a growing research area, but existing benchmarks have been limited to
displayed tables. Tables sized and formatted for display in a Wikipedia page or
ArXiv paper are considerably different from data tables in both scale and
style. By using metadata associated with open data from government portals, we
create the first dataset to benchmark search over data tables at scale. We
demonstrate three styles of table-to-table related table search. The three
notions of table relatedness are: tables produced by the same organization,
tables distributed as part of the same dataset, and tables with a high degree
of overlap in the annotated tags. The keyword tags provided with the metadata
also permit the automatic creation of a keyword search over tables benchmark.
We provide baselines on this dataset using existing methods including
traditional and neural approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In traffic safety research, extracting information from crash narratives
using text analysis is a common practice. With recent advancements of large
language models (LLM), it would be useful to know how the popular LLM
interfaces perform in classifying or extracting information from crash
narratives. To explore this, our study has used the three most popular publicly
available LLM interfaces- ChatGPT, BARD and GPT4. This study investigated their
usefulness and boundaries in extracting information and answering queries
related to accidents from 100 crash narratives from Iowa and Kansas. During the
investigation, their capabilities and limitations were assessed and their
responses to the queries were compared. Five questions were asked related to
the narratives: 1) Who is at-fault? 2) What is the manner of collision? 3) Has
the crash occurred in a work-zone? 4) Did the crash involve pedestrians? and 5)
What are the sequence of harmful events in the crash? For questions 1 through
4, the overall similarity among the LLMs were 70%, 35%, 96% and 89%,
respectively. The similarities were higher while answering direct questions
requiring binary responses and significantly lower for complex questions. To
compare the responses to question 5, network diagram and centrality measures
were analyzed. The network diagram from the three LLMs were not always similar
although they sometimes have the same influencing events with high in-degree,
out-degree and betweenness centrality. This study suggests using multiple
models to extract viable information from narratives. Also, caution must be
practiced while using these interfaces to obtain crucial safety related
information.

<p class="mathjax">Emerging tools bring forth fresh approaches to work, and the field of natural
science is no different. In natural science, traditional manual, serial, and
labour-intensive work is being augmented by automated, parallel, and iterative
processes driven by artificial intelligence-based experimental automation and
more. To add new capabilities in natural science, enabling the acceleration and
enrichment of automation of the discovery process, we present DARWIN, a series
of tailored LLMs for natural science, mainly in physics, chemistry, and
material science. This series relies on open-source LLM, incorporating
structured and unstructured scientific knowledge from public datasets and
literature. We fine-tuned the models using over 60,000 instruction data points,
emphasizing factual correctness. During the fine-tuning, we introduce the
Scientific Instruction Generation (SIG) model, automating instruction
generation from scientific texts. This eliminates the need for manual
extraction or domain-specific knowledge graphs and efficiently injects
scientific knowledge into the model. We also explore multi-task training
strategies, revealing interconnections between scientific tasks. DARWIN series
not only achieves state-of-the-art results on various scientific tasks but also
diminishes reliance on closed-source AI models. Our research showcases the
ability of LLM in the scientific domain, with the overarching goal of fostering
prosperity within the broader AI for science community.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the great advance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in both
instruction dataset building and benchmarking, the independence of training and
evaluation makes current MLLMs hard to further improve their capability under
the guidance of evaluation results with a relatively low human cost. In this
paper, we propose MLLM-DataEngine, a novel closed-loop system that bridges data
generation, model training, and evaluation. Within each loop iteration, the
MLLM-DataEngine first analyze the weakness of the model based on the evaluation
results, then generate a proper incremental dataset for the next training
iteration and enhance the model capability iteratively. Compared with previous
data collection methods which are separate from the benchmarking, the data
generated by MLLM-DataEngine shows better targeting, quality, and correctness.
For targeting, we propose an Adaptive Bad-case Sampling module, which adjusts
the ratio of different types of data within each incremental dataset based on
the benchmarking results. For quality, we resort to GPT-4 to generate
high-quality data with each given data type. For correctness, prompt design is
critical for the data generation results. Rather than previous hand-crafted
prompt, we propose an Interactive Prompt Optimization strategy, which optimizes
the prompt with the multi-round interaction between human and GPT, and improve
the correctness of generated data greatly. Through extensive experiments, we
find our MLLM-DataEngine could boost the MLLM capability in a targeted and
automatic manner, with only a few human participation. The MLLM-DataEngine will
be released and we hope it could be a general solution for the following MLLMs
building.

<p class="mathjax">Mental health significantly influences various aspects of our daily lives,
and its importance has been increasingly recognized by the research community
and the general public, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This
heightened interest is evident in the growing number of publications dedicated
to mental health in the past decade. In this study, our goal is to identify
general trends in the field and pinpoint high-impact research topics by
analyzing a large dataset of mental health research papers. To accomplish this,
we collected abstracts from various databases and trained a customized
Sentence-BERT based embedding model leveraging the BERTopic framework. Our
dataset comprises 96,676 research papers pertaining to mental health, enabling
us to examine the relationships between different topics using their abstracts.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, we compared it against two other
state-of-the-art methods: Top2Vec model and LDA-BERT model. The model
demonstrated superior performance in metrics that measure topic diversity and
coherence. To enhance our analysis, we also generated word clouds to provide a
comprehensive overview of the machine learning models applied in mental health
research, shedding light on commonly utilized techniques and emerging trends.
Furthermore, we provide a GitHub link* to the dataset used in this paper,
ensuring its accessibility for further research endeavors.

<p class="mathjax">Real-time predictive modelling with desired accuracy is highly expected in
industrial artificial intelligence (IAI), where neural networks play a key
role. Neural networks in IAI require powerful, high-performance computing
devices to operate a large number of floating point data. Based on stochastic
configuration networks (SCNs), this paper proposes a new randomized learner
model, termed stochastic configuration machines (SCMs), to stress effective
modelling and data size saving that are useful and valuable for industrial
applications. Compared to SCNs and random vector functional-link (RVFL) nets
with binarized implementation, the model storage of SCMs can be significantly
compressed while retaining favourable prediction performance. Besides the
architecture of the SCM learner model and its learning algorithm, as an
important part of this contribution, we also provide a theoretical basis on the
learning capacity of SCMs by analysing the model's complexity. Experimental
studies are carried out over some benchmark datasets and three industrial
applications. The results demonstrate that SCM has great potential for dealing
with industrial data analytics.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of this work is to understand the retraction phenomenon in the arts
and humanities domain through an analysis of the retraction notices: formal
documents stating and describing the retraction of a particular publication.
The retractions and the corresponding notices are identified using the data
provided by Retraction Watch. Our methodology for the analysis combines a
metadata analysis and a content analysis (mainly performed using a topic
modeling process) of the retraction notices. Considering 343 cases of
retraction, we found that many retraction notices are neither identifiable nor
findable. In addition, these were not always separated from the original
papers, introducing ambiguity in understanding how these notices were perceived
by the community (i.e., cited). Also, we noticed that there is no systematic
way to write a retraction notice. Indeed, some retraction notices presented a
complete discussion of the reasons for retraction, while others tended to be
more direct and succinct. We have also reported many notices having similar
text while addressing different retractions. We think a further study with a
larger collection should be done using the same methodology to confirm and
investigate our findings further.

<p class="mathjax">Completing a sentence, phrase or word after typing few words / characters is
very helpful for Intuit financial experts, while taking notes or having a live
chat with users, since they need to write complex financial concepts more
efficiently and accurately many times in a day. In this paper, we tie together
different approaches like large language models, traditional Markov Models and
char level models to create an end-to-end system to provide personalised
sentence/word auto-complete suggestions to experts, under strict latency
constraints. Proposed system can auto-complete sentences, phrases or words
while writing with personalisation and can be trained with very less data and
resources with good efficiency. Our proposed system is not only efficient and
personalized but also robust as it leverages multiple machine learning
techniques along with transfer learning approach to fine tune large language
model with Intuit specific data. This ensures that even in cases of rare or
unusual phrases, the system can provide relevant auto-complete suggestions in
near real time. Survey has showed that this system saves expert note-taking
time and boosts expert confidence in their communication with teammates and
clients. Since enabling this predictive writing feature for QBLive experts,
more than a million keystrokes have been saved based on these suggestions. We
have done comparative study for our ensemble choice. Moreover this feature can
be integrated with any product which has writing facility within a very short
period of time.

<p class="mathjax">Text Style Transfer (TST) is challenging to evaluate because the quality of
the generated text manifests itself in multiple aspects, each of which is hard
to measure individually: style transfer accuracy, content preservation, and
overall fluency of the text. Human evaluation is the gold standard in TST
evaluation; however, it is expensive, and the results are difficult to
reproduce. Numerous automated metrics are employed to assess performance in
these aspects, serving as substitutes for human evaluation. However, the
correlation between many of these automated metrics and human evaluations
remains unclear, raising doubts about their effectiveness as reliable
benchmarks. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their ability to not only match but also surpass the average human
performance across a wide range of unseen tasks. This suggests that LLMs have
the potential to serve as a viable alternative to human evaluation and other
automated metrics. We assess the performance of different LLMs on TST
evaluation by employing multiple input prompts and comparing their results. Our
findings indicate that (even zero-shot) prompting correlates strongly with
human evaluation and often surpasses the performance of (other) automated
metrics. Additionally, we propose the ensembling of prompts and show it
increases the robustness of TST evaluation.This work contributes to the ongoing
efforts in evaluating LLMs on diverse tasks, which includes a discussion of
failure cases and limitations.

<p class="mathjax">Building defect prediction models based on online learning can enhance
prediction accuracy. It continuously rebuilds a new prediction model when
adding a new data point. However, predicting a module as "non-defective" (i.e.,
negative prediction) can result in fewer test cases for such modules.
Therefore, defects can be overlooked during testing, even when the module is
defective. The erroneous test results are used as learning data by online
learning, which could negatively affect prediction accuracy. In our experiment,
we demonstrate this negative influence on prediction accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In the wake of the arrival of digital media, the Internet, the web, and
online social media, a flood of new cyber security research questions have
emerged. There is a lot of money being lost around the world because of
cyber-attacks. As a result, cyber security has emerged as one of the world's
most complex and pressing issues. Cyber security experts from both industry and
academia institutions are now analyzing current cyber-attacks occurring around
the world and developing various strategies to defend systems from possible
cyber-threats and attacks. This paper examines recent cyber security attacks as
well as the financial losses incurred as a result of the growing number of
cyber-attacks. Our findings indicate that the majority of the research chosen
for this study focused solely on a small number of widespread security flaws,
such as malware, phishing, and denial-of-service attacks. A total of over 50
major studies that have been published in reputable academic journals and
conferences have been chosen for additional examination. A taxonomy of
cyber-attacks elements that is based on the context of use in various
environments has also been suggested, in addition to a review of the most
recent studies on countermeasures for cyber-attacks being the state of the art.
Lastly, the research gaps in terms of open issues have been described in order
to offer potential future directions for the researchers working in the field
of cyber security.

<p class="mathjax">Geographic regression models of various descriptions are often applied to
identify patterns and anomalies in the determinants of spatially distributed
observations. These types of analyses focus on answering why questions about
underlying spatial phenomena, e.g., why is crime higher in this locale, why do
children in one school district outperform those in another, etc.? Answers to
these questions require explanations of the model structure, the choice of
parameters, and contextualization of the findings with respect to their
geographic context. This is particularly true for local forms of regression
models which are focused on the role of locational context in determining human
behavior. In this paper, we present GeoExplainer, a visual analytics framework
designed to support analysts in creating explanative documentation that
summarizes and contextualizes their spatial analyses. As analysts create their
spatial models, our framework flags potential issues with model parameter
selections, utilizes template-based text generation to summarize model outputs,
and links with external knowledge repositories to provide annotations that help
to explain the model results. As analysts explore the model results, all
visualizations and annotations can be captured in an interactive report
generation widget. We demonstrate our framework using a case study modeling the
determinants of voting in the 2016 US Presidential Election.

<p class="mathjax">The security trade confidentiality, integrity and availability are the main
pillar of the information systems as every organization emphasize of the
security. From last few decades, digital data is the main asset for every
digital or non-digital organization. The proliferation of easily accessible
attack software on the internet has lowered the barrier for individuals without
hacking skills to engage in malicious activities. An Industrial organization
operates a server that (Confluence) serves as a learning platform for newly
hired employees or Management training officers, thereby making it vulnerable
to potential attacks using readily available internet-based software. To
mitigate this risk, it is essential to implement a security system capable of
detecting and preventing attacks, as well as conducting investigations. This
research project aims to develop a comprehensive security system that can
detect attack attempts, initiate preventive measures, and carry out
investigations by analyzing attack logs. The study adopted a survey methodology
and spanned a period of four months, from March 1, 2023, to June 31, 2023. The
outcome of this research is a robust security system that effectively
identifies attack attempts, blocks the attacker's IP address, and employs
network forensic techniques for investigation purposes. The findings indicate
that deploying Snort in IPS mode on PfSense enables the detection of attacks
targeting e-learning servers, triggering automatic preventive measures such as
IP address blocking. The alerts generated by Snort facilitate investigative
actions through network forensics, allowing for accurate reporting on the
detrimental effects of the attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Sentiment analysis is the task of mining the authors' opinions about specific
entities. It allows organizations to monitor different services in real time
and act accordingly. Reputation is what is generally said or believed about
people or things. Informally, reputation combines the measure of reliability
derived from feedback, reviews, and ratings gathered from users, which reflect
their quality of experience (QoE) and can either increase or harm the
reputation of the provided services. In this study, we propose to perform
sentiment analysis on web microservices reviews to exploit the provided
information to assess and score the microservices' reputation. Our proposed
approach uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to perform sentiment
analysis and the Net Brand Reputation (NBR) algorithm to assess reputation
scores for microservices. This approach is tested on a set of more than 10,000
reviews related to 15 Amazon Web microservices, and the experimental results
have shown that our approach is more accurate than existing approaches, with an
accuracy and precision of 93% obtained after applying an oversampling strategy
and a resulting reputation score of the considered microservices community of
89%.

<p class="mathjax">This book chapter delves into the pressing need to "queer" the ethics of AI
to challenge and re-evaluate the normative suppositions and values that
underlie AI systems. The chapter emphasizes the ethical concerns surrounding
the potential for AI to perpetuate discrimination, including binarism, and
amplify existing inequalities due to the lack of representative datasets and
the affordances and constraints depending on technology readiness. The chapter
argues that a critical examination of the neoliberal conception of equality
that often underpins non-discrimination law is necessary and cannot stress more
the need to create alternative interdisciplinary approaches that consider the
complex and intersecting factors that shape individuals' experiences of
discrimination. By exploring such approaches centering on intersectionality and
vulnerability-informed design, the chapter contends that designers and
developers can create more ethical AI systems that are inclusive, equitable,
and responsive to the needs and experiences of all individuals and communities,
particularly those who are most vulnerable to discrimination and harm.

divisor constraints of the form $\gcd(f,g) \sim d$, where $f$ and $g$ are
linear polynomials, $d$ is a positive integer, and $\sim$ is a relation among
$\leq, =, \neq$ and $\geq$. We show that the feasibility problem for these
systems is in NP, and that an optimal solution minimizing a linear objective
function, if it exists, has polynomial bit length. To show these results, we
identify an expressive fragment of the existential theory of the integers with
addition and divisibility that admits solutions of polynomial bit length. It
was shown by Lipshitz [Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 235, pp. 271-283, 1978] that this
theory adheres to a local-to-global principle in the following sense: a formula
$\Phi$ is equi-satisfiable with a formula $\Psi$ in this theory such that
$\Psi$ has a solution if and only if $\Psi$ has a solution modulo every prime
$p$. We show that in our fragment, only a polynomial number of primes of
polynomial bit length need to be considered, and that the solutions modulo
prime numbers can be combined to yield a solution to $\Phi$ of polynomial bit
length. As a technical by-product, we establish a Chinese-remainder-type
theorem for systems of congruences and non-congruences showing that solution
sizes do not depend on the magnitude of the moduli of non-congruences.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, images are considered samples from a high-dimensional distribution,
and deep learning has become almost synonymous with image generation. However,
is a deep learning network truly necessary for image generation? In this paper,
we investigate the possibility of image generation without using a deep
learning network, motivated by validating the assumption that images follow a
high-dimensional distribution. Since images are assumed to be samples from such
a distribution, we utilize the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to describe it. In
particular, we employ a recent distribution learning technique named as
Monte-Carlo Marginalization to capture the parameters of the GMM based on image
samples. Moreover, we also use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for
dimensionality reduction to decrease computational complexity. During our
evaluation experiment, we first attempt to model the distribution of image
samples directly to verify the assumption that images truly follow a
distribution. We then use the SVD for dimensionality reduction. The principal
components, rather than raw image data, are used for distribution learning.
Compared to methods relying on deep learning networks, our approach is more
explainable, and its performance is promising. Experiments show that our images
have a lower FID value compared to those generated by variational
auto-encoders, demonstrating the feasibility of image generation without deep
learning networks.

adaptive mesh refinement. In p4est primitives are stored as octants in three
and quadrants in two dimensions. While, classically, they are encoded by the
native approach using its spatial and refinement level, any other
mathematically equivalent encoding might be used instead.
<br />Recognizing this, we add two alternative representations to the classical,
explicit version, based on a long monotonic index and 128-bit AVX quad
integers, respectively. The first one requires changes in logic for low-level
quadrant manipulating algorithms, while the other exploits data level
parallelism and requires algorithms to be adapted to SIMD instructions. The
resultant algorithms and data structures lead to higher performance and lesser
memory usage in comparison with the standard baseline.
<br />We benchmark selected algorithms on a cluster with two Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold
6130 Skylake family CPUs per node, which provides support for AVX2 extensions,
192 GB RAM per node, and up to 512 computational cores in total.

<p class="mathjax">In modern communication systems operating with Orthogonal Frequency-Division
Multiplexing (OFDM), channel estimation requires minimal complexity with
one-tap equalizers. However, this depends on cyclic prefixes, which must be
sufficiently large to cover the channel impulse response. Conversely, the use
of cyclic prefix (CP) decreases the useful information that can be conveyed in
an OFDM frame, thereby degrading the spectral efficiency of the system. In this
context, we study the impact of CPs on channel estimation with complex-valued
neural networks (CVNNs). We show that the phase-transmittance radial basis
function neural network offers superior results, in terms of required energy
per bit, compared to classical minimum mean-squared error and least squares
algorithms in scenarios without CP.

<p class="mathjax">Bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) charging is a technology that is gaining
rapid popularity due to its ability to provide economic and environmental
benefits to both EV owners and power system operators (PSOs). Using the EV as a
flexible source of energy, an EV owner can provide power to homes/buildings, or
even participate in grid services such as demand response and frequency
regulation. However, there is a lack of real-world testing and validation for
bidirectional charging technology, particularly in the residential segment. As
such, this paper presents real-world field testing of a bidirectional EV
charger deployed in a home. Control software is developed to dispatch the EV
according to static setpoints, as well as automated load following, and its
accuracy and responsiveness is reported on. The results of the testing with the
charger and 2019 Nissan Leaf combination indicates a responsiveness of 6-8
seconds and accuracy of over 99%, which suggests feasible participation for
applications such as load following, arbitrage, and demand response.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse generalized matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental
operation for real-world network analysis. With the increasing size of
real-world networks, the single-machine-based SpGEMM approach cannot perform
SpGEMM on large-scale networks, exceeding the size of main memory (i.e., not
scalable). Although the distributed-system-based approach could handle
large-scale SpGEMM based on multiple machines, it suffers from severe
inter-machine communication overhead to aggregate results of multiple machines
(i.e., not efficient). To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a
novel storage-based SpGEMM approach (SAGE) that stores given networks in
storage (e.g., SSD) and loads only the necessary parts of the networks into
main memory when they are required for processing via a 3-layer architecture.
Furthermore, we point out three challenges that could degrade the overall
performance of SAGE and propose three effective strategies to address them: (1)
block-based workload allocation for balancing workloads across threads, (2)
in-memory partial aggregation for reducing the amount of unnecessarily
generated storage-memory I/Os, and (3) distribution-aware memory allocation for
preventing unexpected buffer overflows in main memory. Via extensive
evaluation, we verify the superiority of SAGE over existing SpGEMM methods in
terms of scalability and efficiency.

render-and-compare in the learning-based framework from a single image, capable
of generating visually plausible and accurate 3D hand meshes while recovering
realistic textures. Our method achieves superior texture reconstruction by
employing a parametric hand model with predefined texture assets, and by
establishing a texture reconstruction consistency between the rendered and
input images during training. Moreover, based on pretraining the network on an
annotated dataset, we apply varying degrees of supervision using our pipeline,
i.e., self-supervision, weak supervision, and full supervision, and discuss the
various levels of contributions of the learned high-fidelity textures in
enhancing hand pose and shape estimation. Experimental results on public
benchmarks including FreiHAND and HO-3D demonstrate that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art hand reconstruction methods in texture reconstruction
quality while maintaining comparable accuracy in pose and shape estimation. Our

<p class="mathjax">Membership (membership query / membership testing) is a fundamental problem
across databases, networks and security. However, previous research has
primarily focused on either approximate solutions, such as Bloom Filters, or
exact methods, like perfect hashing and dictionaries, without attempting to
develop a an integral theory. In this paper, we propose a unified and complete
theory, namely chain rule, for general membership problems, which encompasses
both approximate and exact membership as extreme cases. Building upon the chain
rule, we introduce a straightforward yet versatile algorithm framework, namely
ChainedFilter, to combine different elementary filters without losing
information. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ChainedFilter performs
well in many applications: (1) it requires only 26% additional space over the
theoretical lower bound for implicit static dictionary, (2) it requires only
0.22 additional bit per item over the theoretical lower bound for lossless data
compression, (3) it reduces up to 31% external memory access than raw Cuckoo
Hashing, (4) it reduces up to 36% P99 tail point query latency than Bloom
Filter under the same space cost in RocksDB database, and (5) it reduces up to
99.1% filter space than original Learned Bloom Filter.

<p class="mathjax">The scale and complexity of workloads in modern cloud services have brought
into sharper focus a critical challenge in automated index tuning -- the need
to recommend high-quality indexes while maintaining index tuning scalability.
This challenge is further compounded by the requirement for automated index
implementations to introduce minimal query performance regressions in
production deployments, representing a significant barrier to achieving
scalability and full automation. This paper directs attention to these
challenges within automated index tuning and explores ways in which machine
learning (ML) techniques provide new opportunities in their mitigation. In
particular, we reflect on recent efforts in developing ML techniques for
workload selection, candidate index filtering, speeding up index configuration
search, reducing the amount of query optimizer calls, and lowering the chances
of performance regressions. We highlight the key takeaways from these efforts
and underline the gaps that need to be closed for their effective functioning
within the traditional index tuning framework. Additionally, we present a
preliminary cross-platform design aimed at democratizing index tuning across
multiple SQL-like systems -- an imperative in today's continuously expanding
data system landscape. We believe our findings will help provide context and
impetus to the research and development efforts in automated index tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling attacks, in which an adversary uses machine learning techniques to
model a hardware-based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) pose a great threat
to the viability of these hardware security primitives. In most modeling
attacks, a random subset of challenge-response-pairs (CRPs) are used as the
labeled data for the machine learning algorithm. Here, for the arbiter-PUF, a
delay based PUF which may be viewed as a linear threshold function with random
weights (due to manufacturing imperfections), we investigate the role of active
learning in Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. We focus on challenge
selection to help SVM algorithm learn ``fast'' and learn ``slow''. Our methods
construct challenges rather than relying on a sample pool of challenges as in
prior work. Using active learning to learn ``fast'' (less CRPs revealed, higher
accuracies) may help manufacturers learn the manufactured PUFs more
efficiently, or may form a more powerful attack when the attacker may query the
PUF for CRPs at will. Using active learning to select challenges from which
learning is ``slow'' (low accuracy despite a large number of revealed CRPs) may
provide a basis for slowing down attackers who are limited to overhearing CRPs.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning (CL) in deep neural networks (DNNs) involves incrementally
accumulating knowledge in a DNN from a growing data stream. A major challenge
in CL is that non-stationary data streams cause catastrophic forgetting of
previously learned abilities. Rehearsal is a popular and effective way to
mitigate this problem, which is storing past observations in a buffer and
mixing them with new observations during learning. This leads to a question:
Which stored samples should be selected for rehearsal? Choosing samples that
are best for learning, rather than simply selecting them at random, could lead
to significantly faster learning. For class incremental learning, prior work
has shown that a simple class balanced random selection policy outperforms more
sophisticated methods. Here, we revisit this question by exploring a new sample
selection policy called GRASP. GRASP selects the most prototypical (class
representative) samples first and then gradually selects less prototypical
(harder) examples to update the DNN. GRASP has little additional compute or
memory overhead compared to uniform selection, enabling it to scale to large
datasets. We evaluate GRASP and other policies by conducting CL experiments on
the large-scale ImageNet-1K and Places-LT image classification datasets. GRASP
outperforms all other rehearsal policies. Beyond vision, we also demonstrate
that GRASP is effective for CL on five text classification datasets.

predictions, nearest-neighbor examples also help humans make more accurate
decisions. Yet, leveraging this type of explanation to improve both human-AI
team accuracy and classifier's accuracy remains an open question. In this
paper, we aim to increase both types of accuracy by (1) comparing the input
image with post-hoc, nearest-neighbor explanations using a novel network
(AdvisingNet), and (2) employing a new reranking algorithm. Over different
baseline models, our method consistently improves the image classification
accuracy on CUB-200 and Cars-196 datasets. Interestingly, we also reach the
state-of-the-art human-AI team accuracy on CUB-200 where both humans and an
AdvisingNet make decisions on complementary subsets of images.

<p class="mathjax">Existing methods for optimal control struggle to deal with the complexity
commonly encountered in real-world systems, including dimensionality, process
error, model bias and data heterogeneity. Instead of tackling these system
complexities directly, researchers have typically sought to simplify models to
fit optimal control methods. But when is the optimal solution to an
approximate, stylized model better than an approximate solution to a more
accurate model? While this question has largely gone unanswered owing to the
difficulty of finding even approximate solutions for complex models, recent
algorithmic and computational advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
might finally allow us to address these questions. DRL methods have to date
been applied primarily in the context of games or robotic mechanics, which
operate under precisely known rules. Here, we demonstrate the ability for DRL
algorithms using deep neural networks to successfully approximate solutions
(the "policy function" or control rule) in a non-linear three-variable model
for a fishery without knowing or ever attempting to infer a model for the
process itself. We find that the reinforcement learning agent discovers an
effective simplification of the problem to obtain an interpretable control
rule. We show that the policy obtained with DRL is both more profitable and
more sustainable than any constant mortality policy -- the standard family of
policies considered in fishery management.

<p class="mathjax">Validating the safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) operating in open-ended,
dynamic environments is challenging as vehicles will eventually encounter
safety-critical situations for which there is not representative training data.
By increasing the coverage of different road and traffic conditions and by
including corner cases in simulation-based scenario testing, the safety of AVs
can be improved. However, the creation of corner case scenarios including
multiple agents is non-trivial. Our approach allows engineers to generate
novel, realistic corner cases based on historic traffic data and to explain why
situations were safety-critical. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic Lane
Graphs (PLGs) to describe a finite set of lane positions and directions in
which vehicles might travel. The structure of PLGs is learnt directly from
spatio-temporal traffic data. The graph model represents the actions of the
drivers in response to a given state in the form of a probabilistic policy. We
use reinforcement learning techniques to modify this policy and to generate
realistic and explainable corner case scenarios which can be used for assessing
the safety of AVs.

<p class="mathjax">The reflection characteristics of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)
depend on the phase response of the constituent unit cells, which is
necessarily frequency dependent. This paper investigates the role of an RIS
constituting unit cells with different phase-frequency profiles in a wide-band
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to improve the
achievable rate. We first propose a mathematical model for the phase-frequency
relationship parametrized by the phase-frequency profile's slope and
phase-shift corresponding to a realizable resonant RIS unit cell. Then,
modelling each RIS element with $b$ control bits, we propose a method for
selecting the parameter pairs to obtain a set of $2^b$ phase-frequency
profiles. The proposed method yields an RIS design that outperforms existing
designs over a wide range of user locations in a single-input, single-output
(SISO) OFDM system. We then propose a low-complexity optimization algorithm to
maximize the data rate through the joint optimization of (a) power allocations
across the sub-carriers and (b) phase-frequency profile for each RIS unit cell
from the available set. The analysis is then extended to a multi-user
multiple-input single-output (MISO) OFDM scenario. Numerical results show an
improvement in the coverage and achievable rates under the proposed framework
as compared to single-slope phase-frequency profiles.

especially for sparse reward tasks. To deal with the reward sparsity, people
commonly apply intrinsic rewards to motivate agents to explore the state space
efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a new intrinsic reward design called
GoBI - Go Beyond Imagination, which combines the traditional lifelong novelty
motivation with an episodic intrinsic reward that is designed to maximize the
stepwise reachability expansion. More specifically, we apply learned world
models to generate predicted future states with random actions. States with
more unique predictions that are not in episodic memory are assigned high
intrinsic rewards. Our method greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art

that brings the model to the user's device for training, avoiding the need to

heterogeneity and communication efficiency. In this paper, we propose RE-FL, a
novel approach that tackles computational and communication challenges in
resource-constrained devices. Our variable pruning technique optimizes resource
utilization by adapting pruning to each client's computational capabilities. We

<p class="mathjax">Computing planar orthogonal drawings with the minimum number of bends is one
of the most relevant topics in Graph Drawing. The problem is known to be
NP-hard, even when we want to test the existence of a rectilinear planar
drawing, i.e., an orthogonal drawing without bends (Garg and Tamassia, 2001).
From the parameterized complexity perspective, the problem is fixed-parameter
tractable when parameterized by the sum of three parameters: the number of
bends, the number of vertices of degree at most two, and the treewidth of the
input graph (Di Giacomo et al., 2022). We improve this last result by showing
that the problem remains fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized only by
the number of vertices of degree at most two plus the number of bends. As a
consequence, rectilinear planarity testing lies in \FPT~parameterized by the
number of vertices of degree at most two.

<p class="mathjax">Activation functions are the linchpins of deep learning, profoundly
influencing both the representational capacity and training dynamics of neural
networks. They shape not only the nature of representations but also optimize
convergence rates and enhance generalization potential. Appreciating this
critical role, we present the Linear Oscillation (LoC) activation function,
defined as $f(x) = x \times \sin(\alpha x + \beta)$. Distinct from conventional
activation functions which primarily introduce non-linearity, LoC seamlessly
blends linear trajectories with oscillatory deviations. The nomenclature
``Linear Oscillation'' is a nod to its unique attribute of infusing linear
activations with harmonious oscillations, capturing the essence of the
'Importance of Confusion'. This concept of ``controlled confusion'' within
network activations is posited to foster more robust learning, particularly in
contexts that necessitate discerning subtle patterns. Our empirical studies
reveal that, when integrated into diverse neural architectures, the LoC
activation function consistently outperforms established counterparts like ReLU
and Sigmoid. The stellar performance exhibited by the avant-garde Vision
Transformer model using LoC further validates its efficacy. This study
illuminates the remarkable benefits of the LoC over other prominent activation
functions. It champions the notion that intermittently introducing deliberate
complexity or ``confusion'' during training can spur more profound and nuanced
learning. This accentuates the pivotal role of judiciously selected activation
functions in shaping the future of neural network training.

<p class="mathjax">Visual place recognition tasks often encounter significant challenges in
landmark detection due to the presence of irrelevant objects such as humans,
cars, and trees, despite the remarkable progress achieved by previous models,
especially in the context of transformers. To address this issue, we propose a
novel method that effectively leverages the strengths of vision transformers.
By employing a meticulous selection process, our approach identifies and
isolates specific patches within the image that correspond to occluding
objects. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we created augmented datasets
and conducted comprehensive testing. The results demonstrate the superior
accuracy achieved by our proposed approach. This research contributes to the
advancement of landmark detection in visual place recognition and shows the
potential of leveraging vision transformers to overcome challenges posed by
cluttered real-world scenarios.

visible image fusion (IVIF), harnessing the power of multiple kernel sizes and
attention mechanisms. By assimilating thermal details from infrared images with
texture features from visible sources, our method produces images enriched with
comprehensive information. Distinct from prevailing deep learning
methodologies, our model encompasses a fusion mechanism powered by multiple
convolutional kernels, facilitating the robust capture of a wide feature
spectrum. Notably, we incorporate parallel attention mechanisms to emphasize
and retain pivotal target details in the resultant images. Moreover, the
integration of the multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) loss function
refines network training, optimizing the model for IVIF task. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in

<p class="mathjax">Symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) play a pivotal role in knowledge-centric
applications such as search, question answering and recommendation. As
contemporary language models (LMs) trained on extensive textual data have
gained prominence, researchers have extensively explored whether the parametric
knowledge within these models can match up to that present in knowledge graphs.
Various methodologies have indicated that enhancing the size of the model or
the volume of training data enhances its capacity to retrieve symbolic
knowledge, often with minimal or no human supervision. Despite these
advancements, there is a void in comprehensively evaluating whether LMs can
encompass the intricate topological and semantic attributes of KGs, attributes
crucial for reasoning processes. In this work, we provide an exhaustive
evaluation of language models of varying sizes and capabilities. We construct
nine qualitative benchmarks that encompass a spectrum of attributes including
symmetry, asymmetry, hierarchy, bidirectionality, compositionality, paths,
entity-centricity, bias and ambiguity. Additionally, we propose novel
evaluation metrics tailored for each of these attributes. Our extensive
evaluation of various LMs shows that while these models exhibit considerable
potential in recalling factual information, their ability to capture intricate
topological and semantic traits of KGs remains significantly constrained. We
note that our proposed evaluation metrics are more reliable in evaluating these
abilities than the existing metrics. Lastly, some of our benchmarks challenge
the common notion that larger LMs (e.g., GPT-4) universally outshine their
smaller counterparts (e.g., BERT).

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing and tracking deformable surface with little or no texture has
posed long-standing challenges. Fundamentally, the challenges stem from
textureless surfaces lacking features for establishing cross-image
correspondences. In this work, we present a novel type of markers to
proactively enrich the object's surface features, and thereby ease the 3D
surface reconstruction and correspondence tracking. Our markers are made of
fluorescent dyes, visible only under the ultraviolet (UV) light and invisible
under regular lighting condition. Leveraging the markers, we design a
multi-camera system that captures surface deformation under the UV light and
the visible light in a time multiplexing fashion. Under the UV light, markers
on the object emerge to enrich its surface texture, allowing high-quality 3D
shape reconstruction and tracking. Under the visible light, markers become
invisible, allowing us to capture the object's original untouched appearance.
We perform experiments on various challenging scenes, including hand gestures,
facial expressions, waving cloth, and hand-object interaction. In all these
cases, we demonstrate that our system is able to produce robust, high-quality
3D reconstruction and tracking.

<p class="mathjax">This decade is marked by the introduction of Vision Transformer, a radical
paradigm shift in broad computer vision. A similar trend is followed in medical
imaging, UNet, one of the most influential architectures, has been redesigned
with transformers. Recently, the efficacy of convolutional models in vision is
being reinvestigated by seminal works such as ConvNext, which elevates a ResNet
to Swin Transformer level. Deriving inspiration from this, we aim to improve a
purely convolutional UNet model so that it can be on par with the
transformer-based models, e.g, Swin-Unet or UCTransNet. We examined several
advantages of the transformer-based UNet models, primarily long-range
dependencies and cross-level skip connections. We attempted to emulate them
through convolution operations and thus propose, ACC-UNet, a completely
convolutional UNet model that brings the best of both worlds, the inherent
inductive biases of convnets with the design decisions of transformers.
ACC-UNet was evaluated on 5 different medical image segmentation benchmarks and
consistently outperformed convnets, transformers, and their hybrids. Notably,
ACC-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art models Swin-Unet and UCTransNet by $2.64
\pm 2.54\%$ and $0.45 \pm 1.61\%$ in terms of dice score, respectively, while
using a fraction of their parameters ($59.26\%$ and $24.24\%$). Our codes are

<p class="mathjax">Because scanning-LIDAR sensors require finite time to create a point cloud,
sensor motion during a scan warps the resulting image, a phenomenon known as
motion distortion or rolling shutter. Motion-distortion correction methods
exist, but they rely on external measurements or Bayesian filtering over
multiple LIDAR scans. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm that performs
snapshot processing to obtain a motion-distortion correction. Snapshot
processing, which registers a current LIDAR scan to a reference image without
using external sensors or Bayesian filtering, is particularly relevant for
localization to a high-definition (HD) map. Our approach, which we call
Velocity-corrected Iterative Compact Ellipsoidal Transformation (VICET),
extends the well-known Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) algorithm to solve
jointly for both a 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) rigid transform between two LIDAR
scans and a set of 6DOF motion states that describe distortion within the
current LIDAR scan. Using experiments, we show that VICET achieves
significantly higher accuracy than NDT or Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
algorithms when localizing a distorted raw LIDAR scan against an undistorted HD
Map. We recommend the reader explore our open-source code and visualizations at
https://github.com/mcdermatt/VICET, which supplements this manuscript.

<p class="mathjax">Beam search and exhaustive search are two extreme ends of text decoding
algorithms with respect to the search depth. Beam search is limited in both
search width and depth, whereas exhaustive search is a global search that has
no such limitations. Surprisingly, beam search is not only computationally
cheaper but also performs better than exhaustive search despite its higher
search error. Plenty of research has investigated a range of beam widths, from
small to large, and reported that a beam width that is neither too large nor
too small is desirable. However, in terms of search depth, only the two extreme
ends, beam search and exhaustive search are studied intensively. In this paper,
we examine a range of search depths between the two extremes to discover the
desirable search depth. To this end, we introduce Lookahead Beam Search (LBS),
a multi-step lookahead search that optimizes the objective considering a fixed
number of future steps. Beam search and exhaustive search are special cases of
LBS where the lookahead depth is set to $0$ and $\infty$, respectively. We
empirically evaluate the performance of LBS and find that it outperforms beam
search overall on machine translation tasks. The result suggests there is room
for improvement in beam search by searching deeper. Inspired by the analysis,
we propose Lookbehind Heuristic Beam Search, a computationally feasible search
algorithm that heuristically simulates LBS with 1-step lookahead. The empirical
results show that the proposed method outperforms vanilla beam search on
machine translation and text summarization tasks.

<p class="mathjax">A large number of studies on social media compare the behaviour of users from
different political parties. As a basic step, they employ a predictive model
for inferring their political affiliation. The accuracy of this model can
change the conclusions of a downstream analysis significantly, yet the choice
between different models seems to be made arbitrarily. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive survey and an empirical comparison of the current party
prediction practices and propose several new approaches which are competitive
with or outperform state-of-the-art methods, yet require less computational
resources. Party prediction models rely on the content generated by the users
(e.g., tweet texts), the relations they have (e.g., who they follow), or their
activities and interactions (e.g., which tweets they like). We examine all of
these and compare their signal strength for the party prediction task. This
paper lets the practitioner select from a wide range of data types that all
give strong performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on different
aspects of these methods, such as data collection speed and transfer
capabilities, which can provide further insights for both applied and
methodological research.

transfer, (ii) machine learning/artificial intelligence and traditional data
analysis approaches, and (iii) automatic metadata extraction and cataloging of
experimental results. This infrastructure supports expected workloads and also
provides domain scientists the ability to reinterrogate data from past
experiments to yield additional scientific value and derive new insights.

<p class="mathjax">Real-world time series data that commonly reflect sequential human behavior
are often uniquely irregularly sampled and sparse, with highly nonuniform
sampling over time and entities. Yet, commonly-used pretraining and
augmentation methods for time series are not specifically designed for such
scenarios. In this paper, we present PAITS (Pretraining and Augmentation for
Irregularly-sampled Time Series), a framework for identifying suitable
pretraining strategies for sparse and irregularly sampled time series datasets.
PAITS leverages a novel combination of NLP-inspired pretraining tasks and
augmentations, and a random search to identify an effective strategy for a
given dataset. We demonstrate that different datasets benefit from different
pretraining choices. Compared with prior methods, our approach is better able
to consistently improve pretraining across multiple datasets and domains. Our

<p class="mathjax">Online Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (O-JIT-SDP) uses an online
model to predict whether a new software change will introduce a bug or not.
However, existing studies neglect the interaction of Software Quality Assurance
(SQA) staff with the model, which may miss the opportunity to improve the
prediction accuracy through the feedback from SQA staff. To tackle this
problem, we propose Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) O-JIT-SDP that integrates feedback
from SQA staff to enhance the prediction process. Furthermore, we introduce a
performance evaluation framework that utilizes a k-fold distributed bootstrap
method along with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This framework facilitates
thorough pairwise comparisons of alternative classification algorithms using a
prequential evaluation approach. Our proposal enables continuous statistical
testing throughout the prequential process, empowering developers to make
real-time decisions based on robust statistical evidence. Through
experimentation across 10 GitHub projects, we demonstrate that our evaluation
framework enhances the credibility of model evaluation, and the incorporation
of HITL feedback elevates the prediction performance of online JIT-SDP models.
These advancements hold the potential to significantly enhance the value of
O-JIT-SDP for industrial applications.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we consider the problem of recovering a low-rank Tucker
approximation to a massive tensor based solely on structured random compressive
measurements. Crucially, the proposed random measurement ensembles are both
designed to be compactly represented (i.e., low-memory), and can also be
efficiently computed in one-pass over the tensor. Thus, the proposed
compressive sensing approach may be used to produce a low-rank factorization of
a huge tensor that is too large to store in memory with a total memory
footprint on the order of the much smaller desired low-rank factorization. In
addition, the compressive sensing recovery algorithm itself (which takes the
compressive measurements as input, and then outputs a low-rank factorization)
also runs in a time which principally depends only on the size of the sought
factorization, making its runtime sub-linear in the size of the large tensor
one is approximating. Finally, unlike prior works related to (streaming)
algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation from such compressive
measurements, we present a unified analysis of both Kronecker and Khatri-Rao
structured measurement ensembles culminating in error guarantees comparing the
error of our recovery algorithm's approximation of the input tensor to the best
possible low-rank Tucker approximation error achievable for the tensor by any
possible algorithm. We further include an empirical study of the proposed
approach that verifies our theoretical findings and explores various trade-offs
of parameters of interest.

<p class="mathjax">During the current mental health crisis, the importance of identifying
potential indicators of mental issues from social media content has surged.
Overlooking the multifaceted nature of mental and social well-being can have
detrimental effects on one's mental state. In traditional therapy sessions,
professionals manually pinpoint the origins and outcomes of underlying mental
challenges, a process both detailed and time-intensive. We introduce an
approach to this intricate mental health analysis by framing the identification
of wellness dimensions in Reddit content as a wellness concept extraction and
categorization challenge. We've curated a unique dataset named WELLXPLAIN,
comprising 3,092 entries and totaling 72,813 words. Drawing from Halbert L.
Dunn's well-regarded wellness theory, our team formulated an annotation
framework along with guidelines. This dataset also includes human-marked
textual segments, offering clear reasoning for decisions made in the wellness
concept categorization process. Our aim in publishing this dataset and
analyzing initial benchmarks is to spearhead the creation of advanced language
models tailored for healthcare-focused concept extraction and categorization.

<p class="mathjax">Recognizing and comprehending human actions and gestures is a crucial
perception requirement for robots to interact with humans and carry out tasks
in diverse domains, including service robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing.
Event cameras, with their ability to capture fast-moving objects at a high
temporal resolution, offer new opportunities compared to standard action
recognition in RGB videos. However, previous research on event camera action
recognition has primarily focused on sensor-specific network architectures and
image encoding, which may not be suitable for new sensors and limit the use of
recent advancements in transformer-based architectures. In this study, we
employ a computationally efficient model, namely the video transformer network
(VTN), which initially acquires spatial embeddings per event-frame and then
utilizes a temporal self-attention mechanism. In order to better adopt the VTN
for the sparse and fine-grained nature of event data, we design
Event-Contrastive Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{EC}$) and event-specific augmentations.
Proposed $\mathcal{L}_{EC}$ promotes learning fine-grained spatial cues in the
spatial backbone of VTN by contrasting temporally misaligned frames. We
evaluate our method on real-world action recognition of N-EPIC Kitchens
dataset, and achieve state-of-the-art results on both protocols - testing in
seen kitchen (\textbf{74.9\%} accuracy) and testing in unseen kitchens
(\textbf{42.43\% and 46.66\% Accuracy}). Our approach also takes less
computation time compared to competitive prior approaches, which demonstrates
the potential of our framework \textit{EventTransAct} for real-world
applications of event-camera based action recognition. Project Page:

<p class="mathjax">Current diffusion-based image restoration methods feed degraded input images
as conditions into the noise estimation network. However, interpreting this
diffusion process is challenging since it essentially generates the target
image from the noise. To establish a unified and more interpretable model for
image generation and restoration, we propose residual denoising diffusion
models (RDDM). In contrast to existing diffusion models (e.g., DDPM or DDIM)
that focus solely on noise estimation, our RDDM predicts residuals to represent
directional diffusion from the target domain to the input domain, while
concurrently estimating noise to account for random perturbations in the
diffusion process. The introduction of residuals allows us to redefine the
forward diffusion process, wherein the target image progressively diffuses into
a purely noisy image or a noise-carrying input image, thus unifying image
generation and restoration. We demonstrate that our sampling process is
consistent with that of DDPM and DDIM through coefficient transformation, and
propose a partially path-independent generation process to better understand
the reverse process. Notably, with native support for conditional inputs, our
RDDM enables a generic UNet, trained with only an $\ell _1$ loss and a batch
size of 1, to compete with state-of-the-art image restoration methods. We
provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration,
application, and development of our innovative framework
(https://github.com/nachifur/RDDM).

<p class="mathjax">Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, and
early detection can significantly improve outcomes for patients. Machine
learning (ML) models can help diagnose CVDs early, but their performance is
limited by the data available for model training. Privacy concerns in
healthcare make it harder to acquire data to train accurate ML models.
Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach to machine learning that allows
models to be trained on data from multiple sources without compromising the
privacy of the individual data owners. This survey paper provides an overview
of the current state-of-the-art in FL for CVD detection. We review the
different FL models proposed in various papers and discuss their advantages and
challenges. We also compare FL with traditional centralized learning approaches
and highlight the differences in terms of model accuracy, privacy, and data
distribution handling capacity. Finally, we provide a critical analysis of FL's
current challenges and limitations for CVD detection and discuss potential
avenues for future research. Overall, this survey paper aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in FL for CVD detection
and to highlight its potential for improving the accuracy and privacy of CVD
detection models.

<p class="mathjax">Lyric translation plays a pivotal role in amplifying the global resonance of
music, bridging cultural divides, and fostering universal connections.
Translating lyrics, unlike conventional translation tasks, requires a delicate
balance between singability and semantics. In this paper, we present a
computational framework for the quantitative evaluation of singable lyric
translation, which seamlessly integrates musical, linguistic, and cultural
dimensions of lyrics. Our comprehensive framework consists of four metrics that
measure syllable count distance, phoneme repetition similarity, musical
structure distance, and semantic similarity. To substantiate the efficacy of
our framework, we collected a singable lyrics dataset, which precisely aligns
English, Japanese, and Korean lyrics on a line-by-line and section-by-section
basis, and conducted a comparative analysis between singable and non-singable
lyrics. Our multidisciplinary approach provides insights into the key
components that underlie the art of lyric translation and establishes a solid
groundwork for the future of computational lyric translation assessment.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks (NNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art method for modeling
nonlinear systems in model predictive control (MPC). However, the robustness of
NNs, in terms of sensitivity to small input perturbations, remains a critical
challenge for practical applications. To address this, we develop
Lipschitz-Constrained Neural Networks (LCNNs) for modeling nonlinear systems
and derive rigorous theoretical results to demonstrate their effectiveness in
approximating Lipschitz functions, reducing input sensitivity, and preventing
over-fitting. Specifically, we first prove a universal approximation theorem to
show that LCNNs using SpectralDense layers can approximate any 1-Lipschitz
target function. Then, we prove a probabilistic generalization error bound for
LCNNs using SpectralDense layers by using their empirical Rademacher
complexity. Finally, the LCNNs are incorporated into the MPC scheme, and a
chemical process example is utilized to show that LCNN-based MPC outperforms
MPC using conventional feedforward NNs in the presence of training data noise.

<p class="mathjax">Data summarization is the process of generating interpretable and
representative subsets from a dataset. Existing time series summarization
approaches often search for recurring subsequences using a set of manually
devised similarity functions to summarize the data. However, such approaches
are fraught with limitations stemming from an exhaustive search coupled with a
heuristic definition of series similarity. Such approaches affect the diversity
and comprehensiveness of the generated data summaries. To mitigate these
limitations, we introduce an approach to time series summarization, called
Time-to-Pattern (T2P), which aims to find a set of diverse patterns that
together encode the most salient information, following the notion of minimum
description length. T2P is implemented as a deep generative model that learns
informative embeddings of the discrete time series on a latent space
specifically designed to be interpretable. Our synthetic and real-world
experiments reveal that T2P discovers informative patterns, even in noisy and
complex settings. Furthermore, our results also showcase the improved
performance of T2P over previous work in pattern diversity and processing
scalability, which conclusively demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness for
time series summarization.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the substantial achievements observed in Large Language Models
(LLMs) in the field of natural language processing, recent research has
commenced investigations into the application of LLMs for complex, long-horizon
sequential task planning challenges in robotics. LLMs are advantageous in
offering the potential to enhance the generalizability as task-agnostic
planners and facilitate flexible interaction between human instructors and
planning systems. However, task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility
and correctness. To address this challenge, we introduce ISR-LLM, a novel
framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement
process. The framework operates through three sequential steps: preprocessing,
planning, and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing, an LLM
translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain
Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase, an LLM planner
formulates an initial plan, which is then assessed and refined in the iterative
self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of
ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM
is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments
compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners. Moreover, it also preserves
the broad applicability and generalizability of working with natural language
instructions.

<p class="mathjax">Model fairness (a.k.a., bias) has become one of the most critical problems in
a wide range of AI applications. An unfair model in autonomous driving may
cause a traffic accident if corner cases (e.g., extreme weather) cannot be
fairly regarded; or it will incur healthcare disparities if the AI model
misdiagnoses a certain group of people (e.g., brown and black skin). In recent
years, there have been emerging research works on addressing unfairness, and
they mainly focus on a single unfair attribute, like skin tone; however,
real-world data commonly have multiple attributes, among which unfairness can
exist in more than one attribute, called 'multi-dimensional fairness'. In this
paper, we first reveal a strong correlation between the different unfair
attributes, i.e., optimizing fairness on one attribute will lead to the
collapse of others. Then, we propose a novel Multi-Dimension Fairness
framework, namely Muffin, which includes an automatic tool to unite
off-the-shelf models to improve the fairness on multiple attributes
simultaneously. Case studies on dermatology datasets with two unfair attributes
show that the existing approach can achieve 21.05% fairness improvement on the
first attribute while it makes the second attribute unfair by 1.85%. On the
other hand, the proposed Muffin can unite multiple models to achieve
simultaneously 26.32% and 20.37% fairness improvement on both attributes;
meanwhile, it obtains 5.58% accuracy gain.

<p class="mathjax">Binary neural networks (BNNs) have been widely adopted to reduce the
computational cost and memory storage on edge-computing devices by using
one-bit representation for activations and weights. However, as neural networks
become wider/deeper to improve accuracy and meet practical requirements, the
computational burden remains a significant challenge even on the binary
version. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method called
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) compression that learns to compress and accelerate
BNNs. The proposed architecture leverages an observation from previous works
that an output channel in a binary convolution can be computed using another
output channel and XNOR operations with weights that differ from the weights of
the reused channel. We first construct a fully connected graph with vertices
corresponding to output channels, where the distance between two vertices is
the number of different values between the weight sets used for these outputs.
Then, the MST of the graph with the minimum depth is proposed to reorder output
calculations, aiming to reduce computational cost and latency. Moreover, we
propose a new learning algorithm to reduce the total MST distance during
training. Experimental results on benchmark models demonstrate that our method
achieves significant compression ratios with negligible accuracy drops, making
it a promising approach for resource-constrained edge-computing devices.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, AI-generated music has made significant progress, with
several models performing well in multimodal and complex musical genres and
scenes. While objective metrics can be used to evaluate generative music, they
often lack interpretability for musical evaluation. Therefore, researchers
often resort to subjective user studies to assess the quality of the generated
works, which can be resource-intensive and less reproducible than objective
metrics. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the subjective, objective,
and combined methodologies for assessing AI-generated music, highlighting the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Ultimately, this study provides
a valuable reference for unifying generative AI in the field of music
evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Vignetting commonly occurs as a degradation in images resulting from factors
such as lens design, improper lens hood usage, and limitations in camera
sensors. This degradation affects image details, color accuracy, and presents
challenges in computational photography. Existing vignetting removal algorithms
predominantly rely on ideal physics assumptions and hand-crafted parameters,
resulting in ineffective removal of irregular vignetting and suboptimal
results. Moreover, the substantial lack of real-world vignetting datasets
hinders the objective and comprehensive evaluation of vignetting removal. To
address these challenges, we present Vigset, a pioneering dataset for vignette
removal. Vigset includes 983 pairs of both vignetting and vignetting-free
high-resolution ($5340\times3697$) real-world images under various conditions.
In addition, We introduce DeVigNet, a novel frequency-aware Transformer
architecture designed for vignetting removal. Through the Laplacian Pyramid
decomposition, we propose the Dual Aggregated Fusion Transformer to handle
global features and remove vignetting in the low-frequency domain.
Additionally, we introduce the Adaptive Channel Expansion Module to enhance
details in the high-frequency domain. The experiments demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Interactive medical image segmentation refers to the accurate segmentation of
the target of interest through interaction (e.g., click) between the user and
the image. It has been widely studied in recent years as it is less dependent
on abundant annotated data and more flexible than fully automated segmentation.
However, current studies have not fully explored user-provided prompt
information (e.g., points), including the knowledge mined in one interaction,
and the relationship between multiple interactions. Thus, in this paper, we
introduce a novel framework equipped with prompt enhancement, called PE-MED,
for interactive medical image segmentation. First, we introduce a Self-Loop
strategy to generate warm initial segmentation results based on the first
prompt. It can prevent the highly unfavorable scenarios, such as encountering a
blank mask as the initial input after the first interaction. Second, we propose
a novel Prompt Attention Learning Module (PALM) to mine useful prompt
information in one interaction, enhancing the responsiveness of the network to
user clicks. Last, we build a Time Series Information Propagation (TSIP)
mechanism to extract the temporal relationships between multiple interactions
and increase the model stability. Comparative experiments with other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation algorithms show that our
method exhibits better segmentation accuracy and stability.

<p class="mathjax">Patent retrieval has been attracting tremendous interest from researchers in
intellectual property and information retrieval communities in the past
decades. However, most existing approaches rely on textual and metadata
information of the patent, and content-based image-based patent retrieval is
rarely investigated. Based on traits of patent drawing images, we present a
simple and lightweight model for this task. Without bells and whistles, this
approach significantly outperforms other counterparts on a large-scale
benchmark and noticeably improves the state-of-the-art by 33.5% with the mean
average precision (mAP) score. Further experiments reveal that this model can
be elaborately scaled up to achieve a surprisingly high mAP of 93.5%. Our
method ranks first in the ECCV 2022 Patent Diagram Image Retrieval Challenge.

<p class="mathjax">Developers introduce code clones to improve programming productivity. Many
existing studies have achieved impressive performance in monolingual code clone
detection. However, during software development, more and more developers write
semantically equivalent programs with different languages to support different
platforms and help developers translate projects from one language to another.
Considering that collecting cross-language parallel data, especially for
low-resource languages, is expensive and time-consuming, how designing an
effective cross-language model that does not rely on any parallel data is a
significant problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named ZC3 for
Zero-shot Cross-language Code Clone detection. ZC3 designs the contrastive
snippet prediction to form an isomorphic representation space among different
programming languages. Based on this, ZC3 exploits domain-aware learning and
cycle consistency learning to further constrain the model to generate
representations that are aligned among different languages meanwhile are
diacritical for different types of clones. To evaluate our approach, we conduct
extensive experiments on four representative cross-language clone detection
datasets. Experimental results show that ZC3 outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines by 67.12%, 51.39%, 14.85%, and 53.01% on the MAP score, respectively.
We further investigate the representational distribution of different languages
and discuss the effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graphs (KGs) are becoming essential resources for many downstream
applications. However, their incompleteness may limit their potential. Thus,
continuous curation is needed to mitigate this problem. One of the strategies
to address this problem is KG alignment, i.e., forming a more complete KG by
merging two or more KGs. This paper proposes i-Align, an interpretable KG
alignment model. Unlike the existing KG alignment models, i-Align provides an
explanation for each alignment prediction while maintaining high alignment
performance. Experts can use the explanation to check the correctness of the
alignment prediction. Thus, the high quality of a KG can be maintained during
the curation process (e.g., the merging process of two KGs). To this end, a
novel Transformer-based Graph Encoder (Trans-GE) is proposed as a key component
of i-Align for aggregating information from entities' neighbors (structures).
Trans-GE uses Edge-gated Attention that combines the adjacency matrix and the
self-attention matrix to learn a gating mechanism to control the information
aggregation from the neighboring entities. It also uses historical embeddings,
allowing Trans-GE to be trained over mini-batches, or smaller sub-graphs, to
address the scalability issue when encoding a large KG. Another component of
i-Align is a Transformer encoder for aggregating entities' attributes. This
way, i-Align can generate explanations in the form of a set of the most
influential attributes/neighbors based on attention weights. Extensive
experiments are conducted to show the power of i-Align. The experiments include
several aspects, such as the model's effectiveness for aligning KGs, the
quality of the generated explanations, and its practicality for aligning large
KGs. The results show the effectiveness of i-Align in these aspects.

<p class="mathjax">The numerical solution of continuum damage mechanics (CDM) problems suffers
from critical points during the material softening stage, and consequently
existing iterative solvers are subject to a trade-off between computational
expense and solution accuracy. Displacement-controlled arc-length methods were
developed to address these challenges, but are currently applicable only to
geometrically non-linear problems. In this work, we present a novel
displacement-controlled arc-length (DAL) method for CDM problems in both local
damage and non-local gradient damage versions. The analytical tangent matrix is
derived for the DAL solver in both of the local and the non-local models. In
addition, several consistent and non-consistent implementation algorithms are
proposed, implemented, and evaluated. Unlike existing force-controlled
arc-length solvers that monolithically scale the external force vector, the
proposed method treats the external force vector as an independent variable and
determines the position of the system on the equilibrium path based on all the
nodal variations of the external force vector. Such a flexible approach renders
the proposed solver to be substantially more efficient and versatile than
existing solvers used in CDM problems. The considerable advantages of the
proposed DAL algorithm are demonstrated against several benchmark 1D problems
with sharp snap-backs and 2D examples with various boundary conditions and
loading scenarios, where the proposed method drastically outperforms existing
conventional approaches in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and the
ability to predict the complete equilibrium path including all critical points.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits a capability to segment a wide
array of objects in natural images, serving as a versatile perceptual tool for
various downstream image segmentation tasks. In contrast, medical image
segmentation tasks often rely on domain-specific knowledge (DSK). In this
paper, we propose a novel method that combines the segmentation foundation
model (i.e., SAM) with domain-specific knowledge for reliable utilization of
unlabeled images in building a medical image segmentation model. Our new method
is iterative and consists of two main stages: (1) segmentation model training;
(2) expanding the labeled set by using the trained segmentation model, an
unlabeled set, SAM, and domain-specific knowledge. These two stages are
repeated until no more samples are added to the labeled set. A novel
optimal-matching-based method is developed for combining the SAM-generated
segmentation proposals and pixel-level and image-level DSK for constructing
annotations of unlabeled images in the iterative stage (2). In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for breast cancer
segmentation in ultrasound images, polyp segmentation in endoscopic images, and
skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images. Our work initiates a new
direction of semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation: the
segmentation foundation model can be harnessed as a valuable tool for
label-efficient segmentation learning in medical image segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">The integration of external personalized context information into
document-grounded conversational systems has significant potential business
value, but has not been well-studied. Motivated by the concept of personalized
context-aware document-grounded conversational systems, we introduce the task
of context-aware passage retrieval. We also construct a dataset specifically
curated for this purpose. We describe multiple baseline systems to address this
task, and propose a novel approach, Personalized Context-Aware Search (PCAS),
that effectively harnesses contextual information during passage retrieval.
Experimental evaluations conducted on multiple popular dense retrieval systems
demonstrate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baselines in
retrieving the most relevant passage but also excels at identifying the
pertinent context among all the available contexts. We envision that our
contributions will serve as a catalyst for inspiring future research endeavors
in this promising direction.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing RGB-T tracking networks extract modality features in a separate
manner, which lacks interaction and mutual guidance between modalities. This
limits the network's ability to adapt to the diverse dual-modality appearances
of targets and the dynamic relationships between the modalities. Additionally,
the three-stage fusion tracking paradigm followed by these networks
significantly restricts the tracking speed. To overcome these problems, we
propose a unified single-stage Transformer RGB-T tracking network, namely
USTrack, which unifies the above three stages into a single ViT (Vision
Transformer) backbone with a dual embedding layer through self-attention
mechanism. With this structure, the network can extract fusion features of the
template and search region under the mutual interaction of modalities.
Simultaneously, relation modeling is performed between these features,
efficiently obtaining the search region fusion features with better
target-background discriminability for prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel feature selection mechanism based on modality reliability to mitigate the
influence of invalid modalities for prediction, further improving the tracking
performance. Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining the fastest inference speed 84.2FPS. In particular, MPR/MSR on the
short-term and long-term subsets of VTUAV dataset increased by
11.1$\%$/11.7$\%$ and 11.3$\%$/9.7$\%$.

<p class="mathjax">The Diffusion Model (DM) has emerged as the SOTA approach for image
synthesis. However, the existing DM cannot perform well on some image-to-image
translation (I2I) tasks. Different from image synthesis, some I2I tasks, such
as super-resolution, require generating results in accordance with GT images.
Traditional DMs for image synthesis require extensive iterations and large
denoising models to estimate entire images, which gives their strong generative
ability but also leads to artifacts and inefficiency for I2I. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a simple, efficient, and powerful DM framework for I2I,
called DiffI2I. Specifically, DiffI2I comprises three key components: a compact
I2I prior extraction network (CPEN), a dynamic I2I transformer (DI2Iformer),
and a denoising network. We train DiffI2I in two stages: pretraining and DM
training. For pretraining, GT and input images are fed into CPEN$_{S1}$ to
capture a compact I2I prior representation (IPR) guiding DI2Iformer. In the
second stage, the DM is trained to only use the input images to estimate the
same IRP as CPEN$_{S1}$. Compared to traditional DMs, the compact IPR enables
DiffI2I to obtain more accurate outcomes and employ a lighter denoising network
and fewer iterations. Through extensive experiments on various I2I tasks, we
demonstrate that DiffI2I achieves SOTA performance while significantly reducing
computational burdens.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we tackle the emerging challenge of unintended harmful content
generation in Large Language Models (LLMs) with a novel dual-stage optimisation
technique using adversarial fine-tuning. Our two-pronged approach employs an
adversarial model, fine-tuned to generate potentially harmful prompts, and a
judge model, iteratively optimised to discern these prompts. In this
adversarial cycle, the two models seek to outperform each other in the
prompting phase, generating a dataset of rich examples which are then used for
fine-tuning. This iterative application of prompting and fine-tuning allows
continuous refinement and improved performance. The performance of our approach
is evaluated through classification accuracy on a dataset consisting of
problematic prompts not detected by GPT-4, as well as a selection of
contentious but unproblematic prompts. We show considerable increase in
classification accuracy of the judge model on this challenging dataset as it
undergoes the optimisation process. Furthermore, we show that a rudimentary
model \texttt{ada} can achieve 13\% higher accuracy on the hold-out test set
than GPT-4 after only a few rounds of this process, and that this fine-tuning
improves performance in parallel tasks such as toxic comment identification.

<p class="mathjax">Document digitization is vital for preserving historical records, efficient
document management, and advancing OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
research. Document Layout Analysis (DLA) involves segmenting documents into
meaningful units like text boxes, paragraphs, images, and tables. Challenges
arise when dealing with diverse layouts, historical documents, and unique
scripts like Bengali, hindered by the lack of comprehensive Bengali DLA
datasets. We improved the accuracy of the DLA model for Bengali documents by
utilizing advanced Mask R-CNN models available in the Detectron2 library. Our
evaluation involved three variants: Mask R-CNN R-50, R-101, and X-101, both
with and without pretrained weights from PubLayNet, on the BaDLAD dataset,
which contains human-annotated Bengali documents in four categories: text
boxes, paragraphs, images, and tables. Results show the effectiveness of these
models in accurately segmenting Bengali documents. We discuss speed-accuracy
tradeoffs and underscore the significance of pretrained weights. Our findings
expand the applicability of Mask R-CNN in document layout analysis, efficient
document management, and OCR research while suggesting future avenues for
fine-tuning and data augmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research understands the residual networks from a new perspective of
the implicit ensemble model. From this view, previous methods such as
stochastic depth and stimulative training have further improved the performance
of the residual network by sampling and training of its subnets. However, they
both use the same supervision for all subnets of different capacities and
neglect the valuable knowledge generated by subnets during training. In this
manuscript, we mitigate the significant knowledge distillation gap caused by
using the same kind of supervision and advocate leveraging the subnets to
provide diverse knowledge. Based on this motivation, we propose a group
knowledge based training framework for boosting the performance of residual
networks. Specifically, we implicitly divide all subnets into hierarchical
groups by subnet-in-subnet sampling, aggregate the knowledge of different
subnets in each group during training, and exploit upper-level group knowledge
to supervise lower-level subnet groups. Meanwhile, We also develop a subnet
sampling strategy that naturally samples larger subnets, which are found to be
more helpful than smaller subnets in boosting performance for hierarchical
groups. Compared with typical subnet training and other methods, our method
achieves the best efficiency and performance trade-offs on multiple datasets
and network structures. The code will be released soon.

<p class="mathjax">In the symbolic verification of cryptographic protocols, a central problem is
deciding whether a protocol admits an execution which leaks a designated secret
to the malicious intruder. Rusinowitch &amp; Turuani (2003) show that, when
considering finitely many sessions, this ``insecurity problem'' is NP-complete.
Central to their proof strategy is the observation that any execution of a
protocol can be simulated by one where the intruder only communicates terms of
bounded size. However, when we consider models where, in addition to terms, one
can also communicate logical statements about terms, the analysis of the
insecurity problem becomes tricky when both these inference systems are
considered together. In this paper we consider the insecurity problem for
protocols with logical statements that include {\em equality on terms} and {\em
existential quantification}. Witnesses for existential quantifiers may be
unbounded, and obtaining small witness terms while maintaining equality proofs
complicates the analysis considerably. We extend techniques from Rusinowitch &amp;
Turuani (2003) to show that this problem is also in NP.

<p class="mathjax">Hash representation learning of multi-view heterogeneous data is the key to
improving the accuracy of multimedia retrieval. However, existing methods
utilize local similarity and fall short of deeply fusing the multi-view
features, resulting in poor retrieval accuracy. Current methods only use local
similarity to train their model. These methods ignore global similarity.
Furthermore, most recent works fuse the multi-view features via a weighted sum
or concatenation. We contend that these fusion methods are insufficient for
capturing the interaction between various views. We present a novel Central
Similarity Multi-View Hashing (CSMVH) method to address the mentioned problems.
Central similarity learning is used for solving the local similarity problem,
which can utilize the global similarity between the hash center and samples. We
present copious empirical data demonstrating the superiority of gate-based
fusion over conventional approaches. On the MS COCO and NUS-WIDE, the proposed
CSMVH performs better than the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (up
to 11.41% mean Average Precision (mAP) improvement).

<p class="mathjax">Existing studies show that code summaries help developers understand and
maintain source code. Unfortunately, these summaries are often missing or
outdated in software projects. Code summarization aims to generate natural
language descriptions automatically for source code. Code summaries are highly
structured and have repetitive patterns. Besides the patternized words, a code
summary also contains important keywords, which are the key to reflecting the
functionality of the code. However, the state-of-the-art approaches perform
poorly on predicting the keywords, which leads to the generated summaries
suffering a loss in informativeness. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel retrieve-and-edit approach named EditSum for code
summarization. Specifically, EditSum first retrieves a similar code snippet
from a pre-defined corpus and treats its summary as a prototype summary to
learn the pattern. Then, EditSum edits the prototype automatically to combine
the pattern in the prototype with the semantic information of input code. Our
motivation is that the retrieved prototype provides a good start-point for
post-generation because the summaries of similar code snippets often have the
same pattern. The post-editing process further reuses the patternized words in
the prototype and generates keywords based on the semantic information of input
code. We conduct experiments on a large-scale Java corpus and experimental
results demonstrate that EditSum outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by
a substantial margin. The human evaluation also proves the summaries generated
by EditSum are more informative and useful. We also verify that EditSum
performs well on predicting the patternized words and keywords.

<p class="mathjax">Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are a standard tool in data analysis. However,
they face problems when applied to high-dimensional data (e.g., images) due to
the size of the required full covariance matrices (CMs), whereas the use of
diagonal or spherical CMs often imposes restrictions that are too severe. The
Mixture of Factor analyzers (MFA) model is an important extension of GMMs,
which allows to smoothly interpolate between diagonal and full CMs based on the
number of \textit{factor loadings} $l$. MFA has successfully been applied for
modeling high-dimensional image data. This article contributes both a
theoretical analysis as well as a new method for efficient high-dimensional MFA
training by stochastic gradient descent, starting from random centroid
initializations. This greatly simplifies the training and initialization
process, and avoids problems of batch-type algorithms such
Expectation-Maximization (EM) when training with huge amounts of data. In
addition, by exploiting the properties of the matrix determinant lemma, we
prove that MFA training and inference/sampling can be performed based on
precision matrices, which does not require matrix inversions after training is
completed. At training time, the methods requires the inversion of $l\times l$
matrices only. Besides the theoretical analysis and proofs, we apply MFA to
typical image datasets such as SVHN and MNIST, and demonstrate the ability to
perform sample generation and outlier detection.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel zero-shot edge detection with SCESAME, which
stands for Spectral Clustering-based Ensemble for Segment Anything Model
Estimation, based on the recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM is
a foundation model for segmentation tasks, and one of the interesting
applications of SAM is Automatic Mask Generation (AMG), which generates
zero-shot segmentation masks of an entire image. AMG can be applied to edge
detection, but suffers from the problem of overdetecting edges. Edge detection
with SCESAME overcomes this problem by three steps: (1) eliminating small
generated masks, (2) combining masks by spectral clustering, taking into
account mask positions and overlaps, and (3) removing artifacts after edge
detection. We performed edge detection experiments on two datasets, BSDS500 and
NYUDv2. Although our zero-shot approach is simple, the experimental results on
BSDS500 showed almost identical performance to human performance and CNN-based
methods from seven years ago. In the NYUDv2 experiments, it performed almost as
well as recent CNN-based methods. These results indicate that our method has
the potential to be a strong baseline for future zero-shot edge detection
methods. Furthermore, SCESAME is not only applicable to edge detection, but
also to other downstream zero-shot tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the superior performance of large language models to generate natural
language texts, it is hard to generate texts with correct logic according to a
given task, due to the difficulties for neural models to capture implied rules
from free-form texts. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based language
model, Logical-GLM, to infuse logic into language models for more valid text
generation and interpretability. Specifically, we first capture information
from natural language instructions and construct logical bayes graphs that
generally describe domains. Next, we generate logical skeletons to guide
language model training, infusing domain knowledge into language models.
Finally, we alternately optimize the searching policy of graphs and language
models until convergence. The experimental results show that Logical-GLM is
both effective and efficient compared with traditional language models, despite
using smaller-scale training data and fewer parameters. Our approach can
generate instructional texts with more correct logic owing to the internalized
domain knowledge. Moreover, the usage of logical graphs reflects the inner
mechanism of the language models, which improves the interpretability of
black-box models.

<p class="mathjax">Lightness adaptation is vital to the success of image processing to avoid
unexpected visual deterioration, which covers multiple aspects, e.g., low-light
image enhancement, image retouching, and inverse tone mapping. Existing methods
typically work well on their trained lightness conditions but perform poorly in
unknown ones due to their limited generalization ability. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalized lightness adaptation algorithm that
extends conventional normalization techniques through a channel filtering
design, dubbed Channel Selective Normalization (CSNorm). The proposed CSNorm
purposely normalizes the statistics of lightness-relevant channels and keeps
other channels unchanged, so as to improve feature generalization and
discrimination. To optimize CSNorm, we propose an alternating training strategy
that effectively identifies lightness-relevant channels. The model equipped
with our CSNorm only needs to be trained on one lightness condition and can be
well generalized to unknown lightness conditions. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CSNorm in
enhancing the generalization ability for the existing lightness adaptation
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mdyao/CSNorm.

<p class="mathjax">Avoiding synthesizing specific visual concepts is an essential challenge in
responsible visual synthesis. However, the visual concept that needs to be
avoided for responsible visual synthesis tends to be diverse, depending on the
region, context, and usage scenarios. In this work, we formalize a new task,
Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES), where the synthesis model
is able to avoid forbidden visual concepts while allowing users to input any
desired content. To address this problem, we present a Two-stage Intervention
(TIN) framework. By introducing 1) rewriting with learnable instruction through
a large-scale language model (LLM) and 2) synthesizing with prompt intervention
on a diffusion synthesis model, it can effectively synthesize images avoiding
any concepts but following the user's query as much as possible. To evaluate on
ORES, we provide a publicly available dataset, baseline models, and benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing
risks of image generation. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs in
responsible visual synthesis. Our code and dataset is public available.

<p class="mathjax">A common approach for out-of-distribution detection involves estimating an
underlying data distribution, which assigns a lower likelihood value to
out-of-distribution data. Normalizing flows are likelihood-based generative
models providing a tractable density estimation via dimension-preserving
invertible transformations. Conventional normalizing flows are prone to fail in
out-of-distribution detection, because of the well-known curse of
dimensionality problem of the likelihood-based models. According to the
manifold hypothesis, real-world data often lie on a low-dimensional manifold.
This study investigates the effect of manifold learning using normalizing flows
on out-of-distribution detection. We proceed by estimating the density on a
low-dimensional manifold, coupled with measuring the distance from the
manifold, as criteria for out-of-distribution detection. However, individually,
each of them is insufficient for this task. The extensive experimental results
show that manifold learning improves the out-of-distribution detection ability
of a class of likelihood-based models known as normalizing flows. This
improvement is achieved without modifying the model structure or using
auxiliary out-of-distribution data during training.

<p class="mathjax">The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and network slicing (NS) paradigms
have been envisioned as key enablers for flexible and intelligent manufacturing
in the industry 4.0, where a myriad of interconnected machines, sensors, and
devices of diversified quality of service (QoS) requirements coexist. To
optimize network resource usage, stakeholders in the IIoT network are
encouraged to take pragmatic steps towards resource sharing. However, resource
sharing is only attractive if the entities involved are able to settle on a
fair exchange of resource for remuneration in a win-win situation. In this
paper, we design an economic model that analyzes the multilateral strategic
trading interactions between sliced tenants in IIoT networks. We formulate the
resource pricing and purchasing problem of the seller and buyer tenants as a
cooperative Stackelberg game. Particularly, the cooperative game enforces
collaboration among the buyer tenants by coalition formation in order to
strengthen their position in resource price negotiations as opposed to acting
individually, while the Stackelberg game determines the optimal policy
optimization of the seller tenants and buyer tenant coalitions. To achieve a
Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)
method is developed to make flexible pricing and purchasing decisions without
prior knowledge of the environment. Simulation results and analysis prove that
the proposed method achieves convergence and is superior to other baselines, in
terms of utility maximization.

<p class="mathjax">In the field of autonomous driving, accurate and comprehensive perception of
the 3D environment is crucial. Bird's Eye View (BEV) based methods have emerged
as a promising solution for 3D object detection using multi-view images as
input. However, existing 3D object detection methods often ignore the physical
context in the environment, such as sidewalk and vegetation, resulting in
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called
SOGDet (Semantic-Occupancy Guided Multi-view 3D Object Detection), that
leverages a 3D semantic-occupancy branch to improve the accuracy of 3D object
detection. In particular, the physical context modeled by semantic occupancy
helps the detector to perceive the scenes in a more holistic view. Our SOGDet
is flexible to use and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing
BEV-based methods. To evaluate its effectiveness, we apply this approach to
several state-of-the-art baselines and conduct extensive experiments on the
exclusive nuScenes dataset. Our results show that SOGDet consistently enhance
the performance of three baseline methods in terms of nuScenes Detection Score
(NDS) and mean Average Precision (mAP). This indicates that the combination of
3D object detection and 3D semantic occupancy leads to a more comprehensive
perception of the 3D environment, thereby aiding build more robust autonomous
driving systems. The codes are available at: https://github.com/zhouqiu/SOGDet.

<p class="mathjax">Interior design is crucial in creating aesthetically pleasing and functional
indoor spaces. However, developing and editing interior design concepts
requires significant time and expertise. We propose Virtual Interior DESign
(VIDES) system in response to this challenge. Leveraging cutting-edge
technology in generative AI, our system can assist users in generating and
editing indoor scene concepts quickly, given user text description and visual
guidance. Using both visual guidance and language as the conditional inputs
significantly enhances the accuracy and coherence of the generated scenes,
resulting in visually appealing designs. Through extensive experimentation, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of VIDES in developing new indoor concepts,
changing indoor styles, and replacing and removing interior objects. The system
successfully captures the essence of users' descriptions while providing
flexibility for customization. Consequently, this system can potentially reduce
the entry barrier for indoor design, making it more accessible to users with
limited technical skills and reducing the time required to create high-quality
images. Individuals who have a background in design can now easily communicate
their ideas visually and effectively present their design concepts.

<p class="mathjax">Time series forecasting is prevalent in various real-world applications.
Despite the promising results of deep learning models in time series
forecasting, especially the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the explanations
of time series models, which are critical in high-stakes applications, have
received little attention. In this paper, we propose a Decomposition-based
Linear Explainable LSTM (DeLELSTM) to improve the interpretability of LSTM.
Conventionally, the interpretability of RNNs only concentrates on the variable
importance and time importance. We additionally distinguish between the
instantaneous influence of new coming data and the long-term effects of
historical data. Specifically, DeLELSTM consists of two components, i.e.,
standard LSTM and tensorized LSTM. The tensorized LSTM assigns each variable
with a unique hidden state making up a matrix $\mathbf{h}_t$, and the standard
LSTM models all the variables with a shared hidden state $\mathbf{H}_t$. By
decomposing the $\mathbf{H}_t$ into the linear combination of past information
$\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$ and the fresh information $\mathbf{h}_{t}-\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$,
we can get the instantaneous influence and the long-term effect of each
variable. In addition, the advantage of linear regression also makes the
explanation transparent and clear. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
interpretability of DeLELSTM on three empirical datasets. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance against the
baseline methods and provides a reliable explanation relative to domain
knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">The fashion e-commerce industry has witnessed significant growth in recent
years, prompting exploring image-based virtual try-on techniques to incorporate
Augmented Reality (AR) experiences into online shopping platforms. However,
existing research has primarily overlooked a crucial aspect - the runtime of
the underlying machine-learning model. While existing methods prioritize
enhancing output quality, they often disregard the execution time, which
restricts their applications on a limited range of devices. To address this
gap, we propose Distilled Mobile Real-time Virtual Try-On (DM-VTON), a novel
virtual try-on framework designed to achieve simplicity and efficiency. Our
approach is based on a knowledge distillation scheme that leverages a strong
Teacher network as supervision to guide a Student network without relying on
human parsing. Notably, we introduce an efficient Mobile Generative Module
within the Student network, significantly reducing the runtime while ensuring
high-quality output. Additionally, we propose Virtual Try-on-guided Pose for
Data Synthesis to address the limited pose variation observed in training
images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 40
frames per second on a single Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU and only take up 37 MB of
memory while producing almost the same output quality as other state-of-the-art
methods. DM-VTON stands poised to facilitate the advancement of real-time AR
applications, in addition to the generation of lifelike attired human figures
tailored for diverse specialized training tasks.

deployed a Member-to-Leader Multi-Agent framework to extract and fuse features
from multi-modal information, aiming to acquire a more comprehensive
understanding of the feature space. Furthermore, this approach facilitated the
incorporation of self-supervised learning to enhance model training. We
employed a clustering method with varying constraint conditions, ranging from
strict to loose, allowing for the generation of dependable labels for a subset
of unlabeled data during the training phase. This iterative process is similar
to human exploratory learning of unknown data. These mechanisms collectively
update the network parameters based on rewards received from environmental
feedback. This process enables effective control over the extent of exploration
learning, ensuring the accuracy of learning in unknown data categories. We
demonstrate the performance of our approach in both the 3D and 2D domains by
employing the OS-MN40, OS-MN40-Miss, and Cifar10 datasets. Our approach
achieves competitive competitive results.

<p class="mathjax">As an important goal of high-performance computing, the concept of
performance portability has been around for many years. As the failure of
Moore's Law, it is no longer feasible to improve computer performance by simply
increasing the number of existing hardware. The innovation of high performance
computer is imperative, which makes high-performance computers with multiple
architectures coexist in the production environment. For example, current
high-performance computing nodes often use co-accelerators such like
general-purpose GPUs and Intel Xeon Phis to accelerate general-purpose
processors. With the flourishing of deep learning, dedicated neural network
acceleration chips are also arising. The emergence of co-accelerators with
different architectures and their wide application in high-performance
computers have challenged the performance portability of programs between
high-performance computers with different architectures. This article
summarizes the current performance portability technology from the programming
model, serial code automatic parallelization, parallel code automatic
conversion, etc. at the end of the article, it also summarizes how to use
scientific computing function libraries to improve performance and performance
portability of a program. Different application scenarios need different
implementation technologies to get performance portability. Program developers
choose performance portability solutions for their programs. In fact, they
balance programming efficiency and optimization effects under various
constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Deployment of real-time ML services on warehouse-scale infrastructures is on
the increase. Therefore, decreasing latency and increasing throughput of deep
neural network (DNN) inference applications that empower those services have
attracted attention from both academia and industry. A common solution to
address this challenge is leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs. To
improve the inference throughput of DNNs deployed on GPU accelerators, two
common approaches are employed: Batching and Multi-Tenancy. Our preliminary
experiments show that the effect of these approaches on the throughput depends
on the DNN architecture. Taking this observation into account, we design and
implement DNNScaler which aims to maximize the throughput of interactive
AI-powered services while meeting their latency requirements. DNNScaler first
detects the suitable approach (Batching or Multi-Tenancy) that would be most
beneficial for a DNN regarding throughput improvement. Then, it adjusts the
control knob of the detected approach (batch size for Batching and number of
co-located instances for Multi-Tenancy) to maintain the latency while
increasing the throughput. Conducting an extensive set of experiments using
well-known DNNs from a variety of domains, several popular datasets, and a
cutting-edge GPU, the results indicate that DNNScaler can improve the
throughput by up to 14x (218% on average) compared with the previously proposed
approach, while meeting the latency requirements of the services.

<p class="mathjax">Plant diseases are major causes of production losses and may have a
significant impact on the agricultural sector. Detecting pests as early as
possible can help increase crop yields and production efficiency. Several
robotic monitoring systems have been developed allowing to collect data and
provide a greater understanding of environmental processes. An agricultural
robot can enable accurate timely detection of pests, by traversing the field
autonomously and monitoring the entire cropped area within a field. However, in
many cases it is impossible to sample all plants due to resource limitations.
In this thesis, the development and evaluation of several sampling algorithms
are presented to address the challenge of an agriculture-monitoring ground
robot designed to locate insects in an agricultural field, where complete
sampling of all the plants is infeasible. Two situations were investigated in
simulation models that were specially developed as part of this thesis: where
no a-priori information on the insects is available and where prior information
on the insects distributions within the field is known. For the first
situation, seven algorithms were tested, each utilizing an approach to sample
the field without prior knowledge of it. For the second situation, we present
the development and evaluation of a dynamic sampling algorithm which utilizes
real-time information to prioritize sampling at suspected points, locate hot
spots and adapt sampling plans accordingly. The algorithm's performance was
compared to two existing algorithms using Tetranychidae insect data from
previous research. Analyses revealed that the dynamic algorithm outperformed
the others.

<p class="mathjax">While specifying an IoT-based system, software developers have to face a set
of challenges, spanning from selecting the hardware components to writing the
actual source code. Even though dedicated development environments are in
place, a nonexpert user might struggle with the over-choice problem in
selecting the proper component. By combining MDE and recommender systems, this
paper proposes an initial prototype, called ResyDuo, to assist Arduino
developers by providing two different artifacts, i. e. , hardware components
and software libraries. In particular, we make use of a widely adopted
collaborative filtering algorithm by collecting relevant information by means
of a dedicated data model. ResyDuo can retrieve hardware components by using
tags or existing Arduino projects stored on the ProjectHub repository. Then,
the system can eventually retrieve corresponding software libraries based on
the identified hardware devices. ResyDuo is equipped with a web-based interface
that allows users to easily select and configure the under-developing Arduino
project. To assess ResyDuos performances, we run the ten-fold crossvalidation
by adopting the grid search strategy to optimize the hyperparameters of the
CF-based algorithm. The conducted evaluation shows encouraging results even
though there is still room for improvement in terms of the examined metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling seeks to tame complexity during software development, by supporting
design, analysis, and stakeholder communication. Paradoxically, experiences
made by educators indicate that students often perceive modeling as adding
complexity, instead of reducing it. In this position paper, I analyse modeling
education from the lens of complexity science, a theoretical framework for the
study of complex systems. I revisit pedagogical literature where complexity
science has been used as a framework for general education and subject-specific
education in disciplines such as medicine, project management, and
sustainability. I revisit complexity-related challenges from modeling education
literature, discuss them in the light of complexity and present recommendations
for taming complexity when teaching modeling.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has gained increasing attention in the
community, in which the recently emerged diffusion models (DMs) have
promisingly shown stronger performance than the past approaches. While existing
state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation,
they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g., action occurrence
disorders, crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics
modeling, one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work, we investigate
strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs, for high-quality T2V
generation. Inspired by human intuition, we design an innovative dynamic scene
manager (dubbed as Dysen) module, which includes (step-1) extracting from input
text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement, (step-2) transforming
the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations, and
(step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable
details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) via
in-context learning, Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics
understanding. Finally, the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details
is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features, integrated into the
backbone T2V DM for video generating. Experiments on popular T2V datasets
suggest that our framework consistently outperforms prior arts with significant
margins, especially in the scenario with complex actions. Project page at

<p class="mathjax">We show that crowd counting can be viewed as a decomposable point querying
process. This formulation enables arbitrary points as input and jointly reasons
whether the points are crowd and where they locate. The querying processing,
however, raises an underlying problem on the number of necessary querying
points. Too few imply underestimation; too many increase computational
overhead. To address this dilemma, we introduce a decomposable structure, i.e.,
the point-query quadtree, and propose a new counting model, termed Point quEry
Transformer (PET). PET implements decomposable point querying via
data-dependent quadtree splitting, where each querying point could split into
four new points when necessary, thus enabling dynamic processing of sparse and
dense regions. Such a querying process yields an intuitive, universal modeling
of crowd as both the input and output are interpretable and steerable. We
demonstrate the applications of PET on a number of crowd-related tasks,
including fully-supervised crowd counting and localization, partial annotation
learning, and point annotation refinement, and also report state-of-the-art
performance. For the first time, we show that a single counting model can
address multiple crowd-related tasks across different learning paradigms. Code
is available at https://github.com/cxliu0/PET.

<p class="mathjax">Finding a transformation between two unknown probability distributions from
samples is crucial for modeling complex data distributions and perform tasks
such as density estimation, sample generation, and statistical inference. One
powerful framework for such transformations is normalizing flow, which
transforms an unknown distribution into a standard normal distribution using an
invertible network. In this paper, we introduce a novel model called SyMOT-Flow
that trains an invertible transformation by minimizing the symmetric maximum
mean discrepancy between samples from two unknown distributions, and we
incorporate an optimal transport cost as regularization to obtain a
short-distance and interpretable transformation. The resulted transformation
leads to more stable and accurate sample generation. We establish several
theoretical results for the proposed model and demonstrate its effectiveness
with low-dimensional illustrative examples as well as high-dimensional
generative samples obtained through the forward and reverse flows.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning methods have demonstrated outstanding performances on
classification and regression tasks on homogeneous data types (e.g., image,
audio, and text data). However, tabular data still poses a challenge with
classic machine learning approaches being often computationally cheaper and
equally effective than increasingly complex deep learning architectures. The
challenge arises from the fact that, in tabular data, the correlation among
features is weaker than the one from spatial or semantic relationships in
images or natural languages, and the dependency structures need to be modeled
without any prior information. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
architecture that exploits the data structural organization through
topologically constrained network representations to gain spatial information
from sparse tabular data. The resulting model leverages the power of
convolutions and is centered on a limited number of concepts from network
topology to guarantee (i) a data-centric, deterministic building pipeline; (ii)
a high level of interpretability over the inference process; and (iii) an
adequate room for scalability. We test our model on 18 benchmark datasets
against 5 classic machine learning and 3 deep learning models demonstrating
that our approach reaches state-of-the-art performances on these challenging
datasets. The code to reproduce all our experiments is provided at

<p class="mathjax">Scientific machine learning for learning dynamical systems is a powerful tool
that combines data-driven modeling models, physics-based modeling, and
empirical knowledge. It plays an essential role in an engineering design cycle
and digital twinning. In this work, we primarily focus on an operator inference
methodology that builds dynamical models, preferably in low-dimension, with a
prior hypothesis on the model structure, often determined by known physics or
given by experts. Then, for inference, we aim to learn the operators of a model
by setting up an appropriate optimization problem. One of the critical
properties of dynamical systems is{stability. However, such a property is not
guaranteed by the inferred models. In this work, we propose inference
formulations to learn quadratic models, which are stable by design. Precisely,
we discuss the parameterization of quadratic systems that are locally and
globally stable. Moreover, for quadratic systems with no stable point yet
bounded (e.g., Chaotic Lorenz model), we discuss an attractive trapping region
philosophy and a parameterization of such systems. Using those
parameterizations, we set up inference problems, which are then solved using a
gradient-based optimization method. Furthermore, to avoid numerical derivatives
and still learn continuous systems, we make use of an integration form of
differential equations. We present several numerical examples, illustrating the
preservation of stability and discussing its comparison with the existing
state-of-the-art approach to infer operators. By means of numerical examples,
we also demonstrate how proposed methods are employed to discover governing
equations and energy-preserving models.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-modal retrieval has become popular in recent years, particularly with
the rise of multimedia. Generally, the information from each modality exhibits
distinct representations and semantic information, which makes feature tends to
be in separate latent spaces encoded with dual-tower architecture and makes it
difficult to establish semantic relationships between modalities, resulting in
poor retrieval performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
for cross-modal retrieval which consists of a cross-modal mixer, a masked
autoencoder for pre-training, and a cross-modal retriever for downstream
tasks.In specific, we first adopt cross-modal mixer and mask modeling to fuse
the original modality and eliminate redundancy. Then, an encoder-decoder
architecture is applied to achieve a fuse-then-separate task in the
pre-training phase.We feed masked fused representations into the encoder and
reconstruct them with the decoder, ultimately separating the original data of
two modalities. In downstream tasks, we use the pre-trained encoder to build
the cross-modal retrieval method. Extensive experiments on 2 real-world
datasets show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
in video-audio matching tasks, improving retrieval accuracy by up to 2 times.
Furthermore, we prove our model performance by transferring it to other
downstream tasks as a universal model.

<p class="mathjax">Graphs represent interconnected structures prevalent in a myriad of
real-world scenarios. Effective graph analytics, such as graph learning
methods, enables users to gain profound insights from graph data, underpinning
various tasks including node classification and link prediction. However, these
methods often suffer from data imbalance, a common issue in graph data where
certain segments possess abundant data while others are scarce, thereby leading
to biased learning outcomes. This necessitates the emerging field of imbalanced
learning on graphs, which aims to correct these data distribution skews for
more accurate and representative learning outcomes. In this survey, we embark
on a comprehensive review of the literature on imbalanced learning on graphs.
We begin by providing a definitive understanding of the concept and related
terminologies, establishing a strong foundational understanding for readers.
Following this, we propose two comprehensive taxonomies: (1) the problem
taxonomy, which describes the forms of imbalance we consider, the associated
tasks, and potential solutions; (2) the technique taxonomy, which details key
strategies for addressing these imbalances, and aids readers in their method
selection process. Finally, we suggest prospective future directions for both
problems and techniques within the sphere of imbalanced learning on graphs,
fostering further innovation in this critical area.

<p class="mathjax">Ultrasound (US) imaging provides a safe and accessible solution to procedural
guidance and diagnostic imaging. The effective usage of conventional 2D US for
interventional guidance requires extensive experience to project the image
plane onto the patient, and the interpretation of images in diagnostics suffers
from high intra- and inter-user variability. 3D US reconstruction allows for
more consistent diagnosis and interpretation, but existing solutions are
limited in terms of equipment and applicability in real-time navigation. To
address these issues, we propose HoloPOCUS - a mixed reality US system (MR-US)
that overlays rich US information onto the user's vision in a point-of-care
setting. HoloPOCUS extends existing MR-US methods beyond placing a US plane in
the user's vision to include a 3D reconstruction and projection that can aid in
procedural guidance using conventional probes. We validated a tracking pipeline
that demonstrates higher accuracy compared to existing MR-US works.
Furthermore, user studies conducted via a phantom task showed significant
improvements in navigation duration when using our proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">In marine aquaculture, inspecting sea cages is an essential activity for
managing both the facilities' environmental impact and the quality of the fish
development process. Fish escape from fish farms into the open sea due to net
damage, which can result in significant financial losses and compromise the
nearby marine ecosystem. The traditional inspection system in use relies on
visual inspection by expert divers or ROVs, which is not only laborious,
time-consuming, and inaccurate but also largely dependent on the level of
knowledge of the operator and has a poor degree of verifiability. This article
presents a robotic-based automatic net defect detection system for aquaculture
net pens oriented to on-ROV processing and real-time detection. The proposed
system takes a video stream from an onboard camera of the ROV, employs a deep
learning detector, and segments the defective part of the image from the
background under different underwater conditions. The system was first tested
using a set of collected images for comparison with the state-of-the-art
approaches and then using the ROV inspection sequences to evaluate its
effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Results show that our approach presents
high levels of accuracy even for adverse scenarios and is adequate for
real-time processing on embedded platforms.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid advancement of smart city infrastructure, vehicle-to-network
(V2N) communication has emerged as a crucial technology to enable intelligent
transportation systems (ITS). The investigation of new methods to improve V2N
communications is sparked by the growing need for high-speed and dependable
communications in vehicular networks. To achieve ultra-reliable low latency
communication (URLLC) for V2N scenarios, we propose a smart meter (SM)-based
cognitive network (CN) architecture for V2N communications. Our scheme makes
use of SMs' available underutilized time resources to let them serve as
distributed access points (APs) for V2N communications to increase reliability
and decrease latency. We propose and investigate two algorithms for efficiently
associating vehicles with the appropriate SMs. Extensive simulations are
carried out for comprehensive performance evaluation of our proposed
architecture and algorithms under diverse system scenarios. Performance is
investigated with particular emphasis on communication latency and reliability,
which are also compared with the conventional base station (BS)-based V2N
architecture for further validation. The results highlight the value of
incorporating SMs into the current infrastructure and open the door for future
ITSs to utilize more effective and dependable V2N communications.

<p class="mathjax">Discovering a suitable coordinate transformation for nonlinear systems
enables the construction of simpler models, facilitating prediction, control,
and optimization for complex nonlinear systems. To that end, Koopman operator
theory offers a framework for global linearization for nonlinear systems,
thereby allowing the usage of linear tools for design studies. In this work, we
focus on the identification of global linearized embeddings for canonical
nonlinear Hamiltonian systems through a symplectic transformation. While this
task is often challenging, we leverage the power of deep learning to discover
the desired embeddings. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of Koopman
operators for systems with continuous spectra, we apply the lifting principle
and learn global cubicized embeddings. Additionally, a key emphasis is paid to
enforce the bounded stability for the dynamics of the discovered embeddings. We
demonstrate the capabilities of deep learning in acquiring compact symplectic
coordinate transformation and the corresponding simple dynamical models,
fostering data-driven learning of nonlinear canonical Hamiltonian systems, even
those with continuous spectra.

existing schemes by expressing them as transitive prefix authentication graphs,

<p class="mathjax">Data features and class probabilities are two main perspectives when, e.g.,
evaluating model results and identifying problematic items. Class probabilities
represent the likelihood that each instance belongs to a particular class,
which can be produced by probabilistic classifiers or even human labeling with
uncertainty. Since both perspectives are multi-dimensional data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used to extract informative
characteristics from them. However, existing methods either focus solely on the
data feature perspective or rely on class probability estimates to guide the DR
process. In contrast to previous work where separate views are linked to
conduct the analysis, we propose a novel approach, class-constrained t-SNE,
that combines data features and class probabilities in the same DR result.
Specifically, we combine them by balancing two corresponding components in a
cost function to optimize the positions of data points and iconic
representation of classes -- class landmarks. Furthermore, an interactive
user-adjustable parameter balances these two components so that users can focus
on the weighted perspectives of interest and also empowers a smooth visual
transition between varying perspectives to preserve the mental map. We
illustrate its application potential in model evaluation and visual-interactive
labeling. A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the DR results.

<p class="mathjax">In vanilla federated learning (FL) such as FedAvg, the parameter server (PS)
and multiple distributed clients can form a typical buyer's market, where the
number of PS/buyers of FL services is far less than the number of
clients/sellers. In order to improve the performance of FL and reduce the cost
of motivating clients to participate in FL, this paper proposes to
differentiate the pricing for services provided by different clients rather
than simply providing the same service pricing for different clients. The price
is differentiated based on the performance improvements brought to FL and their
heterogeneity in computing and communication capabilities. To this end, a
price-discrimination game (PDG) is formulated to comprehensively address the
distributed resource management problems in FL, including multi-objective
trade-off, client selection, and incentive mechanism. As the PDG is a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, a distributed
semi-heuristic algorithm with low computational complexity and low
communication overhead is designed to solve it. The simulation result verifies
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">As the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) becomes increasingly
prevalent, ensuring safe and smooth interactions between AVs and other human
agents is of critical importance. In the urban environment, how vehicles
resolve conflicts has significant impacts on both driving safety and traffic
efficiency. To expedite the studies on evaluating conflict resolution in
AV-involved and AV-free scenarios at intersections, this paper presents a
high-quality dataset derived from the open Argoverse-2 motion forecasting data.
First, scenarios of interest are selected by applying a set of heuristic rules
regarding post-encroachment time (PET), minimum distance, trajectory crossing,
and speed variation. Next, the quality of the raw data is carefully examined.
We found that position and speed data are not consistent in Argoverse-2 data
and its improper processing induced unnecessary errors. To address these
specific problems, we propose and apply a data processing pipeline to correct
and enhance the raw data. As a result, 5k+ AV-involved scenarios and 16k+
AV-free scenarios with smooth and consistent position, speed, acceleration, and
heading direction data are obtained. Further assessments show that this dataset
comprises diverse and balanced conflict resolution regimes. This informative
dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the
field of autonomous vehicle assessment and regulation. The dataset is openly
available via https://github.com/RomainLITUD/conflict_resolution_dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Reduced order models (ROMs) are widely used in scientific computing to tackle
high-dimensional systems. However, traditional ROM methods may only partially
capture the intrinsic geometric characteristics of the data. These
characteristics encompass the underlying structure, relationships, and
essential features crucial for accurate modeling.
<br />To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel ROM framework that integrates
optimal transport (OT) theory and neural network-based methods. Specifically,
we investigate the Kernel Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (kPOD) method
exploiting the Wasserstein distance as the custom kernel, and we efficiently
train the resulting neural network (NN) employing the Sinkhorn algorithm. By
leveraging an OT-based nonlinear reduction, the presented framework can capture
the geometric structure of the data, which is crucial for accurate learning of
the reduced solution manifold. When compared with traditional metrics such as
mean squared error or cross-entropy, exploiting the Sinkhorn divergence as the
loss function enhances stability during training, robustness against
overfitting and noise, and accelerates convergence.
<br />To showcase the approach's effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a set of
challenging test cases exhibiting a slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width. The
results show that our framework outperforms traditional ROM methods in terms of
accuracy and computational efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">How can online communities execute a focused vision for their space? Curation
offers one approach, where community leaders manually select content to share
with the community. Curation enables leaders to shape a space that matches
their taste, norms, and values, but the practice is often intractable at social
media scale: curators cannot realistically sift through hundreds or thousands
of submissions daily. In this paper, we contribute algorithmic and interface
foundations enabling curation at scale, and manifest these foundations in a
system called Cura. Our approach draws on the observation that, while curators'
attention is limited, other community members' upvotes are plentiful and
informative of curators' likely opinions. We thus contribute a
transformer-based curation model that predicts whether each curator will upvote
a post based on previous community upvotes. Cura applies this curation model to
create a feed of content that it predicts the curator would want in the
community. Evaluations demonstrate that the curation model accurately estimates
opinions of diverse curators, that changing curators for a community results in
clearly recognizable shifts in the community's content, and that, consequently,
curation can reduce anti-social behavior by half without extra moderation
effort. By sampling different types of curators, Cura lowers the threshold to
genres of curated social media ranging from editorial groups to stakeholder
roundtables to democracies.

<p class="mathjax">Math word problems (MWPs) require analyzing text descriptions and generating
mathematical equations to derive solutions. Existing works focus on solving
MWPs with two types of solvers: tree-based solver and large language model
(LLM) solver. However, these approaches always solve MWPs by a single solver,
which will bring the following problems: (1) Single type of solver is hard to
solve all types of MWPs well. (2) A single solver will result in poor
performance due to over-fitting. To address these challenges, this paper
utilizes multiple ensemble approaches to improve MWP-solving ability. Firstly,
We propose a problem type classifier that combines the strengths of the
tree-based solver and the LLM solver. This ensemble approach leverages their
respective advantages and broadens the range of MWPs that can be solved.
Furthermore, we also apply ensemble techniques to both tree-based solver and
LLM solver to improve their performance. For the tree-based solver, we propose
an ensemble learning framework based on ten-fold cross-validation and voting
mechanism. In the LLM solver, we adopt self-consistency (SC) method to improve

<p class="mathjax">As a promising paradigm federated Learning (FL) is widely used in
privacy-preserving machine learning, which allows distributed devices to
collaboratively train a model while avoiding data transmission among clients.
Despite its immense potential, the FL suffers from bottlenecks in training
speed due to client heterogeneity, leading to escalated training latency and
straggling server aggregation. To deal with this challenge, a novel split
federated learning (SFL) framework that pairs clients with different
computational resources is proposed, where clients are paired based on
computing resources and communication rates among clients, meanwhile the neural
network model is split into two parts at the logical level, and each client
only computes the part assigned to it by using the SL to achieve forward
inference and backward training. Moreover, to effectively deal with the client
pairing problem, a heuristic greedy algorithm is proposed by reconstructing the
optimization of training latency as a graph edge selection problem. Simulation
results show the proposed method can significantly improve the FL training
speed and achieve high performance both in independent identical distribution
(IID) and Non-IID data distribution.

<p class="mathjax">Programmers often seek help from Q\&amp;A websites to resolve issues they
encounter during programming. Stack Overflow has been a widely used platform
for this purpose for over a decade. Recently, revolutionary AI-powered
platforms like ChatGPT have quickly gained popularity among programmers for
their efficient and personalized programming assistance via natural language
interactions. Both platforms can offer valuable assistance to programmers, but
it's unclear which is more effective at enhancing programmer productivity. In
our paper, we conducted an exploratory user study to compare the performance of
Stack Overflow and ChatGPT in enhancing programmer productivity. Two groups of
students with similar programming abilities were instructed to use the two
platforms to solve three different types of programming tasks: algorithmic
challenges, library usage, and debugging. During the experiments, we measured
and compared the quality of code produced and the time taken to complete tasks
for the two groups. The results show that, concerning code quality, ChatGPT
outperforms Stack Overflow significantly in helping complete algorithmic and
library-related tasks, while Stack Overflow is better for debugging tasks.
Regarding task completion speed, the ChatGPT group is obviously faster than the
Stack Overflow group in the algorithmic challenge, but the two groups have a
similar performance in the other two tasks. Additionally, we conducted a
post-experiment survey with the participants to understand how the platforms
have helped them complete the programming tasks. We analyzed the questionnaires
to summarize ChatGPT and Stack Overflow's strengths and weaknesses pointed out
by the participants. By comparing these, we identified the reasons behind the
two platforms' divergent performances in programming assistance.

<p class="mathjax">Referring image segmentation aims to segment the target object referred by a
natural language expression. However, previous methods rely on the strong
assumption that one sentence must describe one target in the image, which is
often not the case in real-world applications. As a result, such methods fail
when the expressions refer to either no objects or multiple objects. In this
paper, we address this issue from two perspectives. First, we propose a Dual
Multi-Modal Interaction (DMMI) Network, which contains two decoder branches and
enables information flow in two directions. In the text-to-image decoder, text
embedding is utilized to query the visual feature and localize the
corresponding target. Meanwhile, the image-to-text decoder is implemented to
reconstruct the erased entity-phrase conditioned on the visual feature. In this
way, visual features are encouraged to contain the critical semantic
information about target entity, which supports the accurate segmentation in
the text-to-image decoder in turn. Secondly, we collect a new challenging but
realistic dataset called Ref-ZOM, which includes image-text pairs under
different settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, and the Ref-ZOM-trained
model performs well on various types of text inputs. Codes and datasets are
available at https://github.com/toggle1995/RIS-DMMI.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for joint gaze location
detection (GL-D) and gaze object detection (GO-D), \emph{i.e.}, gaze following
detection. Current approaches frame GL-D and GO-D as two separate tasks,
employing a multi-stage framework where human head crops must first be detected
and then be fed into a subsequent GL-D sub-network, which is further followed
by an additional object detector for GO-D. In contrast, we reframe the gaze
following detection task as detecting human head locations and their gaze
followings simultaneously, aiming at jointly detect human gaze location and
gaze object in a unified and single-stage pipeline. To this end, we propose
GTR, short for \underline{G}aze following detection \underline{TR}ansformer,
streamlining the gaze following detection pipeline by eliminating all
additional components, leading to the first unified paradigm that unites GL-D
and GO-D in a fully end-to-end manner. GTR enables an iterative interaction
between holistic semantics and human head features through a hierarchical
structure, inferring the relations of salient objects and human gaze from the
global image context and resulting in an impressive accuracy. Concretely, GTR
achieves a 12.1 mAP gain ($\mathbf{25.1}\%$) on GazeFollowing and a 18.2 mAP
gain ($\mathbf{43.3\%}$) on VideoAttentionTarget for GL-D, as well as a 19 mAP
improvement ($\mathbf{45.2\%}$) on GOO-Real for GO-D. Meanwhile, unlike
existing systems detecting gaze following sequentially due to the need for a
human head as input, GTR has the flexibility to comprehend any number of
people's gaze followings simultaneously, resulting in high efficiency.
Specifically, GTR introduces over a $\times 9$ improvement in FPS and the
relative gap becomes more pronounced as the human number grows.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a novel spatially non-stationary fading channel model is
proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with extremely-large
aperture service-array (ELAA). The proposed model incorporates three key
factors which cause the channel spatial non-stationarity: 1) link-wise
path-loss; 2) shadowing effect; 3) line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS state. With
appropriate parameter configurations, the proposed model can be used to
generate computer-simulated channel data that matches the published measurement
data from practical ELAA-MIMO channels. Given such appealing results, the
proposed fading channel model is employed to study the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of ELAA-MIMO channel capacity. For all of our studied scenarios,
it is unveiled that the ELAA-MIMO channel capacity obeys the skew-normal
distribution. Moreover, the channel capacity is also found close to the
Gaussian or Weibull distribution, depending on users' geo-location and
distribution. More specifically, for single-user equivalent scenarios or
multiuser scenarios with short user-to-ELAA distances (e.g., 1 m), the channel
capacity is close to the Gaussian distribution; and for others, it is close to
the Weibull distribution. Finally, the proposed channel model is also employed
to study the impact of channel spatial non-stationarity on linear MIMO
receivers through computer simulations. The proposed fading channel model is
available at https://github.com/ELAA-MIMO/non-stationary-fading-channel-model.

<p class="mathjax">Sample selection is a prevalent method in learning with noisy labels, where
small-loss data are typically considered as correctly labeled data. However,
this method may not effectively identify clean hard examples with large losses,
which are critical for achieving the model's close-to-optimal generalization
performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Late Stopping, which
leverages the intrinsic robust learning ability of DNNs through a prolonged
training process. Specifically, Late Stopping gradually shrinks the noisy
dataset by removing high-probability mislabeled examples while retaining the
majority of clean hard examples in the training set throughout the learning
process. We empirically observe that mislabeled and clean examples exhibit
differences in the number of epochs required for them to be consistently and
correctly classified, and thus high-probability mislabeled examples can be
removed. Experimental results on benchmark-simulated and real-world noisy
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has proved to be very effective in video action recognition.
Video violence recognition attempts to learn the human multi-dynamic behaviours
in more complex scenarios. In this work, we develop a method for video violence
recognition from a new perspective of skeleton points. Unlike the previous
works, we first formulate 3D skeleton point clouds from human skeleton
sequences extracted from videos and then perform interaction learning on these
3D skeleton point clouds. Specifically, we propose two types of Skeleton Points
Interaction Learning (SPIL) strategies: (i) Local-SPIL: by constructing a
specific weight distribution strategy between local regional points, Local-SPIL
aims to selectively focus on the most relevant parts of them based on their
features and spatial-temporal position information. In order to capture diverse
types of relation information, a multi-head mechanism is designed to aggregate
different features from independent heads to jointly handle different types of
relationships between points. (ii) Global-SPIL: to better learn and refine the
features of the unordered and unstructured skeleton points, Global-SPIL employs
the self-attention layer that operates directly on the sampled points, which
can help to make the output more permutation-invariant and well-suited for our
task. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
and show that our model outperforms the existing networks and achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on video violence datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Parallel architectures are continually increasing in performance and scale,
while underlying algorithmic infrastructure often fail to take full advantage
of available compute power. Within the context of MPI, irregular communication
patterns create bottlenecks in parallel applications. For instance, sparse
matrix operations, and applications which rely on them, are bottlenecked by
required sparse dynamic data exchanges. Assuming each process holds a subset of
rows of the sparse matrix and corresponding vector values, every process can
easily determine which values it must receive from other processes. However,
processes do not hold enough information to determine which values to send to
other processes. The process of forming this communication pattern requires
dynamic data exchanges. Current algorithms for sparse dynamic data exchanges
are bottlenecked by point-to-point communication constraints, particularly at
large scales. This paper presents a novel locality-aware sparse dynamic data
exchange which reduces the amount of costly communication, such as inter-node,
in exchange for additional less costly messages, reducing the cost and
improving scalability of the method.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, more and more research has focused on using Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) to solve the Graph Similarity Computation problem (GSC), i.e., computing
the Graph Edit Distance (GED) between two graphs. These methods treat GSC as an
end-to-end learnable task, and the core of their architecture is the feature
fusion modules to interact with the features of two graphs. Existing methods
consider that graph-level embedding is difficult to capture the differences in
local small structures between two graphs, and thus perform fine-grained
feature fusion on node-level embedding can improve the accuracy, but leads to
greater time and memory consumption in the training and inference phases.
However, this paper proposes a novel graph-level fusion module Different
Attention (DiffAtt), and demonstrates that graph-level fusion embeddings can
substantially outperform these complex node-level fusion embeddings. We posit
that the relative difference structure of the two graphs plays an important
role in calculating their GED values. To this end, DiffAtt uses the difference
between two graph-level embeddings as an attentional mechanism to capture the
graph structural difference of the two graphs. Based on DiffAtt, a new GSC
method, named Graph Edit Distance Learning via Different Attention (REDRAFT),
is proposed, and experimental results demonstrate that REDRAFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance in 23 out of 25 metrics in five benchmark
datasets. Especially on MSE, it respectively outperforms the second best by
19.9%, 48.8%, 29.1%, 31.6%, and 2.2%. Moreover, we propose a quantitative test
Remaining Subgraph Alignment Test (RESAT) to verify that among all graph-level
fusion modules, the fusion embedding generated by DiffAtt can best capture the
structural differences between two graphs.

from the computer vision community in the past decades. Moreover, HPE has been
applied to various domains, such as human-computer interaction, sports
analysis, and human tracking via images and videos. Recently, deep
learning-based approaches have shown state-of-the-art performance in HPE-based
applications. Although deep learning-based approaches have achieved remarkable
performance in HPE, a comprehensive review of deep learning-based HPE methods
remains lacking in the literature. In this article, we provide an up-to-date
and in-depth overview of the deep learning approaches in vision-based HPE. We
summarize these methods of 2-D and 3-D HPE, and their applications, discuss the
challenges and the research trends through bibliometrics, and provide
insightful recommendations for future research. This article provides a
meaningful overview as introductory material for beginners to deep
learning-based HPE, as well as supplementary material for advanced researchers.

conducts an extensive literature review to develop a conceptual framework for
the Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) phase for cubic facilities. The conceptual
framework takes into account the increasingly popular Internet of Things (IoT)

<p class="mathjax">Software systems continuously evolve due to new functionalities,
requirements, or maintenance activities. In the context of software evolution,
software refactoring has gained a strategic relevance. The space of possible
software refactoring is usually very large, as it is given by the combinations
of different refactoring actions that can produce software system alternatives.
Multi-objective algorithms have shown the ability to discover alternatives by
pursuing different objectives simultaneously. Performance of such algorithms in
the context of software model refactoring is of paramount importance.
Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a performance analysis of three genetic
algorithms to compare them in terms of performance and quality of solutions.
Our results show that there are significant differences in performance among
the algorithms (e.g., PESA2 seems to be the fastest one, while NSGA-II shows
the least memory usage).

<p class="mathjax">Multiclass classification is a fundamental and challenging task in machine
learning. The existing techniques of multiclass classification can be
categorized as (i) decomposition into binary (ii) extension from binary and
(iii) hierarchical classification. Decomposing multiclass classification into a
set of binary classifications that can be efficiently solved by using binary
classifiers, called class binarization, which is a popular technique for
multiclass classification. Neuroevolution, a general and powerful technique for
evolving the structure and weights of neural networks, has been successfully
applied to binary classification. In this paper, we apply class binarization
techniques to a neuroevolution algorithm, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT), that is used to generate neural networks for multiclass
classification. We propose a new method that applies Error-Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) to design the class binarization strategies on the neuroevolution
for multiclass classification. The ECOC strategies are compared with the class
binarization strategies of One-vs-One and One-vs-All on three well-known
datasets Digit, Satellite, and Ecoli. We analyse their performance from four
aspects of multiclass classification degradation, accuracy, evolutionary
efficiency, and robustness. The results show that the NEAT with ECOC performs
high accuracy with low variance. Specifically, it shows significant benefits in
a flexible number of binary classifiers and strong robustness.

Generation and Evaluation of Non-verbal Behavior for Embodied Agents (GENEA)
Challenge 2023, which aims to foster the development of realistic, automated
systems for generating conversational gestures. Participants are provided with
a pre-processed dataset and their systems are evaluated through crowdsourced
scoring. Our proposed model, DiffuseStyleGesture+, leverages a diffusion model
to generate gestures automatically. It incorporates a variety of modalities,
including audio, text, speaker ID, and seed gestures. These diverse modalities
are mapped to a hidden space and processed by a modified diffusion model to
produce the corresponding gesture for a given speech input. Upon evaluation,
the DiffuseStyleGesture+ demonstrated performance on par with the top-tier
models in the challenge, showing no significant differences with those models
in human-likeness, appropriateness for the interlocutor, and achieving
competitive performance with the best model on appropriateness for agent
speech. This indicates that our model is competitive and effective in
generating realistic and appropriate gestures for given speech. The code,

<p class="mathjax">We study a mechanism design problem in the blockchain proof-of-stake (PoS)
protocol. Our main objective is to extend the transaction fee mechanism (TFM)
recently proposed in Chung and Shi (SODA, p.3856-3899, 2023), so as to
incorporate a long-run utility model for the miner into the burning
second-price auction mechanism $\texttt{BSP}(\gamma)$ proposed in Chung and Shi
(where $\gamma$ is a key parameter in the strict $\gamma$-utility model that is
applied to both miners and users). First, we derive an explicit functional form
for the long-run utility of the miner using a martingale approach, and reveal a
critical discontinuity of the utility function, namely a small deviation from
being truthful will yield a discrete jump (up or down) in the miner's utility.
We show that because of this discontinuity the $\texttt{BSP}(\gamma)$ mechanism
will fail a key desired property in TFM, $c$-side contract proofness ($c$-SCP).
As a remedy, we introduce another parameter $\theta$, and propose a new
$\texttt{BSP}(\theta)$ mechanism, and prove that it satisfies all three desired
properties of TFM: user- and miner-incentive compatibility (UIC and MIC) as
well as $c$-SCP, provided the parameter $\theta$ falls into a specific range,
along with a proper tick size imposed on user bids.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we investigate the benefits of secondary user (SU) network
beamforming on improving primary user (PU) location privacy in spectrum sharing
systems, where the beamformer in the SU network is designed to suppress the
aggregate interference to improve the location privacy of PUs. We consider two
problems: improving SU network communication throughput subject to the
specified PU location privacy requirements, and enhancing PU location privacy
given the quality of service (QoS) requirements of SU networks. In the first
problem, we provide an algorithm to achieve high data rates with the
constrained PU location privacy level. Numerical results show that for a given
PU location privacy requirement, the proposed scheme is able to
interfere/exclude only a few SU nodes from the PU band and the network
throughput can be greatly improved. In the second problem, to fully explore the
potential of SU network beamforming for enhancing PU location privacy, we
propose a two-step scheme to decouple the beamforming and privacy zone design
so that the PU location privacy can be improved while satisfying the SU network
throughput requirement. According to numerical evaluations, the proposed scheme
can maintain/achieve higher PU location privacy than the benchmark beamforming
schemes while satisfying a QoS requirement for the SU network.

<p class="mathjax">Face morphing is one of the seminal problems in computer graphics, with
numerous artistic and forensic applications. It is notoriously challenging due
to pose, lighting, gender, and ethnicity variations. Generally, this task
consists of a warping for feature alignment and a blending for a seamless
transition between the warped images.
<br />We propose to leverage coordinate-based neural networks to represent such
warpings and blendings of face images. During training, we exploit the
smoothness and flexibility of such networks, by combining energy functionals
employed in classical approaches without discretizations. Additionally, our
method is time-dependent, allowing a continuous warping, and blending of the
target images.
<br />During warping inference, we need both direct and inverse transformations of
the time-dependent warping. The first is responsible for morphing the target
image into the source image, while the inverse is used for morphing in the
opposite direction. Our neural warping stores those maps in a single network
due to its inversible property, dismissing the hard task of inverting them.
<br />The results of our experiments indicate that our method is competitive with
both classical and data-based neural techniques under the lens of face-morphing
detection approaches. Aesthetically, the resulting images present a seamless
blending of diverse faces not yet usual in the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Suppose we are given an $n$-node, $m$-edge input graph $G$, and the goal is
to compute a spanning subgraph $H$ on $O(n)$ edges. This can be achieved in
linear $O(m + n)$ time via breadth-first search. But can we hope for
\emph{sublinear} runtime in some range of parameters?
<br />If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency list, there are simple lower
bounds showing that $\Omega(m + n)$ runtime is necessary. If the goal is to
return $H$ as an adjacency matrix, then we need $\Omega(n^2)$ time just to
write down the entries of the output matrix. However, we show that neither of
these lower bounds still apply if instead the goal is to return $H$ as an
\emph{implicit} adjacency matrix, which we call an \emph{adjacency oracle}. An
adjacency oracle is a data structure that gives a user the illusion that an
adjacency matrix has been computed: it accepts edge queries $(u, v)$, and it
returns in near-constant time a bit indicating whether $(u, v) \in E(H)$.
<br />Our main result is that one can construct an adjacency oracle for a spanning
subgraph on at most $(1+\varepsilon)n$ edges, in $\tilde{O}(n
\varepsilon^{-1})$ time, and that this construction time is near-optimal.
Additional results include constructions of adjacency oracles for
$k$-connectivity certificates and spanners, which are similarly sublinear on
dense-enough input graphs.
<br />Our adjacency oracles are closely related to Local Computation Algorithms
(LCAs) for graph sparsifiers; they can be viewed as LCAs with some computation
moved to a preprocessing step, in order to speed up queries. Our oracles imply
the first Local algorithm for computing sparse spanning subgraphs of general
input graphs in $\tilde{O}(n)$ query time, which works by constructing our
adjacency oracle, querying it once, and then throwing the rest of the oracle
away. This addresses an open problem of Rubinfeld [CSR '17].

<p class="mathjax">Polypharmacy, the concurrent use of multiple drugs to treat a single
condition, is common in patients managing multiple or complex conditions.
However, as more drugs are added to the treatment plan, the risk of adverse
drug events (ADEs) rises rapidly. Many serious ADEs associated with
polypharmacy only become known after the drugs are in use. It is impractical to
test every possible drug combination during clinical trials. This issue is
particularly prevalent among older adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD)
where polypharmacy and ADEs are commonly observed. In this research, our
primary objective was to identify key drug features to build and evaluate a
model for modeling polypharmacy ADEs. Our secondary objective was to assess our
model on a domain-specific case study. We developed a two-layer neural network
that incorporated drug features such as molecular structure, drug-protein
interactions, and mono drug side effects (DrIVeNN). We assessed DrIVeNN using
publicly available side effect databases and determined Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) with a variance threshold of 0.95 as the most effective feature
selection method. DrIVeNN performed moderately better than state-of-the-art
models like RESCAL, DEDICOM, DeepWalk, Decagon, DeepDDI, KGDDI, and KGNN in
terms of AUROC for the drug-drug interaction prediction task. We also conducted
a domain-specific case study centered on the treatment of cardiovascular
disease (CVD). When the best performing model architecture was applied to the
CVD treatment cohort, there was a significant increase in performance from the
general model. We observed an average AUROC for CVD drug pair prediction
increasing from 0.826 (general model) to 0.975 (CVD specific model). Our
findings indicate the strong potential of domain-specific models for improving
the accuracy of drug-drug interaction predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is quite challenging due to the large
distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain.
Inspired by diffusion models which have strong capability to gradually convert
data distributions across a large gap, we consider to explore the diffusion
technique to handle the challenging UDA task. However, using diffusion models
to convert data distribution across different domains is a non-trivial problem
as the standard diffusion models generally perform conversion from the Gaussian
distribution instead of from a specific domain distribution. Besides, during
the conversion, the semantics of the source-domain data needs to be preserved
for classification in the target domain. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Domain-Adaptive Diffusion (DAD) module accompanied by a Mutual Learning
Strategy (MLS), which can gradually convert data distribution from the source
domain to the target domain while enabling the classification model to learn
along the domain transition process. Consequently, our method successfully
eases the challenge of UDA by decomposing the large domain gap into small ones
and gradually enhancing the capacity of classification model to finally adapt
to the target domain. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-arts by a
large margin on three widely used UDA datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of mobile
intelligence. Federated Learning (FL), a method to preserve user data privacy,
is often employed in fine-tuning LLMs to downstream mobile tasks, an approach
known as FedLLM. Though recent efforts have addressed the network issue induced
by the vast model size, they have not practically mitigated vital challenges
concerning integration with mobile devices, such as significant memory
consumption and sluggish model convergence.
<br />In response to these challenges, this work introduces FwdLLM, an innovative
FL protocol designed to enhance the FedLLM efficiency. The key idea of FwdLLM
to employ backpropagation (BP)-free training methods, requiring devices only to
execute ``perturbed inferences''. Consequently, FwdLLM delivers way better
memory efficiency and time efficiency (expedited by mobile NPUs and an expanded
array of participant devices). FwdLLM centers around three key designs: (1) it
combines BP-free training with parameter-efficient training methods, an
essential way to scale the approach to the LLM era; (2) it systematically and
adaptively allocates computational loads across devices, striking a careful
balance between convergence speed and accuracy; (3) it discriminatively samples
perturbed predictions that are more valuable to model convergence.
Comprehensive experiments with five LLMs and three NLP tasks illustrate
FwdLLM's significant advantages over conventional methods, including up to
three orders of magnitude faster convergence and a 14.6x reduction in memory

<p class="mathjax">Generalizing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to new scenes is a significant
challenge that existing approaches struggle to address without extensive
modifications to vanilla NeRF framework. We introduce InsertNeRF, a method for
INStilling gEneRalizabiliTy into NeRF. By utilizing multiple plug-and-play
HyperNet modules, InsertNeRF dynamically tailors NeRF's weights to specific
reference scenes, transforming multi-scale sampling-aware features into
scene-specific representations. This novel design allows for more accurate and
efficient representations of complex appearances and geometries. Experiments
show that this method not only achieves superior generalization performance but
also provides a flexible pathway for integration with other NeRF-like systems,
even in sparse input settings. Code will be available

<p class="mathjax">Memory-aware network scheduling is becoming increasingly important for deep
neural network (DNN) inference on resource-constrained devices. However, due to
the complex cell-level and network-level topologies, memory-aware scheduling
becomes very challenging. While previous algorithms all suffer from poor
scalability, in this paper, we propose an efficient memory-aware scheduling
framework based on iterative computation graph optimization. Our framework
features an iterative graph fusion algorithm that simplifies the computation
graph while preserving the scheduling optimality. We further propose an integer
linear programming formulation together with topology-aware variable pruning to
schedule the simplified graph efficiently. We evaluate our method against
prior-art algorithms on different networks and demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing techniques in all the benchmarks, reducing the peak memory
footprint by 13.4%, and achieving better scalability for networks with complex
network-level topologies.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel confidence refinement scheme that enhances pseudo-labels
in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Unlike current leading methods, which
filter pixels with low-confidence predictions in isolation, our approach
leverages the spatial correlation of labels in segmentation maps by grouping
neighboring pixels and considering their pseudo-labels collectively. With this
contextual information, our method, named S4MC, increases the amount of
unlabeled data used during training while maintaining the quality of the
pseudo-labels, all with negligible computational overhead. Through extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that S4MC outperforms
existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches, offering a
promising solution for reducing the cost of acquiring dense annotations. For
example, S4MC achieves a 1.29 mIoU improvement over the prior state-of-the-art
method on PASCAL VOC 12 with 366 annotated images. The code to reproduce our
experiments is available at https://s4mcontext.github.io/

<p class="mathjax">Existing methods for 3D face reconstruction from a few casually captured
images employ deep learning based models along with a 3D Morphable Model(3DMM)
as face geometry prior. Structure From Motion(SFM), followed by Multi-View
Stereo (MVS), on the other hand, uses dozens of high-resolution images to
reconstruct accurate 3D faces.However, it produces noisy and stretched-out
results with only two views available. In this paper, taking inspiration from
both these methods, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that disjointly solves
for pose and shape to make the optimization stable and accurate. We use a face
shape prior to estimate face pose and use stereo matching followed by a 3DMM to
solve for the shape. The proposed method achieves end-to-end topological
consistency, enables iterative face pose refinement procedure, and show
remarkable improvement on both quantitative and qualitative results over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Prompt-tuning has emerged as an attractive paradigm for deploying large-scale
language models due to its strong downstream task performance and efficient
multitask serving ability. Despite its wide adoption, we empirically show that
prompt-tuning is vulnerable to downstream task-agnostic backdoors, which reside
in the pretrained models and can affect arbitrary downstream tasks. The
state-of-the-art backdoor detection approaches cannot defend against
task-agnostic backdoors since they hardly converge in reversing the backdoor
triggers. To address this issue, we propose LMSanitator, a novel approach for
detecting and removing task-agnostic backdoors on Transformer models. Instead
of directly inversing the triggers, LMSanitator aims to inverse the predefined
attack vectors (pretrained models' output when the input is embedded with
triggers) of the task-agnostic backdoors, which achieves much better
convergence performance and backdoor detection accuracy. LMSanitator further
leverages prompt-tuning's property of freezing the pretrained model to perform
accurate and fast output monitoring and input purging during the inference
phase. Extensive experiments on multiple language models and NLP tasks
illustrate the effectiveness of LMSanitator. For instance, LMSanitator achieves
92.8% backdoor detection accuracy on 960 models and decreases the attack
success rate to less than 1% in most scenarios.

perception for researchers, scientists, and the general populace. Once thought
to be unattainable, these technologies have achieved the seemingly impossible.
Their exceptional applications in diverse fields like security, agriculture,
and education are a testament to their impact. However, the full potential of
computer vision remains untapped. This paper explores computer vision's
potential in security and surveillance, presenting a novel approach to track
motion in videos. By categorizing motion into Arcs, Lanes,
Converging/Diverging, and Random/Block motions using Motion Information Images
and Blockwise dominant motion data, the paper examines different optical flow

<p class="mathjax">With the rise of foundation models, a new artificial intelligence paradigm
has emerged, by simply using general purpose foundation models with prompting
to solve problems instead of training a separate machine learning model for
each problem. Such models have been shown to have emergent properties of
solving problems that they were not initially trained on. The studies for the
effectiveness of such models are still quite limited. In this work, we widely
study the capabilities of the ChatGPT models, namely GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, on 13
affective computing problems, namely aspect extraction, aspect polarity
classification, opinion extraction, sentiment analysis, sentiment intensity
ranking, emotions intensity ranking, suicide tendency detection, toxicity
detection, well-being assessment, engagement measurement, personality
assessment, sarcasm detection, and subjectivity detection. We introduce a
framework to evaluate the ChatGPT models on regression-based problems, such as
intensity ranking problems, by modelling them as pairwise ranking
classification. We compare ChatGPT against more traditional NLP methods, such
as end-to-end recurrent neural networks and transformers. The results
demonstrate the emergent abilities of the ChatGPT models on a wide range of
affective computing problems, where GPT-3.5 and especially GPT-4 have shown
strong performance on many problems, particularly the ones related to
sentiment, emotions, or toxicity. The ChatGPT models fell short for problems
with implicit signals, such as engagement measurement and subjectivity
detection.

yet they frequently face the issue of incompleteness. In this study, we explore
utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) for knowledge graph completion. We
consider triples in knowledge graphs as text sequences and introduce an
innovative framework called Knowledge Graph LLM (KG-LLM) to model these
triples. Our technique employs entity and relation descriptions of a triple as
prompts and utilizes the response for predictions. Experiments on various
benchmark knowledge graphs demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art

also find that fine-tuning relatively smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-7B,

<p class="mathjax">Transfer learning improves the performance of deep learning models by
initializing them with parameters pre-trained on larger datasets. Intuitively,
transfer learning is more effective when pre-training is on the in-domain
datasets. A recent study by NASA has demonstrated that the microstructure
segmentation with encoder-decoder algorithms benefits more from CNN encoders
pre-trained on microscopy images than from those pre-trained on natural images.
However, CNN models only capture the local spatial relations in images. In
recent years, attention networks such as Transformers are increasingly used in
image analysis to capture the long-range relations between pixels. In this
study, we compare the segmentation performance of Transformer and CNN models
pre-trained on microscopy images with those pre-trained on natural images. Our
result partially confirms the NASA study that the segmentation performance of
out-of-distribution images (taken under different imaging and sample
conditions) is significantly improved when pre-training on microscopy images.
However, the performance gain for one-shot and few-shot learning is more modest
with Transformers. We also find that for image segmentation, the combination of
pre-trained Transformers and CNN encoders are consistently better than
pre-trained CNN encoders alone. Our dataset (of about 50,000 images) combines
the public portion of the NASA dataset with additional images we collected.
Even with much less training data, our pre-trained models have significantly
better performance for image segmentation. This result suggests that
Transformers and CNN complement each other and when pre-trained on microscopy
images, they are more beneficial to the downstream tasks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper launches a new effort at modeling programmer attention by
predicting eye movement scanpaths. Programmer attention refers to what
information people intake when performing programming tasks. Models of
programmer attention refer to machine prediction of what information is
important to people. Models of programmer attention are important because they
help researchers build better interfaces, assistive technologies, and more
human-like AI. For many years, researchers in SE have built these models based
on features such as mouse clicks, key logging, and IDE interactions. Yet the
holy grail in this area is scanpath prediction -- the prediction of the
sequence of eye fixations a person would take over a visual stimulus. A
person's eye movements are considered the most concrete evidence that a person
is taking in a piece of information. Scanpath prediction is a notoriously
difficult problem, but we believe that the emergence of lower-cost,
higher-accuracy eye tracking equipment and better large language models of
source code brings a solution within grasp. We present an eye tracking
experiment with 27 programmers and a prototype scanpath predictor to present
preliminary results and obtain early community feedback.

<p class="mathjax">This study aims to enhance data consistency in NoSQL databases, traditionally
designed with BASE properties, as opposed to the strong consistency guaranteed
by ACID principles in RDBMS. We introduce a comprehensive four-stage
server-side model engineered explicitly for MongoDB. This model covers
transaction management, bifurcation of read and write transactions, assessment
of transaction readiness, and transaction execution via a specialized locking
algorithm. Utilizing the Yahoo Cloud Services Benchmark (YCSB), particularly
for update-heavy workloads (A, B, and F), our model exhibited significant
improvements. Specifically, the average throughput, read, and update latencies
improved to 2864.726 ms, 32806.275 ms, and 51845.629 ms, respectively, from the
baseline metrics of 2914.110 ms, 26510.930 ms, and 32457.662 ms. These results
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in enhancing consistency not
only in document-based NoSQL databases like MongoDB but also in other NoSQL
database variants, including key-value, graph, and wide-column stores.

<p class="mathjax">Since introduced, Swin Transformer has achieved remarkable results in the
field of computer vision, it has sparked the need for dedicated hardware
accelerators, specifically catering to edge computing demands. For the
advantages of flexibility, low power consumption, FPGAs have been widely
employed to accelerate the inference of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and show potential in Transformer-based models. Unlike CNNs, which mainly
involve multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations, Transformer involve
non-linear computations such as Layer Normalization (LN), Softmax, and GELU.
These nonlinear computations do pose challenges for accelerator design. In this
paper, to propose an efficient FPGA-based hardware accelerator for Swin
Transformer, we focused on using different strategies to deal with these
nonlinear calculations and efficiently handling MAC computations to achieve the
best acceleration results. We replaced LN with BN, Given that Batch
Normalization (BN) can be fused with linear layers during inference to optimize
inference efficiency. The modified Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B respectively
achieved Top-1 accuracy rates of 80.7%, 82.7%, and 82.8% in ImageNet.
Furthermore, We employed strategies for approximate computation to design
hardware-friendly architectures for Softmax and GELU computations. We also
designed an efficient Matrix Multiplication Unit to handle all linear
computations in Swin Transformer. As a conclude, compared with CPU (AMD Ryzen
5700X), our accelerator achieved 1.76x, 1.66x, and 1.25x speedup and achieved
20.45x, 18.60x, and 14.63x energy efficiency (FPS/power consumption)
improvement on Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B models, respectively. Compared to GPU
(Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti), we achieved 5.05x, 4.42x, and 3.00x energy efficiency
improvement respectively. As far as we know, the accelerator we proposed is the
fastest FPGA-based accelerator for Swin Transformer.

<p class="mathjax">While paper instructions are one of the mainstream medium for sharing
knowledge, consuming such instructions and translating them into activities are
inefficient due to the lack of connectivity with physical environment. We
present PaperToPlace, a novel workflow comprising an authoring pipeline, which
allows the authors to rapidly transform and spatialize existing paper
instructions into MR experience, and a consumption pipeline, which
computationally place each instruction step at an optimal location that is easy
to read and do not occlude key interaction areas. Our evaluations of the
authoring pipeline with 12 participants demonstrated the usability of our
workflow and the effectiveness of using a machine learning based approach to
help extracting the spatial locations associated with each steps. A second
within-subject study with another 12 participants demonstrates the merits of
our consumption pipeline by reducing efforts of context switching, delivering
the segmented instruction steps and offering the hands-free affordances.

<p class="mathjax">Fake news has emerged as a pervasive problem within Online Social Networks,
leading to a surge of research interest in this area. Understanding the
dissemination mechanisms of fake news is crucial in comprehending the
propagation of disinformation/misinformation and its impact on users in Online
Social Networks. This knowledge can facilitate the development of interventions
to curtail the spread of false information and inform affected users to remain
vigilant against fraudulent/malicious content. In this paper, we specifically
target the Twitter platform and propose a Multivariate Hawkes Point Processes
model that incorporates essential factors such as user networks, response tweet
types, and user stances as model parameters. Our objective is to investigate
and quantify their influence on the dissemination process of fake news. We
derive parameter estimation expressions using an Expectation Maximization
algorithm and validate them on a simulated dataset. Furthermore, we conduct a
case study using a real dataset of fake news collected from Twitter to explore
the impact of user stances and tweet types on dissemination patterns. This
analysis provides valuable insights into how users are influenced by or
influence the dissemination process of disinformation/misinformation, and
demonstrates how our model can aid in intervening in this process.

<p class="mathjax">Teleoperation enables a user to perform tasks from a remote location. Hence,
the user can interact with a long-distance environment through the operation of
a robotic system. Often, teleoperation is required in order to perform
dangerous tasks (e.g., work in disaster zones or in chemical plants) while
keeping the user out of harm's way. Nevertheless, common approaches often
provide cumbersome and unnatural usage. In this letter, we propose TeleFMG, an
approach for teleoperation of a multi-finger robotic hand through natural
motions of the user's hand. By using a low-cost wearable Force-Myography (FMG)
device, musculoskeletal activities on the user's forearm are mapped to hand
poses which, in turn, are mimicked by a robotic hand. The mapping is performed
by a data-based model that considers spatial positions of the sensors on the
forearm along with temporal dependencies of the FMG signals. A set of
experiments show the ability of a teleoperator to control a multi-finger hand
through intuitive and natural finger motion. Furthermore, transfer to new users
is demonstrated.

<p class="mathjax">Neural implicit representations are known to be more compact for depicting 3D
shapes than traditional discrete representations. However, the neural
representations tend to round sharp corners or edges and struggle to represent
surfaces with open boundaries. Moreover, they are slow to train. We present a
unified neural implicit representation, called Patch-Grid, that fits to complex
shapes efficiently, preserves sharp features, and effectively models surfaces
with open boundaries and thin geometric features. Our superior efficiency comes
from embedding each surface patch into a local latent volume and decoding it
using a shared MLP decoder, which is pretrained on various local surface
geometries. With this pretrained decoder fixed, fitting novel shapes and local
shape updates can be done efficiently. The faithful preservation of sharp
features is enabled by adopting a novel merge grid to perform local
constructive solid geometry (CSG) combinations of surface patches in the cells
of an adaptive Octree, yielding better robustness than using a global CSG
construction as proposed in the literature. Experiments show that our
Patch-Grid method faithfully captures shapes with complex sharp features, open
boundaries and thin structures, and outperforms existing learning-based methods
in both efficiency and quality for surface fitting and local shape updates.

<p class="mathjax">Many tasks performed by two humans require mutual interaction between arms
such as handing-over tools and objects. In order for a robotic arm to interact
with a human in the same way, it must reason about the location of the human
arm in real-time. Furthermore and to acquire interaction in a timely manner,
the robot must be able predict the final target of the human in order to plan
and initiate motion beforehand. In this paper, we explore the use of a low-cost
wearable device equipped with two inertial measurement units (IMU) for learning
reaching motion for real-time applications of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC).
A wearable device can replace or be complementary to visual perception in cases
of bad lighting or occlusions in a cluttered environment. We first train a
neural-network model to estimate the current location of the arm. Then, we
propose a novel model based on a recurrent neural-network to predict the future
target of the human arm during motion in real-time. Early prediction of the
target grants the robot with sufficient time to plan and initiate motion during
the motion of the human. The accuracies of the models are analyzed concerning
the features included in the motion representation. Through experiments and
real demonstrations with a robotic arm, we show that sufficient accuracy is
achieved for feasible HRC without any visual perception. Once trained, the
system can be deployed in various spaces with no additional effort. The models
exhibit high accuracy for various initial poses of the human arm. Moreover, the
trained models are shown to provide high success rates with additional human
participants not included in the model training.

<p class="mathjax">Adapting the User Interface (UI) of software systems to user requirements and
the context of use is challenging. The main difficulty consists of suggesting
the right adaptation at the right time in the right place in order to make it
valuable for end-users. We believe that recent progress in Machine Learning
techniques provides useful ways in which to support adaptation more
effectively. In particular, Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to
personalise interfaces for each context of use in order to improve the user
experience (UX). However, determining the reward of each adaptation alternative
is a challenge in RL for UI adaptation. Recent research has explored the use of
reward models to address this challenge, but there is currently no empirical
evidence on this type of model. In this paper, we propose a confirmatory study
design that aims to investigate the effectiveness of two different approaches
for the generation of reward models in the context of UI adaptation using RL:
(1) by employing a reward model derived exclusively from predictive
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) models (HCI), and (2) by employing predictive
HCI models augmented by Human Feedback (HCI&amp;HF). The controlled experiment will
use an AB/BA crossover design with two treatments: HCI and HCI&amp;HF. We shall
determine how the manipulation of these two treatments will affect the UX when
interacting with adaptive user interfaces (AUI). The UX will be measured in
terms of user engagement and user satisfaction, which will be operationalized
by means of predictive HCI models and the Questionnaire for User Interaction
Satisfaction (QUIS), respectively. By comparing the performance of two reward
models in terms of their ability to adapt to user preferences with the purpose
of improving the UX, our study contributes to the understanding of how reward
modelling can facilitate UI adaptation using RL.

<p class="mathjax">Control barrier functions-based quadratic programming (CBF-QP) is gaining
popularity as an effective controller synthesis tool for safe control. However,
the provable safety is established on an accurate dynamic model and access to
all states. To address such a limitation, this paper proposes a novel design
combining an extended state observer (ESO) with a CBF for safe control of a
system with model uncertainty and external disturbances only using output
measurement. Our approach provides a less conservative estimation error bound
than other disturbance observer-based CBFs. Moreover, only output measurements
are needed to estimate the disturbances instead of access to the full state.
The bounds of state estimation error and disturbance estimation error are
obtained in a unified manner and then used for robust safe control under
uncertainty. We validate our approach's efficacy in simulations of an adaptive
cruise control system and a Segway self-balancing scooter.

<p class="mathjax">Kinodynamic motion planners allow robots to perform complex manipulation
tasks under dynamics constraints or with black-box models. However, they
struggle to find high-quality solutions, especially when a steering function is
unavailable. This paper presents a novel approach that adaptively biases the
sampling distribution to improve the planner's performance. The key
contribution is to formulate the sampling bias problem as a non-stationary
multi-armed bandit problem, where the arms of the bandit correspond to sets of
possible transitions. High-reward regions are identified by clustering
transitions from sequential runs of kinodynamic RRT and a bandit algorithm
decides what region to sample at each timestep. The paper demonstrates the
approach on several simulated examples as well as a 7-degree-of-freedom
manipulation task with dynamics uncertainty, suggesting that the approach finds
better solutions faster and leads to a higher success rate in execution.

<p class="mathjax">In our lives, we encounter various stressors that may cause negative mental
and bodily reactions to make us feel frustrated, angry, or irritated. Effective
methods to manage or reduce stress and anxiety are essential for a healthy
life, and several stress-management approaches are found to be useful for
stress relief, such as meditation, taking a rest, walking around nature, or
even breaking things in a smash room. Previous research has revealed that
certain experiences in virtual reality (VR) are effective for reducing stress
as traditional real-world methods. However, it is still unclear how the stress
relief effects are associated with other factors like individual user profile
in terms of different treatment activities. In this paper, we report our
findings from a formal user study that investigates the effects of two virtual
activities: (1) VR Meditation and (2) VR Smash Room experience, compared with a
traditional Sitting-in-Silence method. Our results show that VR Meditation has
a better stress relief effect compared to VR Smash Room and Sitting-in-Silence,
and the effects of the treatments are correlated with the participants'
personalities. We discuss the findings and implications addressing potential
benefits/impacts of different stress-relief activities in VR.

<p class="mathjax">Domain adaptation methods for 2D human pose estimation typically require
continuous access to the source data during adaptation, which can be
challenging due to privacy, memory, or computational constraints. To address
this limitation, we focus on the task of source-free domain adaptation for pose
estimation, where a source model must adapt to a new target domain using only
unlabeled target data. Although recent advances have introduced source-free
methods for classification tasks, extending them to the regression task of pose
estimation is non-trivial. In this paper, we present Prior-guided Self-training
(POST), a pseudo-labeling approach that builds on the popular Mean Teacher
framework to compensate for the distribution shift. POST leverages
prediction-level and feature-level consistency between a student and teacher
model against certain image transformations. In the absence of source data,
POST utilizes a human pose prior that regularizes the adaptation process by
directing the model to generate more accurate and anatomically plausible pose
pseudo-labels. Despite being simple and intuitive, our framework can deliver
significant performance gains compared to applying the source model directly to
the target data, as demonstrated in our extensive experiments and ablation
studies. In fact, our approach achieves comparable performance to recent
state-of-the-art methods that use source data for adaptation.

the Corsi block-tapping Task, a psychological test for assessing visuo-spatial
working memory. Our study results show that Walking supports spatial memory
best, and Grab follows. Though Teleportation is found to support it the least,

<p class="mathjax">One of the major drawbacks of deep learning models for computer vision has
been their inability to retain multiple sources of information in a modular
fashion. For instance, given a network that has been trained on a source task,
we would like to re-train this network on a similar, yet different, target task
while maintaining its performance on the source task. Simultaneously,
researchers have extensively studied modularization of network weights to
localize and identify the set of weights culpable for eliciting the observed
performance on a given task. One set of works studies the modularization
induced in the weights of a neural network by learning and analysing weight
masks. In this work, we combine these fields to study three such weight masking
methods and analyse their ability to mitigate "forgetting'' on the source task
while also allowing for efficient finetuning on the target task. We find that
different masking techniques have trade-offs in retaining knowledge in the
source task without adversely affecting target task performance.

to significant advancements in natural language processing. However, these
models are computationally expensive, necessitating model compression
techniques that reduce their size and complexity while maintaining accuracy.
This project investigates and applies knowledge distillation for BERT model
compression, specifically focusing on the TinyBERT student model. We explore
various techniques to improve knowledge distillation, including experimentation
with loss functions, transformer layer mapping methods, and tuning the weights
of attention and representation loss and evaluate our proposed techniques on a

<p class="mathjax">The sparse modeling is an evident manifestation capturing the parsimony
principle just described, and sparse models are widespread in statistics,
physics, information sciences, neuroscience, computational mathematics, and so
on. In statistics the many applications of sparse modeling span regression,
classification tasks, graphical model selection, sparse M-estimators and sparse
dimensionality reduction. It is also particularly effective in many statistical
and machine learning areas where the primary goal is to discover predictive
patterns from data which would enhance our understanding and control of
underlying physical, biological, and other natural processes, beyond just
building accurate outcome black-box predictors. Common examples include
selecting biomarkers in biological procedures, finding relevant brain activity
locations which are predictive about brain states and processes based on fMRI
data, and identifying network bottlenecks best explaining end-to-end
performance. Moreover, the research and applications of efficient recovery of
high-dimensional sparse signals from a relatively small number of observations,
which is the main focus of compressed sensing or compressive sensing, have
rapidly grown and became an extremely intense area of study beyond classical
signal processing. Likewise interestingly, sparse modeling is directly related
to various artificial vision tasks, such as image denoising, segmentation,
restoration and superresolution, object or face detection and recognition in
visual scenes, and action recognition.
<br />In this manuscript, we provide a brief introduction of the basic theory
underlying sparse representation and compressive sensing, and then discuss some
methods for recovering sparse solutions to optimization problems in effective
way, together with some applications of sparse recovery in a machine learning
problem known as sparse dictionary learning.

<p class="mathjax">To translate well, machine translation (MT) systems and general-purposed
language models (LMs) need a deep understanding of both source and target
languages and cultures. Therefore, idioms, with their non-compositional nature,
pose particular challenges for Transformer-based systems, as literal
translations often miss the intended meaning. Traditional methods, which
replace idioms using existing knowledge bases (KBs), often lack scale and
context awareness. Addressing these challenges, our approach prioritizes
context awareness and scalability, allowing for offline storage of idioms in a
manageable KB size. This ensures efficient serving with smaller models and
provides a more comprehensive understanding of idiomatic expressions. We
introduce a multilingual idiom KB (IdiomKB) developed using large LMs to
address this. This KB facilitates better translation by smaller models, such as
BLOOMZ (7.1B), Alpaca (7B), and InstructGPT (6.7B), by retrieving idioms'
figurative meanings. We present a novel, GPT-4-powered metric for human-aligned
evaluation, demonstrating that IdiomKB considerably boosts model performance.
Human evaluations further validate our KB's quality.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) has made BigCloneBench popular for semantic clone
detection tools. However, BigCloneBench only has a few Java semantic clones. In
addition, due to the design principles of how the benchmark was created,
imbalance issues have been identified, including the ambiguity in the
definition of semantic clones. Thus, ML-based clone detection algorithms
trained on BigCloneBench may overlook semantic clones or report incorrect
results. The SemanticCloneBench features Stack Overflow clones of several
languages. However, it lacks samples for ML-based clone detection. There is
also a marked lack of cross-language clone benchmarks. The widely used CLCDSA
dataset lacks reusable examples that can't be used in real-world software
systems, making it inadequate for ML-based clone detection. The OpenAI GPT-3
model has shown outstanding text production, including code generation and
summarization. In this paper, we used the GPT-3 model to generate a complete
benchmark for both semantic and cross-language clones. Using
SemanticCloneBench's genuine language clones, we tested several prompts to see
which yielded better results using GPT-3 question formulation. Then, we used
NiCad to filter Type-1 and Type-2 clones from GPT-3 output. We used a
GUI-assisted Clone Validator tool to manually validate all clone pairings with
nine judges. Functionality testing and CloneCognition verified our benchmark
has no syntactic clones. Later, we validated SourcererCC, Oreo and CLCDSA tools
on our benchmark. The poor performance of these tools suggests GPTCloneBench
has no syntactic clone. From 77,207 Clone pairs of SemanticCloneBench/GPT-3
output, we created a benchmark with 37,149 genuine semantic clone pairs, 19,288
false semantic pairs, and 20,770 cross-language clones across four languages
(Java, C, C#, and Python).

<p class="mathjax">Modern transformer-based models designed for computer vision have
outperformed humans across a spectrum of visual tasks. However, critical tasks,
such as medical image interpretation or autonomous driving, still require
reliance on human judgments. This work demonstrates how human visual input,
specifically fixations collected from an eye-tracking device, can be integrated
into transformer models to improve accuracy across multiple driving situations
and datasets. First, we establish the significance of fixation regions in
left-right driving decisions, as observed in both human subjects and a Vision
Transformer (ViT). By comparing the similarity between human fixation maps and
ViT attention weights, we reveal the dynamics of overlap across individual
heads and layers. This overlap is exploited for model pruning without
compromising accuracy. Thereafter, we incorporate information from the driving
scene with fixation data, employing a "joint space-fixation" (JSF) attention
setup. Lastly, we propose a "fixation-attention intersection" (FAX) loss to
train the ViT model to attend to the same regions that humans fixated on. We
find that the ViT performance is improved in accuracy and number of training
epochs when using JSF and FAX. These results hold significant implications for
human-guided artificial intelligence.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a fast adaptive federated meta-learning (FAM)
framework for collaboratively learning a single global model, which can then be
personalized locally on individual clients. Federated learning enables multiple
clients to collaborate to train a model without sharing data. Clients with
insufficient data or data diversity participate in federated learning to learn
a model with superior performance. Nonetheless, learning suffers when data
distributions diverge. There is a need to learn a global model that can be
adapted using client's specific information to create personalised models on
clients is required. MRI data suffers from this problem, wherein, one, due to
data acquisition challenges, local data at a site is sufficient for training an
accurate model and two, there is a restriction of data sharing due to privacy
concerns and three, there is a need for personalization of a learnt shared
global model on account of domain shift across client sites. The global model
is sparse and captures the common features in the MRI. This skeleton network is
grown on each client to train a personalised model by learning additional
client-specific parameters from local data. Experimental results show that the
personalization process at each client quickly converges using a limited number
of epochs. The personalized client models outperformed the locally trained
models, demonstrating the efficacy of the FAM mechanism. Additionally, the
sparse parameter set to be communicated during federated learning drastically
reduced communication overhead, which makes the scheme viable for networks with
limited resources.

<p class="mathjax">This thesis enhances the autonomy of the M4 (Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot)
robot, designed for Mars and rescue missions. The research enables the robot to
autonomously select its locomotion mode and path in complex terrains. Focusing
on walking and flying modes, a Gazebo simulation, and custom
perception-navigations pipelines are developed. Leveraging deep learning, the
robot determines optimal mode transitions based on a 2.5D map. Additionally, an
energy efficient path planner based on 2.5D mapping is implemented and
validated in simulations. The contributions demonstrate scalability for future
mode integrations. The M4 robot showcases intelligent mode switching, efficient
navigation, and reduced energy consumption, bringing us closer to fully
autonomous multi-modal robots for exploration and rescue missions. This work
paves the way for future advancements in autonomous robotics, with the ultimate
vision of deploying the M4 robot for exploration and rescue tasks, making a
significant impact in the quest for intelligent and versatile robotic systems.

<p class="mathjax">Learning from corrupted labels is very common in real-world machine-learning
applications. Memorizing such noisy labels could affect the learning of the
model, leading to sub-optimal performances. In this work, we propose a novel
framework to learn robust machine-learning models from noisy labels. Through an
empirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar
predictions on clean examples, while the predictions on noisy examples vary
much more across different models. Motivated by this observation, we propose
\em denoising with cross-model agreement \em (DeCA) which aims to minimize the
KL-divergence between the true label distributions parameterized by two machine
learning models while maximizing the likelihood of data observation. We employ
the proposed DeCA on both the binary label scenario and the multiple label
scenario. For the binary label scenario, we select implicit feedback
recommendation as the downstream task and conduct experiments with four
state-of-the-art recommendation models on four datasets. For the multiple-label
scenario, the downstream application is image classification on two benchmark
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly improve the model performance compared with normal training and
other denoising methods on both binary and multiple-label scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a generic technique to
model various NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems in the form of binary
variables. The Hamiltonian function is often used to formulate QUBO problems
where it is used as the objective function in the context of optimization. In
this study, we investigate how reinforcement learning-based (RL) paradigms with
the presence of the Hamiltonian function can address combinatorial optimization
problems over graphs in QUBO formulations. We use Graph Neural Network (GNN) as
the message-passing architecture to convey the information among the nodes. We
have centered our discussion on QUBO formulated Max-Cut problem but the
intuitions can be extended to any QUBO supported canonical NP-Hard
combinatorial optimization problems. We mainly investigate three formulations,
Monty-Carlo Tree Search with GNN-based RL (MCTS-GNN), DQN with GNN-based RL,
and a generic GNN with attention-based RL (GRL). Our findings state that in the
RL-based paradigm, the Hamiltonian function-based optimization in QUBO
formulation brings model convergence and can be used as a generic reward
function. We also analyze and present the performance of our RL-based setups
through experimenting over graphs of different densities and compare them with
a simple GNN-based setup in the light of constraint violation, learning
stability and computation cost. As per one of our findings, all the
architectures provide a very comparable performance in sparse graphs as per the
number of constraint violation whreas MCTS-GNN gives the best performance. In
the similar criteria, the performance significantly starts to drop both for GRL
and simple GNN-based setups whereas MCTS-GNN and DQN shines. We also present
the corresponding mathematical formulations and in-depth discussion of the
observed characteristics during experimentations.

<p class="mathjax">Bloodstain pattern analysis plays a crucial role in crime scene
investigations by providing valuable information through the study of unique
blood patterns. Conventional image analysis methods, like Thresholding and
Contrast, impose stringent requirements on the image background and is
labor-intensive in the context of droplet image segmentation. The Segment
Anything Model (SAM), a recently proposed method for extensive image
recognition, is yet to be adequately assessed for its accuracy and efficiency
on bloodstain image segmentation. This paper explores the application of
pre-trained SAM and fine-tuned SAM on bloodstain image segmentation with
diverse image backgrounds. Experiment results indicate that both pre-trained
and fine-tuned SAM perform the bloodstain image segmentation task with
satisfactory accuracy and efficiency, while fine-tuned SAM achieves an overall
2.2\% accuracy improvement than pre-trained SAM and 4.70\% acceleration in
terms of speed for image recognition. Analysis of factors that influence
bloodstain recognition is carried out. This research demonstrates the potential
application of SAM on bloodstain image segmentation, showcasing the
effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence application in criminology research.

decoding noise. We prove that Kyber decoding noise can be bounded by a sphere.
This result shows the Kyber encoding problem is essentially a sphere packing in
a hypercube. Lattice codes are then constructed to ensure denser packing and a
lower decryption failure rate (DFR). Compared with the original Kyber encoder,
the communication cost is reduced by up to 32.6%, the DFR is reduced by a

<p class="mathjax">We address catastrophic forgetting issues in graph learning as incoming data
transits from one to another graph distribution. Whereas prior studies
primarily tackle one setting of graph continual learning such as incremental
node classification, we focus on a universal approach wherein each data point
in a task can be a node or a graph, and the task varies from node to graph
classification. We propose a novel method that enables graph neural networks to
excel in this universal setting. Our approach perseveres knowledge about past
tasks through a rehearsal mechanism that maintains local and global structure
consistency across the graphs. We benchmark our method against various
continual learning baselines in real-world graph datasets and achieve
significant improvement in average performance and forgetting across tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Compression technology is essential for efficient image transmission and
storage. With the rapid advances in deep learning, images are beginning to be
used for image recognition as well as for human vision. For this reason,
research has been conducted on image coding for image recognition, and this
field is called Image Coding for Machines (ICM). There are two main approaches
in ICM: the ROI-based approach and the task-loss-based approach. The former
approach has the problem of requiring an ROI-map as input in addition to the
input image. The latter approach has the problems of difficulty in learning the
task-loss, and lack of robustness because the specific image recognition model
is used to compute the loss function. To solve these problems, we propose an
image compression model that learns object regions. Our model does not require
additional information as input, such as an ROI-map, and does not use
task-loss. Therefore, it is possible to compress images for various image
recognition models. In the experiments, we demonstrate the versatility of the
proposed method by using three different image recognition models and three
different datasets. In addition, we verify the effectiveness of our model by
comparing it with previous methods.

<p class="mathjax">Linear scalarization, i.e., combining all loss functions by a weighted sum,
has been the default choice in the literature of multi-task learning (MTL)
since its inception. In recent years, there is a surge of interest in
developing Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) that treat MTL as a
multi-objective optimization problem. However, it remains open whether there is
a fundamental advantage of SMTOs over scalarization. In fact, heated debates
exist in the community comparing these two types of algorithms, mostly from an
empirical perspective. To approach the above question, in this paper, we
revisit scalarization from a theoretical perspective. We focus on linear MTL
models and study whether scalarization is capable of fully exploring the Pareto
front. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to recent works that claimed
empirical advantages of scalarization, scalarization is inherently incapable of
full exploration, especially for those Pareto optimal solutions that strike the
balanced trade-offs between multiple tasks. More concretely, when the model is
under-parametrized, we reveal a multi-surface structure of the feasible region
and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for full exploration. This
leads to the conclusion that scalarization is in general incapable of tracing
out the Pareto front. Our theoretical results partially answer the open
questions in Xin et al. (2021), and provide a more intuitive explanation on why
scalarization fails beyond non-convexity. We additionally perform experiments
on a real-world dataset using both scalarization and state-of-the-art SMTOs.
The experimental results not only corroborate our theoretical findings, but
also unveil the potential of SMTOs in finding balanced solutions, which cannot
be achieved by scalarization.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce LDL, a fast and robust algorithm that localizes a panorama to a
3D map using line segments. LDL focuses on the sparse structural information of
lines in the scene, which is robust to illumination changes and can potentially
enable efficient computation. While previous line-based localization approaches
tend to sacrifice accuracy or computation time, our method effectively observes
the holistic distribution of lines within panoramic images and 3D maps.
Specifically, LDL matches the distribution of lines with 2D and 3D line
distance functions, which are further decomposed along principal directions of
lines to increase the expressiveness. The distance functions provide coarse
pose estimates by comparing the distributional information, where the poses are
further optimized using conventional local feature matching. As our pipeline
solely leverages line geometry and local features, it does not require costly
additional training of line-specific features or correspondence matching.
Nevertheless, our method demonstrates robust performance on challenging
scenarios including object layout changes, illumination shifts, and large-scale
scenes, while exhibiting fast pose search terminating within a matter of
milliseconds. We thus expect our method to serve as a practical solution for
line-based localization, and complement the well-established point-based
paradigm. The code for LDL is available through the following link:

<p class="mathjax">To overcome difficulties in classifying large dimensionality data with a
large number of classes, we propose a novel approach called JLSPCADL. This
paper uses the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma to select the dimensionality of
a transformed space in which a discriminative dictionary can be learned for
signal classification. Rather than reducing dimensionality via random
projections, as is often done with JL, we use a projection transformation
matrix derived from Modified Supervised PC Analysis (M-SPCA) with the
JL-prescribed dimension.
<br />JLSPCADL provides a heuristic to deduce suitable distortion levels and the
corresponding Suitable Description Length (SDL) of dictionary atoms to derive
an optimal feature space and thus the SDL of dictionary atoms for better
classification. Unlike state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction-based
dictionary learning methods, a projection transformation matrix derived in a
single step from M-SPCA provides maximum feature-label consistency of the
transformed space while preserving the cluster structure of the original data.
Despite confusing pairs, the dictionary for the transformed space generates
discriminative sparse coefficients, with fewer training samples.
Experimentation demonstrates that JLSPCADL scales well with an increasing
number of classes and dimensionality. Improved label consistency of features
due to M-SPCA helps to classify better. Further, the complexity of training a
discriminative dictionary is significantly reduced by using SDL.
Experimentation on OCR and face recognition datasets shows relatively better
classification performance than other supervised dictionary learning
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the basic statistical problem of detecting truncation of the
uniform distribution on the Boolean hypercube by juntas. More concretely, we
give upper and lower bounds on the problem of distinguishing between i.i.d.
sample access to either (a) the uniform distribution over $\{0,1\}^n$, or (b)
the uniform distribution over $\{0,1\}^n$ conditioned on the satisfying
assignments of a $k$-junta $f: \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$.
<br />We show that (up to constant factors) $\min\{2^k + \log{n\choose k},
{2^{k/2}\log^{1/2}{n\choose k}}\}$ samples suffice for this task and also show
that a $\log{n\choose k}$ dependence on sample complexity is unavoidable. Our
results suggest that testing junta truncation requires learning the set of
relevant variables of the junta.

<p class="mathjax">Battery state of health (SOH), which informs the maximal available capacity
of the battery, is a key indicator of battery aging failure. Accurately
estimating battery SOH is a vital function of the battery management system
that remains to be addressed. In this study, a physics-informed Gaussian
process regression (GPR) model is developed for battery SOH estimation, with
the performance being systematically compared with that of different types of
features and machine learning (ML) methods. The method performance is validated
based on 58826 cycling data units of 118 cells. Experimental results show that
the physics-driven ML generally estimates more accurate SOH than other
non-physical features under different scenarios. The physical features-based
GPR predicts battery SOH with the errors being less than 1.1% based on 10 to 20
mins' relaxation data. And the high robustness and generalization capability of
the methodology is also validated against different ratios of training and test
data under unseen conditions. Results also highlight the more effective
capability of knowledge transfer between different types of batteries with the
physical features and GPR. This study demonstrates the excellence of physical
features in indicating the state evolution of complex systems, and the improved
indication performance of these features by combining a suitable ML method.

<p class="mathjax">This study develops a methodology by capturing both the battery aging state
and degradation rate for improved life prediction performance. The aging state
is indicated by six physical features of an equivalent circuit model that are
extracted from the voltage relaxation data. And the degradation rate is
captured by two features extracted from the differences between the voltage
relaxation curves within a moving window (for life prediction), or the
differences between the capacity vs. voltage curves at different cycles (for
life classification). Two machine learning models, which are constructed based
on Gaussian Processes, are used to describe the relationships between these
physical features and battery lifetimes for the life prediction and
classification, respectively. The methodology is validated with the aging data
of 74 battery cells of three different types. Experimental results show that
based on only 3-12 minutes' sampling data, the method with novel features
predicts accurate battery lifetimes, with the prediction accuracy improved by
up to 67.09% compared with the benchmark method. And the batteries are
classified into three groups (long, medium, and short) with an overall accuracy
larger than 90% based on only two adjacent cycles' information, enabling the
highly efficient regrouping of retired batteries.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past decade, deep learning models have exhibited considerable
advancements, reaching or even exceeding human-level performance in a range of
visual perception tasks. This remarkable progress has sparked interest in
applying deep networks to real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles,
mobile devices, robotics, and edge computing. However, the challenge remains
that state-of-the-art models usually demand significant computational
resources, leading to impractical power consumption, latency, or carbon
emissions in real-world scenarios. This trade-off between effectiveness and
efficiency has catalyzed the emergence of a new research focus: computationally
efficient deep learning, which strives to achieve satisfactory performance
while minimizing the computational cost during inference. This review offers an
extensive analysis of this rapidly evolving field by examining four key areas:
1) the development of static or dynamic light-weighted backbone models for the
efficient extraction of discriminative deep representations; 2) the specialized
network architectures or algorithms tailored for specific computer vision
tasks; 3) the techniques employed for compressing deep learning models; and 4)
the strategies for deploying efficient deep networks on hardware platforms.
Additionally, we provide a systematic discussion on the critical challenges
faced in this domain, such as network architecture design, training schemes,
practical efficiency, and more realistic model compression approaches, as well
as potential future research directions.

<p class="mathjax">The absolute depth values of surrounding environments provide crucial cues
for various assistive technologies, such as localization, navigation, and 3D
structure estimation. We propose that accurate depth estimated from panoramic
images can serve as a powerful and light-weight input for a wide range of
downstream tasks requiring 3D information. While panoramic images can easily
capture the surrounding context from commodity devices, the estimated depth
shares the limitations of conventional image-based depth estimation; the
performance deteriorates under large domain shifts and the absolute values are
still ambiguous to infer from 2D observations. By taking advantage of the
holistic view, we mitigate such effects in a self-supervised way and fine-tune
the network with geometric consistency during the test phase. Specifically, we
construct a 3D point cloud from the current depth prediction and project the
point cloud at various viewpoints or apply stretches on the current input image
to generate synthetic panoramas. Then we minimize the discrepancy of the 3D
structure estimated from synthetic images without collecting additional data.
We empirically evaluate our method in robot navigation and map-free
localization where our method shows large performance enhancements. Our
calibration method can therefore widen the applicability under various external
conditions, serving as a key component for practical panorama-based machine
vision systems.

<p class="mathjax">Digital processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures mitigate the memory wall
problem by facilitating parallel bitwise operations directly within memory.
Recent works have demonstrated their algorithmic potential for accelerating
data-intensive applications; however, there remains a significant gap in the
programming model and microarchitectural design. This is further exacerbated by
the emerging model of partitions, which significantly complicates control and
periphery. Therefore, inspired by NVIDIA CUDA, this paper provides an
end-to-end architectural integration of digital memristive PIM from an abstract
high-level C++ programming interface for vector operations to the low-level
microarchitecture.
<br />We begin by proposing an efficient microarchitecture and instruction set
architecture (ISA) that bridge the gap between the low-level control periphery
and an abstraction of PIM parallelism into warps and threads. We subsequently
propose a PIM compilation library that converts high-level C++ to ISA
instructions, and a PIM driver that translates ISA instructions into PIM
micro-operations. This drastically simplifies the development of PIM
applications and enables PIM integration within larger existing C++ CPU/GPU
programs for heterogeneous computing with significant ease.
<br />Lastly, we present an efficient GPU-accelerated simulator for the proposed
PIM microarchitecture. Although slower than a theoretical PIM chip, this
simulator provides an accessible platform for developers to start executing and
debugging PIM algorithms. To validate our approach, we implement
state-of-the-art matrix operations and FFT PIM-based algorithms as case
studies. These examples demonstrate drastically simplified development without
compromising performance, showing the potential and significance of CUDA-PIM.

<p class="mathjax">Image-text retrieval requires the system to bridge the heterogenous gap
between vision and language for accurate retrieval while keeping the network
lightweight-enough for efficient retrieval. Existing trade-off solutions mainly
study from the view of incorporating cross-modal interactions with the
independent-embedding framework or leveraging stronger pretrained encoders,
which still demand time-consuming similarity measurement or heavyweight model
structure in the retrieval stage. In this work, we propose an image-text
alignment module SelfAlign on top of the independent-embedding framework, which
improves the retrieval accuracy while maintains the retrieval efficiency
without extra supervision. SelfAlign contains two collaborative sub-modules
that force image-text alignment at both concept level and context level by
self-supervised contrastive learning. It does not require cross-modal embedding
interactions during training while maintaining independent image and text
encoders during retrieval. With comparable time cost, SelfAlign consistently
boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art non-pretraining independent-embedding
models respectively by 9.1%, 4.2% and 6.6% in terms of R@sum score on
Flickr30K, MSCOCO 1K and MS-COCO 5K datasets. The retrieval accuracy also
outperforms most existing interactive-embedding models with orders of magnitude
decrease in retrieval time. The source code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Real-time solutions to the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problems are
crucial for promptly containing the spread of misinformation. However,
achieving this goal is non-trivial, mainly because assessing the blocked
influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive
Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). Although several approaches have been proposed
to enhance efficiency, they still fail to achieve real-time solutions to IBM
problems of practical scales. This work presents a novel approach that enables
solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds.
The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model, called neural
influence estimator (NIE), as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs. To this
end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the
false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the
topology and inter-relationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked
influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems
defined on a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM
optimization algorithms such as the greedy algorithm. The experiments on 25 IBM
problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization
method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based
optimization method to achieve the same solution quality. Moreover, given a
real-time constraint of one minute, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems
with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of
magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based disease diagnosis applications are essential for accurate
diagnosis at various disease stages. However, using personal data exposes
traditional centralized learning systems to privacy concerns. On the other
hand, by positioning processing resources closer to the device and enabling
more effective data analyses, a distributed computing paradigm has the
potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis. Scalable architectures for data
analytics are also crucial in healthcare, where data analytics results must
have low latency and high dependability and reliability. This study proposes a
microservices-based approach for IoT data analytics systems to satisfy privacy
and performance requirements by arranging entities into fine-grained, loosely
connected, and reusable collections. Our approach relies on federated learning,
which can increase disease diagnosis accuracy while protecting data privacy.
Additionally, we employ transfer learning to obtain more efficient models.
Using more than 5800 chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection from a publicly
available dataset, we ran experiments to assess the effectiveness of our
approach. Our experiments reveal that our approach performs better in
identifying pneumonia than other cutting-edge technologies, demonstrating our
approach's promising potential detection performance.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot font generation is challenging, as it needs to capture the
fine-grained stroke styles from a limited set of reference glyphs, and then
transfer to other characters, which are expected to have similar styles.
However, due to the diversity and complexity of Chinese font styles, the
synthesized glyphs of existing methods usually exhibit visible artifacts, such
as missing details and distorted strokes. In this paper, we propose a
VQGAN-based framework (i.e., VQ-Font) to enhance glyph fidelity through token
prior refinement and structure-aware enhancement. Specifically, we pre-train a
VQGAN to encapsulate font token prior within a codebook. Subsequently, VQ-Font
refines the synthesized glyphs with the codebook to eliminate the domain gap
between synthesized and real-world strokes. Furthermore, our VQ-Font leverages
the inherent design of Chinese characters, where structure components such as
radicals and character components are combined in specific arrangements, to
recalibrate fine-grained styles based on references. This process improves the
matching and fusion of styles at the structure level. Both modules collaborate
to enhance the fidelity of the generated fonts. Experiments on a collected font
dataset show that our VQ-Font outperforms the competing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively, especially in generating challenging styles.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of modern wireless communications systems depends critically
on the quality of the available channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter and receiver. Several previous works have proposed concepts and
algorithms that help maintain high quality CSI even in the presence of high
mobility and channel aging, such as temporal prediction schemes that employ
neural networks. However, it is still unclear which neural network-based scheme
provides the best performance in terms of prediction quality, training
complexity and practical feasibility. To investigate such a question, this
paper first provides an overview of state-of-the-art neural networks applicable
to channel prediction and compares their performance in terms of prediction
quality. Next, a new comparative analysis is proposed for four promising neural
networks with different prediction horizons. The well-known tapped delay
channel model recommended by the Third Generation Partnership Program is used
for a standardized comparison among the neural networks. Based on this
comparative evaluation, the advantages and disadvantages of each neural network
are discussed and guidelines for selecting the best-suited neural network in
channel prediction applications are given.

<p class="mathjax">Conventional Domain Adaptation (DA) methods aim to learn domain-invariant
feature representations to improve the target adaptation performance. However,
we motivate that domain-specificity is equally important since in-domain
trained models hold crucial domain-specific properties that are beneficial for
adaptation. Hence, we propose to build a framework that supports
disentanglement and learning of domain-specific factors and task-specific
factors in a unified model. Motivated by the success of vision transformers in
several multi-modal vision problems, we find that queries could be leveraged to
extract the domain-specific factors. Hence, we propose a novel
Domain-specificity-inducing Transformer (DSiT) framework for disentangling and
learning both domain-specific and task-specific factors. To achieve
disentanglement, we propose to construct novel Domain-Representative Inputs
(DRI) with domain-specific information to train a domain classifier with a
novel domain token. We are the first to utilize vision transformers for domain
adaptation in a privacy-oriented source-free setting, and our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on single-source, multi-source, and multi-target
benchmarks

<p class="mathjax">Skeleton-based action recognition has recently made significant progress.
However, data imbalance is still a great challenge in real-world scenarios. The
performance of current action recognition algorithms declines sharply when
training data suffers from heavy class imbalance. The imbalanced data actually
degrades the representations learned by these methods and becomes the
bottleneck for action recognition. How to learn unbiased representations from
imbalanced action data is the key to long-tailed action recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel balanced representation learning method to address
the long-tailed problem in action recognition. Firstly, a spatial-temporal
action exploration strategy is presented to expand the sample space
effectively, generating more valuable samples in a rebalanced manner. Secondly,
we design a detached action-aware learning schedule to further mitigate the
bias in the representation space. The schedule detaches the representation
learning of tail classes from training and proposes an action-aware loss to
impose more effective constraints. Additionally, a skip-modal representation is
proposed to provide complementary structural information. The proposed method
is validated on four skeleton datasets, NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA,
and Kinetics. It not only achieves consistently large improvement compared to
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also demonstrates a superior
generalization capacity through extensive experiments. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation model
(TASTE), which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items
by matching their text representations. TASTE verbalizes items and user-item
interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize
user behaviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which
enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the
self-attention computations during encoding. Our experiments show that TASTE
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on widely used sequential
recommendation datasets. TASTE alleviates the cold start problem by
representing long-tail items using full-text modeling and bringing the benefits
of pretrained language models to recommendation systems. Our further analyses
illustrate that TASTE significantly improves the recommendation accuracy by
reducing the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models
and returning more appropriate and text-relevant items to satisfy users. All

<p class="mathjax">Forensic pathology is critical in analyzing death manner and time from the
microscopic aspect to assist in the establishment of reliable factual bases for
criminal investigation. In practice, even the manual differentiation between
different postmortem organ tissues is challenging and relies on expertise,
considering that changes like putrefaction and autolysis could significantly
change typical histopathological appearance. Developing AI-based computational
pathology techniques to assist forensic pathologists is practically meaningful,
which requires reliable discriminative representation learning to capture
tissues' fine-grained postmortem patterns. To this end, we propose a framework
called FPath, in which a dedicated self-supervised contrastive learning
strategy and a context-aware multiple-instance learning (MIL) block are
designed to learn discriminative representations from postmortem
histopathological images acquired at varying magnification scales. Our
self-supervised learning step leverages multiple complementary contrastive
losses and regularization terms to train a double-tier backbone for
fine-grained and informative patch/instance embedding. Thereafter, the
context-aware MIL adaptively distills from the local instances a holistic
bag/image-level representation for the recognition task. On a large-scale
database of $19,607$ experimental rat postmortem images and $3,378$ real-world
human decedent images, our FPath led to state-of-the-art accuracy and promising
cross-domain generalization in recognizing seven different postmortem tissues.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) were introduced to enhance the
performance of wireless communication systems. However, from a service
provider's viewpoint, a concern with the use of an IRS is its effect on
out-of-band (OOB) quality of service. Specifically, if two operators, say X and
Y, provide services in a given geographical area using non-overlapping
frequency bands, and if operator X uses an IRS to enhance the spectral
efficiency (SE) of its users, does it degrade the performance of users served
by operator Y? We answer this question by analyzing the average and
instantaneous performances of the OOB operator considering both sub-6 GHz and
mmWave bands, accounting for their corresponding channel characteristics.
Specifically, we derive the ergodic sum-spectral efficiency achieved by the
operators under round-robin scheduling. We also derive the outage probability
and analyze the change in the SNR witnessed by an OOB user in the presence of
the IRS using stochastic dominance theory. Surprisingly, even though the IRS is
randomly configured from operator Y's point of view, the OOB operator still
benefits from the presence of the IRS, witnessing a performance enhancement for
free, in both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. This is because the IRS introduces
additional paths between the transmitter and receiver, increasing the overall
signal power arriving at the receiver and providing diversity benefits. We
numerically illustrate our findings and conclude that an IRS is always
beneficial to every operator, even when the IRS is deployed and controlled by
only one operator to serve its own users.

<p class="mathjax">Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a
promising approach to extending the capability of LLMs. Although some works
employ open-source LLMs for the tool learning task, most of them are trained in
a controlled environment in which LLMs only learn to execute the human-provided
tools. However, selecting proper tools from the large toolset is also a crucial
ability for the tool learning model to be applied in real-world applications.
Existing methods usually directly employ self-instruction methods to train the
model, which ignores differences in tool complexity. In this paper, we propose
the Confucius, a novel tool learning framework to train LLM to use complicated
tools in real-world scenarios, which contains two main phases: (1) We first
propose a multi-stage learning method to teach the LLM to use various tools
from an easy-to-difficult curriculum; (2) thenceforth, we propose the Iterative
Self-instruct from Introspective Feedback (ISIF) to dynamically construct the
dataset to improve the ability to use the complicated tool. Extensive
experiments conducted on both controlled and real-world settings demonstrate
the superiority of our tool learning framework in the real-world application
scenarios compared to both tuning-free (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude) and tuning-based
baselines (e.g. GPT4Tools).

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Transformer networks are beginning to replace pure
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the field of computer vision due to
their global receptive field and adaptability to input. However, the quadratic
computational complexity of softmax-attention limits the wide application in
image dehazing task, especially for high-resolution images. To address this
issue, we propose a new Transformer variant, which applies the Taylor expansion
to approximate the softmax-attention and achieves linear computational
complexity. A multi-scale attention refinement module is proposed as a
complement to correct the error of the Taylor expansion. Furthermore, we
introduce a multi-branch architecture with multi-scale patch embedding to the
proposed Transformer, which embeds features by overlapping deformable
convolution of different scales. The design of multi-scale patch embedding is
based on three key ideas: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2)
multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field.
Our model, named Multi-branch Transformer expanded by Taylor formula
(MB-TaylorFormer), can embed coarse to fine features more flexibly at the patch
embedding stage and capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited
computational cost. Experimental results on several dehazing benchmarks show
that MB-TaylorFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a light
computational burden. The source code and pre-trained models are available at
https://github.com/FVL2020/ICCV-2023-MB-TaylorFormer.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning based localization and mapping approaches have recently emerged
as a new research direction and receive significant attentions from both
industry and academia. Instead of creating hand-designed algorithms based on
physical models or geometric theories, deep learning solutions provide an
alternative to solve the problem in a data-driven way. Benefiting from the
ever-increasing volumes of data and computational power on devices, these
learning methods are fast evolving into a new area that shows potentials to
track self-motion and estimate environmental model accurately and robustly for
mobile agents. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey, and propose a
taxonomy for the localization and mapping methods using deep learning. This
survey aims to discuss two basic questions: whether deep learning is promising
to localization and mapping; how deep learning should be applied to solve this
problem. To this end, a series of localization and mapping topics are
investigated, from the learning based visual odometry, global relocalization,
to mapping, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). It is our hope
that this survey organically weaves together the recent works in this vein from
robotics, computer vision and machine learning communities, and serves as a
guideline for future researchers to apply deep learning to tackle the problem
of visual localization and mapping.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-agent systems outperform single agent in complex collaborative tasks.
However, in large-scale scenarios, ensuring timely information exchange during
decentralized task execution remains a challenge. This work presents an online
decentralized coordination scheme for multi-agent systems under complex local
tasks and intermittent communication constraints. Unlike existing strategies
that enforce all-time or intermittent connectivity, our approach allows agents
to join or leave communication networks at aperiodic intervals, as deemed
optimal by their online task execution. This scheme concurrently determines
local plans and refines the communication strategy, i.e., where and when to
communicate as a team. A decentralized potential game is modeled among agents,
for which a Nash equilibrium is generated iteratively through online local
search. It guarantees local task completion and intermittent communication
constraints. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted against several
strong baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Point clouds are collected nowadays from a plethora of sensors, some having
higher accuracies and higher costs, some having lower accuracies but also lower
costs. Not only there is a large choice for different sensors, but also these
can be transported by different platforms, which can provide different scan
geometries. In this work we test the extraction of four different keypoint
detectors and three feature descriptors. We benchmark performance in terms of
calculation time and we assess their performance in terms of accuracy in their
ability in coarse automatic co-registration of two clouds that are collected
with different sensors, platforms and scan geometries. One, which we define as
having the higher accuracy, and thus will be used as reference, was surveyed
via a UAV flight with a Riegl MiniVUX-3, the other on a bicycle with a Livox
Horizon over a walking path with un-even ground.The novelty in this work
consists in comparing several strategies for fast alignment of point clouds
from very different surveying geometries, as the drone has a bird's eye view
and the bicycle a ground-based view. An added challenge is related to the lower
cost of the bicycle sensor ensemble that, together with the rough terrain,
reasonably results in lower accuracy of the survey. The main idea is to use
range images to capture a simplified version of the geometry of the surveyed
area and then find the best features to match keypoints. Results show that NARF
features detected more keypoints and resulted in a faster co-registration
procedure in this scenariowhereas the accuracy of the co-registration is
similar to all the combinations of keypoint detectors and features.

<p class="mathjax">Previous deep learning efforts have focused on improving the performance of
Pulmonary Embolism(PE) diagnosis from Computed Tomography (CT) scans using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, the features from CT scans alone
are not always sufficient for the diagnosis of PE. CT scans along with
electronic heath records (EHR) can provide a better insight into the patients
condition and can lead to more accurate PE diagnosis. In this paper, we propose
Pulmonary Embolism Detection using Contrastive Learning (PECon), a supervised
contrastive pretraining strategy that employs both the patients CT scans as
well as the EHR data, aiming to enhance the alignment of feature
representations between the two modalities and leverage information to improve
the PE diagnosis. In order to achieve this, we make use of the class labels and
pull the sample features of the same class together, while pushing away those
of the other class. Results show that the proposed work outperforms the
existing techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RadFusion
dataset with an F1-score of 0.913, accuracy of 0.90 and an AUROC of 0.943.
Furthermore, we also explore the explainability of our approach in comparison
to other methods. Our code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Advertisement videos (ads) play an integral part in the domain of Internet
e-commerce as they amplify the reach of particular products to a broad audience
or can serve as a medium to raise awareness about specific issues through
concise narrative structures. The narrative structures of advertisements
involve several elements like reasoning about the broad content (topic and the
underlying message) and examining fine-grained details involving the transition
of perceived tone due to the specific sequence of events and interaction among
characters. In this work, to facilitate the understanding of advertisements
along the three important dimensions of topic categorization, perceived tone
transition, and social message detection, we introduce a multimodal
multilingual benchmark called MM-AU composed of over 8.4K videos (147 hours)
curated from multiple web sources. We explore multiple zero-shot reasoning
baselines through the application of large language models on the ads
transcripts. Further, we demonstrate that leveraging signals from multiple
modalities, including audio, video, and text, in multimodal transformer-based
supervised models leads to improved performance compared to unimodal
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Ranking is a crucial module using in the recommender system. In particular,
the ranking module using in our YoungTao recommendation scenario is to provide
an ordered list of items to users, to maximize the click number throughout the
recommendation session for each user. However, we found that the traditional
ranking method for optimizing Click-Through rate(CTR) cannot address our
ranking scenario well, since it completely ignores user leaving, and CTR is the
optimization goal for the one-step recommendation. To effectively undertake the
purpose of our ranking module, we propose a long-term optimization goal, named
as CTE (Click-Through quantity expectation), for explicitly taking the behavior
of user leaving into account. Based on CTE, we propose an effective model
trained by reinforcement learning. Moreover, we build a simulation environment
from offline log data for estimating PBR and CTR. We conduct extensive
experiments on offline datasets and an online e-commerce scenario in TaoBao.
Experimental results show that our method can boost performance effectively

<p class="mathjax">Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future
wireless communication systems. Channel estimation (CE) of RIS device is a
critical but also challenging issue for its development. The mainstream of
existing CE methods is confined to the so-called cascaded channel (CscdChn)
estimation scheme, which treats the multiplicative two-hop RIS channels as an
effective one and measures it as a whole. This CscdChn training method suffers
from severe double-fading attenuation loss, which significantly degrades the CE
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel RIS-transmitting (RIS-TX) based CE
scheme, which has lower pilot overhead than CscdChn scheme and effectively
overcomes the double-fading curse via incorporating only one single transmit
radio frequency (RF)-chain into RIS. We develop highly efficient gradient
descent (GD) and penalty duality decomposition (PDD)-based solutions to resolve
the pilot design task for the RIS-TX CE scheme, which is a difficult quartic
optimization problem. Our designed pilot signal outperforms the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) sequence, which is reported to be optimal for CscdChn
scheme. Besides, both theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed RIS-TX scheme exhibits distinct performance characteristics
as opposed to its CscdChn counterpart and yields superior accuracy when RIS
device is not extremely large.

<p class="mathjax">In the domain of semi-supervised learning (SSL), the conventional approach
involves training a learner with a limited amount of labeled data alongside a
substantial volume of unlabeled data, both drawn from the same underlying
distribution. However, for deep learning models, this standard practice may not
yield optimal results. In this research, we propose an alternative perspective,
suggesting that distributions that are more readily separable could offer
superior benefits to the learner as compared to the original distribution. To
achieve this, we present PruneSSL, a practical technique for selectively
removing examples from the original unlabeled dataset to enhance its
separability. We present an empirical study, showing that although PruneSSL
reduces the quantity of available training data for the learner, it
significantly improves the performance of various competitive SSL algorithms,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art results across several image classification
tasks.

emotion recognition, resulting in the difficulty of sharing the model across
subjects. Previous studies use domain adaptation algorithms to minimize the
global domain discrepancy while ignoring the class information, which may cause
misalignment of subdomains and reduce model performance. This paper proposes a
multi-subdomain adversarial network (MSAN) for cross-subject EEG-based emotion
recognition. MSAN uses adversarial training to model the discrepancy in the
global domain and subdomain to reduce the intra-class distance and enlarge the
inter-class distance. In addition, MSAN initializes parameters through a
pre-trained autoencoder to ensure the stability and convertibility of the
model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of MSAN is improved by
30.02\% on the SEED dataset comparing with the nontransfer method.

<p class="mathjax">Effective image restoration with large-size corruptions, such as blind image
inpainting, entails precise detection of corruption region masks which remains
extremely challenging due to diverse shapes and patterns of corruptions. In
this work, we present a novel method for automatic corruption detection, which
allows for blind corruption restoration without known corruption masks.
Specifically, we develop a hierarchical contrastive learning framework to
detect corrupted regions by capturing the intrinsic semantic distinctions
between corrupted and uncorrupted regions. In particular, our model detects the
corrupted mask in a coarse-to-fine manner by first predicting a coarse mask by
contrastive learning in low-resolution feature space and then refines the
uncertain area of the mask by high-resolution contrastive learning. A
specialized hierarchical interaction mechanism is designed to facilitate the
knowledge propagation of contrastive learning in different scales, boosting the
modeling performance substantially. The detected multi-scale corruption masks
are then leveraged to guide the corruption restoration. Detecting corrupted
regions by learning the contrastive distinctions rather than the semantic
patterns of corruptions, our model has well generalization ability across
different corruption patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate following
merits of our model: 1) the superior performance over other methods on both
corruption detection and various image restoration tasks including blind
inpainting and watermark removal, and 2) strong generalization across different
corruption patterns such as graffiti, random noise or other image content.

<p class="mathjax">Different machines can exhibit diverse frequency patterns in their emitted
sound. This feature has been recently explored in anomaly sound detection and
reached state-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods rely on the
manual or empirical determination of the frequency filter by observing the
effective frequency range in the training data, which may be impractical for
general application. This paper proposes an anomalous sound detection method
using self-attention-based frequency pattern analysis and spectral-temporal
information fusion. Our experiments demonstrate that the self-attention module
automatically and adaptively analyses the effective frequencies of a machine
sound and enhances that information in the spectral feature representation.
With spectral-temporal information fusion, the obtained audio feature
eventually improves the anomaly detection performance on the DCASE 2020
Challenge Task 2 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Drones have been widely used in many areas of our daily lives. It relieves
people of the burden of holding a controller all the time and makes drone
control easier to use for people with disabilities or occupied hands. However,
the control of aerial robots is more complicated compared to normal robots due
to factors such as uncontrollable height. Therefore, it is crucial to develop
an intelligent UAV that has the ability to talk to humans and follow natural
language commands. In this report, we present an aerial navigation task for the
2023 ICCV Conversation History. Based on the AVDN dataset containing more than
3k recorded navigation trajectories and asynchronous human-robot conversations,
we propose an effective method of fusion training of Human Attention Aided
Transformer model (HAA-Transformer) and Human Attention Aided LSTM (HAA-LSTM)
model, which achieves the prediction of the navigation routing points and human
attention. The method not only achieves high SR and SPL metrics, but also shows
a 7% improvement in GP metrics compared to the baseline model.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic approach to risk assessment of
robot systems by focusing on the impact of uncertainties. While various
approaches to identifying systematic hazards (e.g., bugs, design flaws, etc.)
can be found in current literature, little attention has been devoted to
evaluating risks in robot systems in a probabilistic manner. Existing methods
rely on discrete notions for dangerous events and assume that the consequences
of these can be described by simple logical operations. In this work, we
consider measurement uncertainties as one main contributor to the evolvement of
risks. Specifically, we study the impact of temporal and spatial uncertainties
on the occurrence probability of dangerous failures, thereby deriving an
approach for an uncertainty-aware risk assessment. Secondly, we introduce a
method to improve the statistical significance of our results: While the rare
occurrence of hazardous events makes it challenging to draw conclusions with
reliable accuracy, we show that importance sampling -- a technique that
successively generates samples in regions with sparse probability densities --
allows for overcoming this issue. We demonstrate the validity of our novel
uncertainty-aware risk assessment method in three simulation scenarios from the
domain of human-robot collaboration. Finally, we show how the results can be
used to evaluate arbitrary safety limits of robot systems.

<p class="mathjax">The field of dentistry is in the era of digital transformation. Particularly,
artificial intelligence is anticipated to play a significant role in digital
dentistry. AI holds the potential to significantly assist dental practitioners
and elevate diagnostic accuracy. In alignment with this vision, the 2023 MICCAI
DENTEX challenge aims to enhance the performance of dental panoramic X-ray
diagnosis and enumeration through technological advancement. In response, we
introduce DETDet, a Dual Ensemble Teeth Detection network. DETDet encompasses
two distinct modules dedicated to enumeration and diagnosis. Leveraging the
advantages of teeth mask data, we employ Mask-RCNN for the enumeration module.
For the diagnosis module, we adopt an ensemble model comprising DiffusionDet
and DINO. To further enhance precision scores, we integrate a complementary
module to harness the potential of unlabeled data. The code for our approach
will be made accessible at https://github.com/Bestever-choi/Evident

in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. We propose a method that enables to
limit the interference on passive users (whose presence may not be detected
since they do not transmit) with a small penalty to the throughput of active
users. Our approach abstracts away (in a simple, yet informative way) the
physical layer component and it leverages the directivity of mmWave links and

<p class="mathjax">Acquiring contact patterns between hands and nonrigid objects is a common
concern in the vision and robotics community. However, existing learning-based
methods focus more on contact with rigid ones from monocular images. When
adopting them for nonrigid contact, a major problem is that the existing
contact representation is restricted by the geometry of the object.
Consequently, contact neighborhoods are stored in an unordered manner and
contact features are difficult to align with image cues. At the core of our
approach lies a novel hand-object contact representation called RUPs (Region
Unwrapping Profiles), which unwrap the roughly estimated hand-object surfaces
as multiple high-resolution 2D regional profiles. The region grouping strategy
is consistent with the hand kinematic bone division because they are the
primitive initiators for a composite contact pattern. Based on this
representation, our Regional Unwrapping Transformer (RUFormer) learns the
correlation priors across regions from monocular inputs and predicts
corresponding contact and deformed transformations. Our experiments demonstrate
that the proposed framework can robustly estimate the deformed degrees and
deformed transformations, which makes it suitable for both nonrigid and rigid
contact.

<p class="mathjax">In set-based face recognition, we aim to compute the most discriminative
descriptor from an unbounded set of images and videos showing a single person.
A discriminative descriptor balances two policies when aggregating information
from a given set. The first is a quality-based policy: emphasizing high-quality
and down-weighting low-quality images. The second is a diversity-based policy:
emphasizing unique images in the set and down-weighting multiple occurrences of
similar images as found in video clips which can overwhelm the set
representation. This work frames face-set representation as a differentiable
coreset selection problem. Our model learns how to select a small coreset of
the input set that balances quality and diversity policies using a learned
metric parameterized by the face quality, optimized end-to-end. The selection
process is a differentiable farthest-point sampling (FPS) realized by
approximating the non-differentiable Argmax operation with differentiable
sampling from the Gumbel-Softmax distribution of distances. The small coreset
is later used as queries in a self and cross-attention architecture to enrich
the descriptor with information from the whole set. Our model is
order-invariant and linear in the input set size. We set a new SOTA to set face
verification on the IJB-B and IJB-C datasets. Our code is publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Classification of very high-resolution (VHR) aerial remote sensing (RS)
images is a well-established research area in the remote sensing community as
it provides valuable spatial information for decision-making. Existing works on
VHR aerial RS image classification produce an excellent classification
performance; nevertheless, they have a limited capability to well-represent VHR
RS images having complex and small objects, thereby leading to performance
instability. As such, we propose a novel plug-and-play multi-scale attention
feature extraction block (MSAFEB) based on multi-scale convolution at two
levels with skip connection, producing discriminative/salient information at a
deeper/finer level. The experimental study on two benchmark VHR aerial RS image
datasets (AID and NWPU) demonstrates that our proposal achieves a
stable/consistent performance (minimum standard deviation of $0.002$) and
competent overall classification performance (AID: 95.85\% and NWPU: 94.09\%).

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing 3D objects from extremely sparse views is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While recent techniques employ image diffusion models for
generating plausible images at novel viewpoints or for distilling pre-trained
diffusion priors into 3D representations using score distillation sampling
(SDS), these methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high-quality,
consistent, and detailed results for both novel-view synthesis (NVS) and
geometry. In this work, we present Sparse3D, a novel 3D reconstruction method
tailored for sparse view inputs. Our approach distills robust priors from a
multiview-consistent diffusion model to refine a neural radiance field.
Specifically, we employ a controller that harnesses epipolar features from
input views, guiding a pre-trained diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion,
to produce novel-view images that maintain 3D consistency with the input. By
tapping into 2D priors from powerful image diffusion models, our integrated
model consistently delivers high-quality results, even when faced with
open-world objects. To address the blurriness introduced by conventional SDS,
we introduce the category-score distillation sampling (C-SDS) to enhance
detail. We conduct experiments on CO3DV2 which is a multi-view dataset of
real-world objects. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate
that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art works on the metrics
regarding NVS and geometry reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing interacting hands from monocular images is indispensable in
AR/VR applications. Most existing solutions rely on the accurate localization
of each skeleton joint. However, these methods tend to be unreliable due to the
severe occlusion and confusing similarity among adjacent hand parts. This also
defies human perception because humans can quickly imitate an interaction
pattern without localizing all joints. Our key idea is to first construct a
two-hand interaction prior and recast the interaction reconstruction task as
the conditional sampling from the prior. To expand more interaction states, a
large-scale multimodal dataset with physical plausibility is proposed. Then a
VAE is trained to further condense these interaction patterns as latent codes
in a prior distribution. When looking for image cues that contribute to
interaction prior sampling, we propose the interaction adjacency heatmap (IAH).
Compared with a joint-wise heatmap for localization, IAH assigns denser visible
features to those invisible joints. Compared with an all-in-one visible
heatmap, it provides more fine-grained local interaction information in each
interaction region. Finally, the correlations between the extracted features
and corresponding interaction codes are linked by the ViT module. Comprehensive
evaluations on benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness of this
framework. The code and dataset are publicly available at
https://github.com/binghui-z/InterPrior_pytorch

<p class="mathjax">Estimating the shape and motion state of the myocardium is essential in
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.However, cine magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging is dominated by 2D slices, whose large slice spacing challenges
inter-slice shape reconstruction and motion acquisition.To address this
problem, we propose a 4D reconstruction method that decouples motion and shape,
which can predict the inter-/intra- shape and motion estimation from a given
sparse point cloud sequence obtained from limited slices. Our framework
comprises a neural motion model and an end-diastolic (ED) shape model. The
implicit ED shape model can learn a continuous boundary and encourage the
motion model to predict without the supervision of ground truth deformation,
and the motion model enables canonical input of the shape model by deforming
any point from any phase to the ED phase. Additionally, the constructed
ED-space enables pre-training of the shape model, thereby guiding the motion
model and addressing the issue of data scarcity. We propose the first 4D
myocardial dataset as we know and verify our method on the proposed, public,
and cross-modal datasets, showing superior reconstruction performance and
enabling various clinical applications.

<p class="mathjax">Edge detection, as a core component in a wide range of visionoriented tasks,
is to identify object boundaries and prominent edges in natural images. An edge
detector is desired to be both efficient and accurate for practical use. To
achieve the goal, two key issues should be concerned: 1) How to liberate deep
edge models from inefficient pre-trained backbones that are leveraged by most
existing deep learning methods, for saving the computational cost and cutting
the model size; and 2) How to mitigate the negative influence from noisy or
even wrong labels in training data, which widely exist in edge detection due to
the subjectivity and ambiguity of annotators, for the robustness and accuracy.
In this paper, we attempt to simultaneously address the above problems via
developing a collaborative learning based model, termed PEdger. The principle
behind our PEdger is that, the information learned from different training
moments and heterogeneous (recurrent and non recurrent in this work)
architectures, can be assembled to explore robust knowledge against noisy
annotations, even without the help of pre-training on extra data. Extensive
ablation studies together with quantitative and qualitative experimental
comparisons on the BSDS500 and NYUD datasets are conducted to verify the
effectiveness of our design, and demonstrate its superiority over other
competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and model size. Codes can be found at

<p class="mathjax">The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language
instructions with human-level fluency suggests many opportunities in healthcare
to reduce administrative burden and improve quality of care. However,
evaluating LLMs on realistic text generation tasks for healthcare remains
challenging. Existing question answering datasets for electronic health record
(EHR) data fail to capture the complexity of information needs and
documentation burdens experienced by clinicians. To address these challenges,
we introduce MedAlign, a benchmark dataset of 983 natural language instructions
for EHR data. MedAlign is curated by 15 clinicians (7 specialities), includes
clinician-written reference responses for 303 instructions, and provides 276
longitudinal EHRs for grounding instruction-response pairs. We used MedAlign to
evaluate 6 general domain LLMs, having clinicians rank the accuracy and quality
of each LLM response. We found high error rates, ranging from 35% (GPT-4) to
68% (MPT-7B-Instruct), and an 8.3% drop in accuracy moving from 32k to 2k
context lengths for GPT-4. Finally, we report correlations between clinician
rankings and automated natural language generation metrics as a way to rank
LLMs without human review. We make MedAlign available under a research data use
agreement to enable LLM evaluations on tasks aligned with clinician needs and
preferences.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a setting where a supervisor delegates an agent to perform a
certain control task, while the agent is incentivized to deviate from the given
policy to achieve its own goal. In this work, we synthesize the optimal
deceptive policies for an agent who attempts to hide its deviations from the
supervisor's policy. We study the deception problem in the continuous-state
discrete-time stochastic dynamics setting and, using motivations from
hypothesis testing theory, formulate a Kullback-Leibler control problem for the
synthesis of deceptive policies. This problem can be solved using backward
dynamic programming in principle, which suffers from the curse of
dimensionality. However, under the assumption of deterministic state dynamics,
we show that the optimal deceptive actions can be generated using path integral
control. This allows the agent to numerically compute the deceptive actions via
Monte Carlo simulations. Since Monte Carlo simulations can be efficiently
parallelized, our approach allows the agent to generate deceptive control
actions online. We show that the proposed simulation-driven control approach
asymptotically converges to the optimal control distribution.

<p class="mathjax">Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology that
enables the customization of electromagnetic propagation environments in
next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the optimal
pilot power allocation during the channel estimation stage to improve the
ergodic channel gain of RIS-assisted systems under practical imperfect channel
state information (CSI). Specifically, we commence by deriving an explicit
closed-form expression of the ergodic channel gain of a multi-RIS-aided
communication system that takes into account channel estimation errors. Then,
we formulate the pilot power allocation problem to maximize the ergodic channel
gain under imperfect CSI, subject to the average pilot power constraint. Then,
the method of Lagrange multipliers is invoked to obtain the optimal pilot power
allocation solution, which indicates that allocating more power to the pilots
for estimating the weak reflection channels is capable of effectively improving
the ergodic channel gain under imperfect CSI. Finally, extensive simulation
results corroborate our theoretical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Endoscopy is a widely used technique for the early detection of diseases or
robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS). Numerous deep learning
(DL)-based research works have been developed for automated diagnosis or
processing of endoscopic view. However, existing DL models may suffer from
catastrophic forgetting. When new target classes are introduced over time or
cross institutions, the performance of old classes may suffer severe
degradation. More seriously, data privacy and storage issues may lead to the
unavailability of old data when updating the model. Therefore, it is necessary
to develop a continual learning (CL) methodology to solve the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in endoscopic image segmentation. To tackle this, we
propose a Endoscopy Continual Semantic Segmentation (EndoCSS) framework that
does not involve the storage and privacy issues of exemplar data. The framework
includes a mini-batch pseudo-replay (MB-PR) mechanism and a self-adaptive noisy
cross-entropy (SAN-CE) loss. The MB-PR strategy circumvents privacy and storage
issues by generating pseudo-replay images through a generative model.
Meanwhile, the MB-PR strategy can also correct the model deviation to the
replay data and current training data, which is aroused by the significant
difference in the amount of current and replay images. Therefore, the model can
perform effective representation learning on both new and old tasks. SAN-CE
loss can help model fitting by adjusting the model's output logits, and also
improve the robustness of training. Extensive continual semantic segmentation
(CSS) experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method can robustly
and effectively address the catastrophic forgetting brought by class increment
in endoscopy scenes. The results show that our framework holds excellent
potential for real-world deployment in a streaming learning manner.

<p class="mathjax">Community detection is a powerful tool from complex networks analysis that
finds applications in various research areas. Several image segmentation
methods rely for instance on community detection algorithms as a black box in
order to compute undersegmentations, i.e. a small number of regions that
represent areas of interest of the image. However, to the best of our
knowledge, the efficiency of such an approach w.r.t. superpixels, that aim at
representing the image at a smaller level while preserving as much as possible
original information, has been neglected so far. The only related work seems to
be the one by Liu et. al. (IET Image Processing, 2022) that developed a
superpixels algorithm using a so-called modularity maximization approach,
leading to relevant results. We follow this line of research by studying the
efficiency of superpixels computed by state-of-the-art community detection
algorithms on a 4-connected pixel graph, so-called pixel-grid. We first detect
communities on such a graph and then apply a simple merging procedure that
allows to obtain the desired number of superpixels. As we shall see, such
methods result in the computation of relevant superpixels as emphasized by both
qualitative and quantitative experiments, according to different widely-used
metrics based on ground-truth comparison or on superpixels only. We observe
that the choice of the community detection algorithm has a great impact on the
number of communities and hence on the merging procedure. Similarly, small
variations on the pixel-grid may provide different results from both
qualitative and quantitative viewpoints. For the sake of completeness, we
compare our results with those of several state-of-the-art superpixels
algorithms as computed by Stutz et al. (Computer Vision and Image
Understanding, 2018).

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a simple, flexible and effective vision-language
(VL) tracking pipeline, termed \textbf{MMTrack}, which casts VL tracking as a
token generation task. Traditional paradigms address VL tracking task
indirectly with sophisticated prior designs, making them over-specialize on the
features of specific architectures or mechanisms. In contrast, our proposed
framework serializes language description and bounding box into a sequence of
discrete tokens. In this new design paradigm, all token queries are required to
perceive the desired target and directly predict spatial coordinates of the
target in an auto-regressive manner. The design without other prior modules
avoids multiple sub-tasks learning and hand-designed loss functions,
significantly reducing the complexity of VL tracking modeling and allowing our
tracker to use a simple cross-entropy loss as unified optimization objective
for VL tracking task. Extensive experiments on TNL2K, LaSOT, LaSOT$_{\rm{ext}}$
and OTB99-Lang benchmarks show that our approach achieves promising results,
compared to other state-of-the-arts.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning has been adapted to help solve NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems. One prevalent way is learning to construct solutions by
deep neural networks, which has been receiving more and more attention due to
the high efficiency and less requirement for expert knowledge. However, many
neural construction methods for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) focus on
synthetic problem instances with limited scales and specified node
distributions, leading to poor performance on real-world problems which usually
involve large scales together with complex and unknown node distributions. To
make neural VRP solvers more practical in real-world scenarios, we design an
auxiliary policy that learns from the local transferable topological features,
named local policy, and integrate it with a typical constructive policy (which
learns from the global information of VRP instances) to form an ensemble
policy. With joint training, the aggregated policies perform cooperatively and
complementarily to boost generalization. The experimental results on two
well-known benchmarks, TSPLIB and CVRPLIB, of travelling salesman problem and
capacitated VRP show that the ensemble policy consistently achieves better
generalization than state-of-the-art construction methods and even works well
on real-world problems with several thousand nodes.

<p class="mathjax">Video temporal character grouping locates appearing moments of major
characters within a video according to their identities. To this end, recent
works have evolved from unsupervised clustering to graph-based supervised
clustering. However, graph methods are built upon the premise of fixed affinity
graphs, bringing many inexact connections. Besides, they extract multi-modal
features with kinds of models, which are unfriendly to deployment. In this
paper, we present a unified and dynamic graph (UniDG) framework for temporal
character grouping. This is accomplished firstly by a unified representation
network that learns representations of multiple modalities within the same
space and still preserves the modality's uniqueness simultaneously. Secondly,
we present a dynamic graph clustering where the neighbors of different
quantities are dynamically constructed for each node via a cyclic matching
strategy, leading to a more reliable affinity graph. Thirdly, a progressive
association method is introduced to exploit spatial and temporal contexts among
different modalities, allowing multi-modal clustering results to be well fused.
As current datasets only provide pre-extracted features, we evaluate our UniDG
method on a collected dataset named MTCG, which contains each character's
appearing clips of face and body and speaking voice tracks. We also evaluate
our key components on existing clustering and retrieval datasets to verify the
generalization ability. Experimental results manifest that our method can
achieve promising results and outperform several state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Effective energy management of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations is
critical to supporting the transport sector's sustainable energy transition.
This paper addresses the EV charging coordination by considering
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy exchange as the flexibility to harness in EV
charging stations. Moreover, this paper takes into account EV user experiences,
such as charging satisfaction and fairness. We propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach to coordinate EV charging with V2V
energy exchange while considering uncertainties in the EV arrival time, energy
price, and solar energy generation. The exploration capability of MARL is
enhanced by introducing parameter noise into MARL's neural network models.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of
our proposed method compared to traditional optimization baselines. The
decentralized execution of the algorithm enables it to effectively deal with
partial system faults in the charging station.

<p class="mathjax">Cloth-changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) is a challenging task that
aims to retrieve the target person across multiple surveillance cameras when
clothing changes might happen. Despite recent progress in CC-ReID, existing
approaches are still hindered by the interference of clothing variations since
they lack effective constraints to keep the model consistently focused on
clothing-irrelevant regions. To address this issue, we present a Semantic-aware
Consistency Network (SCNet) to learn identity-related semantic features by
proposing effective consistency constraints. Specifically, we generate the
black-clothing image by erasing pixels in the clothing area, which explicitly
mitigates the interference from clothing variations. In addition, to fully
exploit the fine-grained identity information, a head-enhanced attention module
is introduced, which learns soft attention maps by utilizing the proposed
part-based matching loss to highlight head information. We further design a
semantic consistency loss to facilitate the learning of high-level
identity-related semantic features, forcing the model to focus on semantically
consistent cloth-irrelevant regions. By using the consistency constraint, our
model does not require any extra auxiliary segmentation module to generate the
black-clothing image or locate the head region during the inference stage.
Extensive experiments on four cloth-changing person Re-ID datasets (LTCC, PRCC,
Vc-Clothes, and DeepChange) demonstrate that our proposed SCNet makes

<p class="mathjax">Residential occupancy detection has become an enabling technology in today's
urbanized world for various smart home applications, such as building
automation, energy management, and improved security and comfort.
Digitalization of the energy system provides smart meter data that can be used
for occupancy detection in a non-intrusive manner without causing concerns
regarding privacy and data security. In particular, deep learning techniques
make it possible to infer occupancy from low-resolution smart meter data, such
that the need for accurate occupancy detection with privacy preservation can be
achieved. Our work is thus motivated to develop a privacy-aware and effective
model for residential occupancy detection in contemporary living environments.
Our model aims to leverage the advantages of both recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), which are adept at capturing local temporal dependencies, and
transformers, which are effective at handling global temporal dependencies. Our
designed hybrid transformer-RNN model detects residential occupancy using
hourly smart meter data, achieving an accuracy of nearly 92\% across households
with diverse profiles. We validate the effectiveness of our method using a
publicly accessible dataset and demonstrate its performance by comparing it
with state-of-the-art models, including attention-based occupancy detection
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Natural language is among the most accessible tools for explaining decisions
to humans, and large pretrained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities to generate coherent natural language explanations (NLE).
The existing NLE research perspectives do not take the audience into account.
An NLE can have high textual quality, but it might not accommodate audiences'
needs and preference. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative
perspective, situated NLE, including a situated generation framework and a
situated evaluation framework. On the generation side, we propose simple prompt
engineering methods that adapt the NLEs to situations. In human studies, the
annotators preferred the situated NLEs. On the evaluation side, we set up
automated evaluation scores in lexical, semantic, and pragmatic categories. The
scores can be used to select the most suitable prompts to generate NLEs.
Situated NLE provides a perspective to conduct further research on automatic
NLE generations.

<p class="mathjax">Pure electric vehicles (PEVs) are increasingly adopted to decarbonize the
transport sector and mitigate global warming. However, the inadequate PEV
charging infrastructure may hinder the further adoption of PEVs in the
large-scale traffic network, which calls for effective planning solutions for
the charging station (CS) placement. The deployment of charging infrastructure
inevitably increases the load on the associated power distribution network.
Therefore, we are motivated to develop a comprehensive multi-objective
framework for optimal CS placement in a traffic network overlaid by a
distribution network, considering multiple stakeholders' interested factors,
such as traffic flow, PEV charging time cost, PEV travel distance, and the
reliability of the distribution network. We leverage a cross-entropy-based
method to solve the optimal CS placement and evaluate our method in a
real-world 183-node traffic network in Chengdu, China, overlaid by a 26-region
distribution network. It is demonstrated that our work provides various viable
planning options favoring different objectives for the stakeholders'
decision-making in practice.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve model performance. Traditional SSL methods assume that labeled and
unlabeled data share the same label space. However, in real-world applications,
especially when the labeled training set is small, there may be classes that
are missing from the labeled set. Existing frameworks aim to either reject all
unseen classes (open-set SSL) or to discover unseen classes by partitioning an
unlabeled set during training (open-world SSL). In our work, we construct a
classifier for points from both seen and unseen classes. Our approach is based
on extending an existing SSL method, such as FlexMatch, by incorporating an
additional entropy loss. This enhancement allows our method to improve the
performance of any existing SSL method in the classification of both seen and
unseen classes. We demonstrate large improvement gains over state-of-the-art
SSL, open-set SSL, and open-world SSL methods, on two benchmark image
classification data sets, CIFAR-100 and STL-10. The gains are most pronounced
when the labeled data is severely limited (1-25 labeled examples per class).

<p class="mathjax">A knowledge gap persists between Machine Learning (ML) developers (e.g., data
scientists) and practitioners (e.g., clinicians), hampering the full
utilization of ML for clinical data analysis. We investigated the potential of
the chatGPT Code Interpreter (CI), an extension of GPT-4, to bridge this gap
and perform ML analyses efficiently. Real-world clinical datasets and study
details from large trials across various medical specialties were presented to
chatGPT CI without specific guidance. ChatGPT CI autonomously developed
state-of-the-art ML models based on the original study's training data to
predict clinical outcomes such as cancer development, cancer progression,
disease complications, or biomarkers such as pathogenic gene sequences.
Strikingly, these ML models matched or outperformed their published
counterparts. We conclude that chatGPT CI offers a promising avenue to
democratize ML in medicine, making advanced analytics accessible to non-ML
experts and promoting broader applications in medical research and practice.

reproduce and validate research results. It is a well-known fact that the
scientific community faces challenges related to transparency, reliability, and
the reproducibility of empirical published results. Consequently, the design
and preparation of reproducible artifacts has a fundamental role in the
development of science. Reproducible artifacts comprise comprehensive
documentation, data, and code that enable replication and validation of
research findings by others. In this work, we discuss a methodology to
construct reproducible artifacts based on Docker. Our presentation centers
around the preparation of an artifact to be submitted to scientific venues that
encourage or require this process. This report's primary audience are
scientists working with empirical computer science; however, we believe that
the presented methodology can be extended to other technology-oriented
empirical disciplines.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the fundamental problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on
3D point clouds has been motivated by a wide variety of applications in
robotics, virtual reality, and scene understanding, to name a few. The point
cloud data acquisition procedures manifest themselves as significant domain
discrepancies and geometric variations among both similar and dissimilar
classes. The standard domain adaptation methods developed for images do not
directly translate to point cloud data because of their complex geometric
nature. To address this challenge, we leverage the idea of multimodality and
alignment between distributions. We propose a new UDA architecture for point
cloud classification that benefits from multimodal contrastive learning to get
better class separation in both domains individually. Further, the use of
optimal transport (OT) aims at learning source and target data distributions
jointly to reduce the cross-domain shift and provide a better alignment. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study on PointDA-10 and GraspNetPC-10 and
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on GraspNetPC-10
(with approx 4-12% margin) and best average performance on PointDA-10. Our
ablation studies and decision boundary analysis also validate the significance
of our contrastive learning module and OT alignment.

<p class="mathjax">A key numerical difficulty in compressible fluid dynamics is the formation of
shock waves. Shock waves feature jump discontinuities in the velocity and
density of the fluid and thus preclude the existence of classical solutions to
the compressible Euler equations. Weak "entropy" solutions are commonly defined
by viscous regularization, but even small amounts of viscosity can
substantially change the long-term behavior of the solution. In this work, we
propose an inviscid regularization based on ideas from semidefinite programming
and information geometry. From a Lagrangian perspective, shock formation in
entropy solutions amounts to inelastic collisions of fluid particles. Their
trajectories are akin to that of projected gradient descent on a feasible set
of nonintersecting paths. We regularize these trajectories by replacing them
with solution paths of interior point methods based on log determinantal
barrier functions. These paths are geodesic curves with respect to the
information geometry induced by the barrier function. Thus, our regularization
amounts to replacing the Euclidean geometry of phase space with a suitable
information geometry. We extend this idea to infinite families of paths by
viewing Euler's equations as a dynamical system on a diffeomorphism manifold.
Our regularization embeds this manifold into an information geometric ambient
space, equipping it with a geodesically complete geometry. Expressing the
resulting Lagrangian equations in Eulerian form, we derive a regularized Euler
equation in conservation form. Numerical experiments on one and two-dimensional
problems show its promise as a numerical tool.

<p class="mathjax">Turbo-Codes (TC) are a family of convolutional codes enabling
Forward-Error-Correction (FEC) while approaching the theoretical limit of
channel capacity predicted by Shannons theorem. One of the bottlenecks of a

algorithms require stalling the input vector bits before the bit rearrangement
causing a delay in the overall process. This paper presents performance
enhancement via a parallel algorithm for the interleaving stage of a Turbo
Encoder application compliant with the DVB-RCS2 standard. The algorithm
efficiently implements the interleaving operation while utilizing attributes of

<p class="mathjax">Temporal Interaction Graphs (TIGs) are widely employed to model intricate
real-world systems such as financial systems and social networks. To capture
the dynamism and interdependencies of nodes, existing TIG embedding models need
to process edges sequentially and chronologically. However, this requirement
prevents it from being processed in parallel and struggle to accommodate
burgeoning data volumes to GPU. Consequently, many large-scale temporal
interaction graphs are confined to CPU processing. Furthermore, a generalized
GPU scaling and acceleration approach remains unavailable. To facilitate
large-scale TIGs' implementation on GPUs for acceleration, we introduce a novel
training approach namely Streaming Edge Partitioning and Parallel Acceleration
for Temporal Interaction Graph Embedding (SPEED). The SPEED is comprised of a
Streaming Edge Partitioning Component (SEP) which addresses space overhead
issue by assigning fewer nodes to each GPU, and a Parallel Acceleration
Component (PAC) which enables simultaneous training of different sub-graphs,
addressing time overhead issue. Our method can achieve a good balance in
computing resources, computing time, and downstream task performance. Empirical
validation across 7 real-world datasets demonstrates the potential to expedite
training speeds by a factor of up to 19.29x. Simultaneously, resource
consumption of a single-GPU can be diminished by up to 69%, thus enabling the
multiple GPU-based training and acceleration encompassing millions of nodes and
billions of edges. Furthermore, our approach also maintains its competitiveness
in downstream tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The Multidepot Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MCVRP) is a well-known
variant of the classic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), where we
need to route capacitated vehicles located in multiple depots to serve
customers' demand such that each vehicle must return to the depot it starts,
and the total traveling distance is minimized. There are three variants of
MCVRP according to the property of the demand: unit-demand, splittable and
unsplittable. We study approximation algorithms for $k$-MCVRP in metric graphs
where $k$ is the capacity of each vehicle, and all three versions are APX-hard
for any constant $k\geq 3$. Previously, Li and Simchi-Levi proposed a
$(2\alpha+1-\alpha/k)$-approximation algorithm for splittable and unit-demand
$k$-MCVRP and a $(2\alpha+2-2\alpha/k)$-approximation algorithm for
unsplittable $k$-MCVRP, where $\alpha=3/2-10^{-36}$ is the current best
approximation ratio for metric TSP. Harks et al. further improved the ratio to
4 for the unsplittable case. We give a $(4-1/1500)$-approximation algorithm for
unit-demand and splittable $k$-MCVRP, and a $(4-1/50000)$-approximation
algorithm for unsplittable $k$-MCVRP. Furthermore, we give a
$(3+\ln2-\max\{\Theta(1/\sqrt{k}),1/9000\})$-approximation algorithm for
splittable and unit-demand $k$-MCVRP, and a
$(3+\ln2-\Theta(1/\sqrt{k}))$-approximation algorithm for unsplittable
$k$-MCVRP under the assumption that the capacity $k$ is a fixed constant. Our
results are based on recent progress in approximating CVRP.

<p class="mathjax">A novel hack involving Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged, leveraging
adversarial suffixes to trick models into generating perilous responses. This
method has garnered considerable attention from reputable media outlets such as
the New York Times and Wired, thereby influencing public perception regarding
the security and safety of LLMs. In this study, we advocate the utilization of
perplexity as one of the means to recognize such potential attacks. The
underlying concept behind these hacks revolves around appending an unusually
constructed string of text to a harmful query that would otherwise be blocked.
This maneuver confuses the protective mechanisms and tricks the model into
generating a forbidden response. Such scenarios could result in providing
detailed instructions to a malicious user for constructing explosives or
orchestrating a bank heist. Our investigation demonstrates the feasibility of
employing perplexity, a prevalent natural language processing metric, to detect
these adversarial tactics before generating a forbidden response. By evaluating
the perplexity of queries with and without such adversarial suffixes using an
open-source LLM, we discovered that nearly 90 percent were above a perplexity
of 1000. This contrast underscores the efficacy of perplexity for detecting
this type of exploit.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
scaled-up segmentation models, enabling zero-shot generalization across a
variety of domains. By leveraging large-scale foundational models as
pre-trained models, it is a natural progression to fine-tune SAM for specific
domains to further enhance performances. However, the adoption of foundational
models in the medical domain presents a challenge due to the difficulty and
expense of labeling sufficient data for adaptation within hospital systems. In
this paper, we introduce an efficient and practical approach for fine-tuning
SAM using a limited number of exemplars, making it suitable for such scenarios.
Our approach combines two established techniques from the literature: an
exemplar-guided synthesis module and the widely recognized Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning strategy, serving as data-level and model-level attempts
respectively. Interestingly, our empirical findings suggest that SAM can be
effectively aligned within the medical domain even with few labeled data. We
validate our approach through experiments on brain tumor segmentation (BraTS)
and multi-organ CT segmentation (Synapse). The comprehensive results underscore
the feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach, paving the way for the
practical application of SAM in the medical domain.

<p class="mathjax">Hashing is a common technique used in data processing, with a strong impact
on the time and resources spent on computation. Hashing also affects the
applicability of theoretical results that often assume access to (unrealistic)
uniform/fully-random hash functions. In this paper, we are concerned with
designing hash functions that are practical and come with strong theoretical
guarantees on their performance.
<br />To this end, we present tornado tabulation hashing, which is simple, fast,
and exhibits a certain full, local randomness property that provably makes
diverse algorithms perform almost as if (abstract) fully-random hashing was
used. For example, this includes classic linear probing, the widely used
HyperLogLog algorithm of Flajolet, Fusy, Gandouet, Meunier [AOFA 97] for
counting distinct elements, and the one-permutation hashing of Li, Owen, and
Zhang [NIPS 12] for large-scale machine learning. We also provide a very
efficient solution for the classical problem of obtaining fully-random hashing
on a fixed (but unknown to the hash function) set of $n$ keys using $O(n)$
space. As a consequence, we get more efficient implementations of the splitting
trick of Dietzfelbinger and Rink [ICALP'09] and the succinct space uniform
hashing of Pagh and Pagh [SICOMP'08].
<br />Tornado tabulation hashing is based on a simple method to systematically
break dependencies in tabulation-based hashing techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) rely on effective path planning and
tracking control to accomplish complex tasks in various domains. Reinforcement
Learning (RL) methods are becoming increasingly popular in control
applications, as they can learn from data and deal with unmodelled dynamics.
Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), such as UAVs, integrate sensing, network
communication, control, and computation to solve challenging problems. In this
context, Software Rejuvenation (SR) is a protection mechanism that refreshes
the control software to mitigate cyber-attacks, but it can affect the tracking
controller's performance due to discrepancies between the control software and
the physical system state. Traditional approaches to mitigate this effect are
conservative, hindering the overall system performance. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that incorporates Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep
RL) into SR to design a safe and high-performing tracking controller. Our
approach optimizes safety and performance, and we demonstrate its effectiveness
during UAV simulations. We compare our approach with traditional methods and
show that it improves the system's performance while maintaining safety
constraints.

decomposition-based method, which is the only traditional algorithm available
to solve this problem, leads to severe artifacts which renders the
reconstructed field as unusable. With the objective of overcoming this
computational bottleneck, we train a ResBlock based U-Net to recover the

<p class="mathjax">Visualization literacy is an essential skill for accurately interpreting data
to inform critical decisions. Consequently, it is vital to understand the
evolution of this ability and devise targeted interventions to enhance it,
requiring concise and repeatable assessments of visualization literacy for
individuals. However, current assessments, such as the Visualization Literacy
Assessment Test (VLAT), are time-consuming due to their fixed, lengthy format.
To address this limitation, we develop two streamlined computerized adaptive
tests (CATs) for visualization literacy, A-VLAT and A-CALVI, which measure the
same set of skills as their original versions in half the number of questions.
Specifically, we (1) employ item response theory (IRT) and non-psychometric
constraints to construct adaptive versions of the assessments, (2) finalize the
configurations of adaptation through simulation, (3) refine the composition of
test items of A-CALVI via a qualitative study, and (4) demonstrate the
test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.98 and 0.98) and convergent validity
(correlation: 0.81 and 0.66) of both CATs via four online studies. We discuss
practical recommendations for using our CATs and opportunities for further
customization to leverage the full potential of adaptive assessments. All

<p class="mathjax">Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have revolutionized the field
of natural language processing (NLP) with remarkable performance in various
tasks and also extend their power to multimodal domains. Despite their success,
large GPT models like GPT-4 face inherent limitations such as considerable
size, high computational requirements, complex deployment processes, and closed
development loops. These constraints restrict their widespread adoption and
raise concerns regarding their responsible development and usage. The need for
user-friendly, relatively small, and open-sourced alternative GPT models arises
from the desire to overcome these limitations while retaining high performance.
In this survey paper, we provide an examination of alternative open-sourced
models of large GPTs, focusing on user-friendly and relatively small models
that facilitate easier deployment and accessibility. Through this extensive
survey, we aim to equip researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts with a
thorough understanding of user-friendly and relatively small open-sourced
models of large GPTs, their current state, challenges, and future research
directions, inspiring the development of more efficient, accessible, and
versatile GPT models that cater to the broader scientific community and advance
the field of general artificial intelligence. The source contents are

<p class="mathjax">Generating 3D images of complex objects conditionally from a few 2D views is
a difficult synthesis problem, compounded by issues such as domain gap and
geometric misalignment. For instance, a unified framework such as Generative
Adversarial Networks cannot achieve this unless they explicitly define both a
domain-invariant and geometric-invariant joint latent distribution, whereas
Neural Radiance Fields are generally unable to handle both issues as they
optimize at the pixel level. By contrast, we propose a simple and novel 2D to
3D synthesis approach based on conditional diffusion with vector-quantized
codes. Operating in an information-rich code space enables high-resolution 3D
synthesis via full-coverage attention across the views. Specifically, we
generate the 3D codes (e.g. for CT images) conditional on previously generated
3D codes and the entire codebook of two 2D views (e.g. 2D X-rays). Qualitative
and quantitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over
specialized methods across varied evaluation criteria, including fidelity
metrics such as density, coverage, and distortion metrics for two complex
volumetric imagery datasets from in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">In the real world, image degradations caused by rain often exhibit a
combination of rain streaks and raindrops, thereby increasing the challenges of
recovering the underlying clean image. Note that the rain streaks and raindrops
have diverse shapes, sizes, and locations in the captured image, and thus
modeling the correlation relationship between irregular degradations caused by
rain artifacts is a necessary prerequisite for image deraining. This paper aims
to present an efficient and flexible mechanism to learn and model degradation
relationships in a global view, thereby achieving a unified removal of
intricate rain scenes. To do so, we propose a Sparse Sampling Transformer based
on Uncertainty-Driven Ranking, dubbed UDR-S2Former. Compared to previous
methods, our UDR-S2Former has three merits. First, it can adaptively sample
relevant image degradation information to model underlying degradation
relationships. Second, explicit application of the uncertainty-driven ranking
strategy can facilitate the network to attend to degradation features and
understand the reconstruction process. Finally, experimental results show that
our UDR-S2Former clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Large pretrained language models (PLM) have become de facto news encoders in
modern news recommender systems, due to their strong ability in comprehending
textual content. These huge Transformer-based architectures, when finetuned on
recommendation tasks, can greatly improve news recommendation performance.
However, the PLM-based pretrain-finetune framework incurs high computational
cost and energy consumption, primarily due to the extensive redundant
processing of news encoding during each training epoch. In this paper, we
propose the ``Only Encode Once'' framework for news recommendation (OLEO), by
decoupling news representation learning from downstream recommendation task
learning. The decoupled design makes content-based news recommender as green
and efficient as id-based ones, leading to great reduction in computational
cost and training resources. Extensive experiments show that our OLEO framework
can reduce carbon emissions by up to 13 times compared with the
state-of-the-art pretrain-finetune framework and maintain a competitive or even
superior performance level. The source code is released for reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">The development of transformer-based models has resulted in significant
advances in addressing various vision and NLP-based research challenges.
However, the progress made in transformer-based methods has not been
effectively applied to biosensing research. This paper presents a novel Unified
Biosensor-Vision Multi-modal Transformer-based (UBVMT) method to classify
emotions in an arousal-valence space by combining a 2D representation of an
ECG/PPG signal with the face information. To achieve this goal, we first
investigate and compare the unimodal emotion recognition performance of three
image-based representations of the ECG/PPG signal. We then present our UBVMT
network which is trained to perform emotion recognition by combining the 2D
image-based representation of the ECG/PPG signal and the facial expression
features. Our unified transformer model consists of homogeneous transformer
blocks that take as an input the 2D representation of the ECG/PPG signal and
the corresponding face frame for emotion representation learning with minimal
modality-specific design. Our UBVMT model is trained by reconstructing masked
patches of video frames and 2D images of ECG/PPG signals, and contrastive
modeling to align face and ECG/PPG data. Extensive experiments on the
MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP datasets show that our Unified UBVMT-based model produces
comparable results to the state-of-the-art techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Explaining concepts by contrasting examples is an efficient and convenient
way of giving insights into the reasons behind a classification decision. This
is of particular interest in decision-critical domains, such as medical
diagnostics. One particular challenging use case is to distinguish facial
expressions of pain and other states, such as disgust, due to high similarity
of manifestation. In this paper, we present an approach for generating
contrastive explanations to explain facial expressions of pain and disgust
shown in video sequences. We implement and compare two approaches for
contrastive explanation generation. The first approach explains a specific pain
instance in contrast to the most similar disgust instance(s) based on the
occurrence of facial expressions (attributes). The second approach takes into
account which temporal relations hold between intervals of facial expressions
within a sequence (relations). The input to our explanation generation approach
is the output of an interpretable rule-based classifier for pain and disgust.We
utilize two different similarity metrics to determine near misses and far
misses as contrasting instances. Our results show that near miss explanations
are shorter than far miss explanations, independent from the applied similarity
metric. The outcome of our evaluation indicates that pain and disgust can be
distinguished with the help of temporal relations. We currently plan
experiments to evaluate how the explanations help in teaching concepts and how
they could be enhanced by further modalities and interaction.

<p class="mathjax">Lawful Interception (LI) is a legal obligation of Communication Service
Providers (CSPs) to provide interception capabilities to Law Enforcement
Agencies (LEAs) in order to gain insightful data from network communications
for criminal proceedings, e.g., network identifiers for tracking suspects. With
the privacy-enhancements of network identifiers in the 5th generation of mobile
networks (5G), LEAs need to interact with CSPs for network identifier
resolution. This raises new privacy issues, as untrusted CSPs are able to infer
sensitive information about ongoing investigations, e.g., the identities of
their subscribers under suspicion. In this work, we propose P3LI5, a novel
system that enables LEAs to privately query CSPs for network identifier
resolution leveraging on an information retrieval protocol, SparseWPIR, that is
based on private information retrieval and its weakly private version. As such,
P3LI5 can be adapted to various operational scenarios with different
confidentiality or latency requirements, by selectively allowing a bounded
information leakage for improved performance. We implement P3LI5 on the 5G LI
infrastructure using well known open-source projects and demonstrate its
scalability to large databases while retaining low latency. To the best of our
knowledge, P3LI5 is the first proposal for addressing the privacy issues raised
by the mandatory requirement for LI on the 5G core network.

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation strategies are typically evaluated by using previously logged
data, employing off-policy evaluation methods to estimate their expected
performance. However, for strategies that present users with slates of multiple
items, the resulting combinatorial action space renders many of these methods
impractical. Prior work has developed estimators that leverage the structure in
slates to estimate the expected off-policy performance, but the estimation of
the entire performance distribution remains elusive. Estimating the complete
distribution allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of recommendation
strategies, particularly along the axes of risk and fairness that employ
metrics computable from the distribution. In this paper, we propose an
estimator for the complete off-policy performance distribution for slates and
establish conditions under which the estimator is unbiased and consistent. This
builds upon prior work on off-policy evaluation for slates and off-policy
distribution estimation in reinforcement learning. We validate the efficacy of
our method empirically on synthetic data as well as on a slate recommendation
simulator constructed from real-world data (MovieLens-20M). Our results show a
significant reduction in estimation variance and improved sample efficiency
over prior work across a range of slate structures.

<p class="mathjax">Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships
involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.

<p class="mathjax">Ensembles, which employ a set of classifiers to enhance classification
accuracy collectively, are crucial in the era of big data. However, although
there is general agreement that the relation between ensemble size and its
prediction accuracy, the exact nature of this relationship is still unknown. We
introduce a novel perspective, rooted in the linear independence of
classifier's votes, to analyze the interplay between ensemble size and
prediction accuracy. This framework reveals a theoretical link, consequently
proposing an ensemble size based on this relationship. Our study builds upon a
geometric framework and develops a series of theorems. These theorems clarify
the role of linear dependency in crafting ensembles. We present a method to
determine the minimum ensemble size required to ensure a target probability of
linearly independent votes among component classifiers. Incorporating real and
synthetic datasets, our empirical results demonstrate a trend: increasing the
number of classifiers enhances accuracy, as predicted by our theoretical
insights. However, we also identify a point of diminishing returns, beyond
which additional classifiers provide diminishing improvements in accuracy.
Surprisingly, the calculated ideal ensemble size deviates from empirical
results for certain datasets, emphasizing the influence of other factors. This
study opens avenues for deeper investigations into the complex dynamics
governing ensemble design and offers guidance for constructing efficient and
effective ensembles in practical scenarios.

assets, and other media using AI algorithms. Due to its wide range of
applications and the demonstrated potential of recent works, AIGC developments
have been attracting a lot of attention recently, and AIGC methods have been
developed for various data modalities, such as image, video, text, 3D shape (as
voxels, point clouds, meshes, and neural implicit fields), 3D scene, 3D human
avatar (body and head), 3D motion, and audio -- each presenting different
characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, there have also been many
significant developments in cross-modality AIGC methods, where generative
methods can receive conditioning input in one modality and produce outputs in
another. Examples include going from various modalities to image, video, 3D
shape, 3D scene, 3D avatar (body and head), 3D motion (skeleton and avatar),
and audio modalities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of AIGC
methods across different data modalities, including both single-modal and
cross-modality methods, highlighting the various challenges, representative
works, and recent technical directions in each setting. We also present
comparative results on several benchmark datasets in various modalities.

<p class="mathjax">Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the neural mechanisms that
enable specific behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging
causality-based methods. While these approaches have identified neural circuits
that copy spans of text, capture factual knowledge, and more, they remain
unusable for multimodal models since adapting these tools to the
vision-language domain requires considerable architectural changes. In this
work, we adapt a unimodal causal tracing tool to BLIP to enable the study of
the neural mechanisms underlying image-conditioned text generation. We
demonstrate our approach on a visual question answering dataset, highlighting
the causal relevance of later layer representations for all tokens.
Furthermore, we release our BLIP causal tracing tool as open source to enable
further experimentation in vision-language mechanistic interpretability by the
community. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Class imbalance is prevalent in real-world node classification tasks and
often biases graph learning models toward majority classes. Most existing
studies root from a node-centric perspective and aim to address the class
imbalance in training data by node/class-wise reweighting or resampling. In
this paper, we approach the source of the class-imbalance bias from an
under-explored topology-centric perspective. Our investigation reveals that
beyond the inherently skewed training class distribution, the graph topology
also plays an important role in the formation of predictive bias: we identify
two fundamental challenges, namely ambivalent and distant message-passing, that
can exacerbate the bias by aggravating majority-class over-generalization and
minority-class misclassification. In light of these findings, we devise a
lightweight topological augmentation method ToBA to dynamically rectify the
nodes influenced by ambivalent/distant message-passing during graph learning,
so as to mitigate the class-imbalance bias. We highlight that ToBA is a
model-agnostic, efficient, and versatile solution that can be seamlessly
combined with and further boost other imbalance-handling techniques. Systematic
experiments validate the superior performance of ToBA in both promoting
imbalanced node classification and mitigating the prediction bias between
different classes.

<p class="mathjax">Conditional branches pose a challenge for code optimisation, particularly in
low latency settings. For better performance, processors leverage dedicated
hardware to predict the outcome of a branch and execute the following
instructions speculatively, a powerful optimisation. Modern branch predictors
employ sophisticated algorithms and heuristics that utilise historical data and
patterns to make predictions, and often, are extremely effective at doing so.
Consequently, programmers may inadvertently underestimate the cost of
misprediction when benchmarking code with synthetic data that is either too
short or too predictable. While eliminating branches may not always be
feasible, C++20 introduced the [[likely]] and [[unlikely]] attributes that
enable the compiler to perform spot optimisations on assembly code associated
with likely execution paths. Can we do better than this?
<br />This work presents the development of a novel language construct, referred to
as a semi-static condition, which enables programmers to dynamically modify the
direction of a branch at run-time by modifying the assembly code within the
underlying executable. Subsequently, we explore scenarios where the use of
semi-static conditions outperforms traditional conditional branching,
highlighting their potential applications in real-time machine learning and
high-frequency trading. Throughout the development process, key considerations
of performance, portability, syntax, and security were taken into account.

<p class="mathjax">The language ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often unbalanced
towards English because of the imbalance in the distribution of the
pre-training data. This disparity is demanded in further fine-tuning and
affecting the cross-lingual abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose to
empower Instructiontuned LLMs (It-LLMs) in languages other than English by
building semantic alignment between them. Hence, we propose CrossAlpaca, an
It-LLM with cross-lingual instruction-following and Translation-following
demonstrations to improve semantic alignment between languages. We validate our
approach on the multilingual Question Answering (QA) benchmarks XQUAD and MLQA
and adapted versions of MMLU and BBH. Our models, tested over six different
languages, outperform the It-LLMs tuned on monolingual data. The final results
show that instruction tuning on non-English data is not enough and that
semantic alignment can be further improved by Translation-following
demonstrations.

<p class="mathjax">We present a new framework for computing fine-scale solutions of multiscale
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using operator learning tools. Obtaining
fine-scale solutions of multiscale PDEs can be challenging, but there are many
inexpensive computational methods for obtaining coarse-scale solutions.
Additionally, in many real-world applications, fine-scale solutions can only be
observed at a limited number of locations. In order to obtain approximations or
predictions of fine-scale solutions over general regions of interest, we
propose to learn the operator mapping from coarse-scale solutions to fine-scale
solutions using a limited number (and possibly noisy) observations of the
fine-scale solutions. The approach is to train multi-fidelity homogenization
maps using mathematically motivated neural operators. The operator learning
framework can efficiently obtain the solution of multiscale PDEs at any
arbitrary point, making our proposed framework a mesh-free solver. We verify
our results on multiple numerical examples showing that our approach is an
efficient mesh-free solver for multiscale PDEs.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has shown remarkable
progress in generating realistic images. However, in this paper, we take a step
"backward" and address AIGC for the most rudimentary visual modality of human
sketches. Our objective is on the creative nature of sketches, and that
creative sketching should take the form of an interactive process. We further
enable text to drive the sketch ideation process, allowing creativity to be
freely defined, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of "I can't
sketch". We present a method to generate controlled sketches using a
text-conditioned diffusion model trained on pixel representations of images.
Our proposed approach, referred to as SketchDreamer, integrates a
differentiable rasteriser of Bezier curves that optimises an initial input to
distil abstract semantic knowledge from a pretrained diffusion model. We
utilise Score Distillation Sampling to learn a sketch that aligns with a given
caption, which importantly enable both text and sketch to interact with the
ideation process. Our objective is to empower non-professional users to create
sketches and, through a series of optimisation processes, transform a narrative
into a storyboard by expanding the text prompt while making minor adjustments
to the sketch input. Through this work, we hope to aspire the way we create
visual content, democratise the creative process, and inspire further research
in enhancing human creativity in AIGC. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We argue that the relative success of large language models (LLMs) is not a
reflection on the symbolic vs. subsymbolic debate but a reflection on employing
an appropriate strategy of bottom-up reverse engineering of language at scale.
However, due to the subsymbolic nature of these models whatever knowledge these
systems acquire about language will always be buried in millions of
microfeatures (weights) none of which is meaningful on its own. Moreover, and
due to their stochastic nature, these models will often fail in capturing
various inferential aspects that are prevalent in natural language. What we
suggest here is employing the successful bottom-up strategy in a symbolic
setting, producing symbolic, language agnostic and ontologically grounded large
language models.

<p class="mathjax">The transition to agile manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and high-mix-low-volume
tasks require robot programming solutions that are flexible. However, most
deployed robot solutions are still statically programmed and use stiff position
control, which limit their usefulness. In this paper, we show how a single
robot skill that utilizes knowledge representation, task planning, and
automatic selection of skill implementations based on the input parameters can
be executed in different contexts. We demonstrate how the skill-based control
platform enables this with contact-rich wiping tasks on different robot
systems. To achieve that in this case study, our approach needs to address
different kinematics, gripper types, vendors, and fundamentally different
control interfaces. We conducted the experiments with a mobile platform that
has a Universal Robots UR5e 6 degree-of-freedom robot arm with position control
and a 7 degree-of-freedom KUKA iiwa with torque control.

<p class="mathjax">App reviews reflect various user requirements that can aid in planning
maintenance tasks. Recently, proposed approaches for automatically classifying
user reviews rely on machine learning algorithms. Devine et al. demonstrated
that models trained on existing labeled datasets exhibit poor performance when
predicting new ones. Although integrating datasets improves the results to some
extent, there is still a need for greater generalizability to be taken into
consideration. Therefore, a comprehensive labeled dataset is essential to train
a more precise model. This paper introduces an approach to train a more
generalizable model by leveraging information from an additional source, such
as the GitHub issue tracking system, that contains valuable information about
user requirements. We propose an approach that assists in augmenting labeled
datasets by utilizing information extracted from GitHub issues. First, we
identify issues concerning review intentions (bug reports, feature requests,
and others) by examining the issue labels. Then, we analyze issue bodies and
define 19 language patterns for extracting targeted information. Finally, we
augment the manually labeled review dataset with a subset of processed issues
through the Within-App, Within-Context, and Between-App Analysis methods. The
first two methods train the app-specific models, and the last suits the
general-purpose models. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the
proposed approach. Our results demonstrate that using labeled issues for data
augmentation can improve the F1-score and recall to 13.9 and 29.9 in the bug
reports, respectively, and to 7.5 and 13.5 for feature requests. Furthermore,
we identify an effective volume range of 0.3 to 0.7, which provides better
performance improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment, requires
early detection and treatment. Developing robust AI models for DR
classification holds substantial potential, but a key challenge is ensuring
their generalization in unfamiliar domains with varying data distributions. To
address this, our paper investigates cross-domain generalization, also known as
domain generalization (DG), within the context of DR classification. DG, a
challenging problem in the medical domain, is complicated by the difficulty of
gathering labeled data across different domains, such as patient demographics
and disease stages. Some recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using
CLIP to handle the DG problem in natural images. In this study, we investigate
CLIP's transfer learning capabilities and its potential for cross-domain
generalization in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. We carry out
comprehensive experiments to assess the efficacy and potential of CLIP in
addressing DG for DR classification. Further, we introduce a multi-modal
fine-tuning strategy named Context Optimization with Learnable Visual Tokens
(CoOpLVT), which enhances context optimization by conditioning on visual
features. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method increases the
F1-score by 1.8% over the baseline, thus underlining its promise for effective
DG in DR classification. Our code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">In the field of financial fraud detection, understanding the underlying
patterns and dynamics is important to ensure effective and reliable systems.
This research introduces a new technique, "TimeTrail," which employs advanced
temporal correlation analysis to explain complex financial fraud patterns. The
technique leverages time-related insights to provide transparent and
interpretable explanations for fraud detection decisions, enhancing
accountability and trust.
<br />The "TimeTrail" methodology consists of three key phases: temporal data
enrichment, dynamic correlation analysis, and interpretable pattern
visualization. Initially, raw financial transaction data is enriched with
temporal attributes. Dynamic correlations between these attributes are then
quantified using innovative statistical measures. Finally, a unified
visualization framework presents these correlations in an interpretable manner.
To validate the effectiveness of "TimeTrail," a study is conducted on a diverse
financial dataset, surrounding various fraud scenarios. Results demonstrate the
technique's capability to uncover hidden temporal correlations and patterns,
performing better than conventional methods in both accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, a case study showcasing the application of
"TimeTrail" in real-world scenarios highlights its utility for fraud detection.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning provides many powerful and effective techniques for
analysing heterogeneous electronic health records (EHR). Administrative Health
Records (AHR) are a subset of EHR collected for administrative purposes, and
the use of machine learning on AHRs is a growing subfield of EHR analytics.
Existing reviews of EHR analytics emphasise that the data-modality of the EHR
limits the breadth of suitable machine learning techniques, and pursuable
healthcare applications. Despite emphasising the importance of data modality,
the literature fails to analyse which techniques and applications are relevant
to AHRs. AHRs contain uniquely well-structured, categorically encoded records
which are distinct from other data-modalities captured by EHRs, and they can
provide valuable information pertaining to how patients interact with the
healthcare system.
<br />This paper systematically reviews AHR-based research, analysing 70 relevant
studies and spanning multiple databases. We identify and analyse which machine
learning techniques are applied to AHRs and which health informatics
applications are pursued in AHR-based research. We also analyse how these
techniques are applied in pursuit of each application, and identify the
limitations of these approaches. We find that while AHR-based studies are
disconnected from each other, the use of AHRs in health informatics research is
substantial and accelerating. Our synthesis of these studies highlights the
utility of AHRs for pursuing increasingly complex and diverse research
objectives despite a number of pervading data- and technique-based limitations.
Finally, through our findings, we propose a set of future research directions
that can enhance the utility of AHR data and machine learning techniques for
health informatics research.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the application of active learning strategies to
adaptively learn Sobol indices for global sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate
that active learning for Sobol indices poses unique challenges due to the
definition of the Sobol index as a ratio of variances estimated from Gaussian
process surrogates. Consequently, learning strategies must either focus on
convergence in the numerator or the denominator of this ratio. However, rapid
convergence in either one does not guarantee convergence in the Sobol index. We
propose a novel strategy for active learning that focuses on resolving the main
effects of the Gaussian process (associated with the numerator of the Sobol
index) and compare this with existing strategies based on convergence in the
total variance (the denominator of the Sobol index). The new strategy,
implemented through a new learning function termed the MUSIC (minimize
uncertainty in Sobol index convergence), generally converges in Sobol index
error more rapidly than the existing strategies based on the Expected
Improvement for Global Fit (EIGF) and the Variance Improvement for Global Fit
(VIGF). Both strategies are compared with simple sequential random sampling and
the MUSIC learning function generally converges most rapidly for
low-dimensional problems. However, for high-dimensional problems, the
performance is comparable to random sampling. The new learning strategy is
demonstrated for a practical case of adaptive experimental design for
large-scale Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Shadows often occur when we capture the documents with casual equipment,
which influences the visual quality and readability of the digital copies.
Different from the algorithms for natural shadow removal, the algorithms in
document shadow removal need to preserve the details of fonts and figures in
high-resolution input. Previous works ignore this problem and remove the
shadows via approximate attention and small datasets, which might not work in
real-world situations. We handle high-resolution document shadow removal
directly via a larger-scale real-world dataset and a carefully designed
frequency-aware network. As for the dataset, we acquire over 7k couples of
high-resolution (2462 x 3699) images of real-world document pairs with various
samples under different lighting circumstances, which is 10 times larger than
existing datasets. As for the design of the network, we decouple the
high-resolution images in the frequency domain, where the low-frequency details
and high-frequency boundaries can be effectively learned via the carefully
designed network structure. Powered by our network and dataset, the proposed
method clearly shows a better performance than previous methods in terms of
visual quality and numerical results. The code, models, and dataset are

<p class="mathjax">This note shows how to compute, to high relative accuracy under mild
assumptions, complex Jacobi rotations for diagonalization of Hermitian matrices
of order two, using the correctly rounded functions $\mathtt{cr\_hypot}$ and
$\mathtt{cr\_rsqrt}$, proposed for standardization in the C programming
language as recommended by the IEEE-754 floating-point standard. The rounding
to nearest (ties to even) and the non-stop arithmetic are assumed. The
numerical examples compare the observed with theoretical bounds on the relative
errors in the rotations' elements, and show that the maximal observed departure
of the rotations' determinants from unity is smaller than that of the
transformations computed by LAPACK.

<p class="mathjax">Developing a thorough understanding of the target audience (and/or single
individuals) is a key factor for success - which is exceptionally important and
powerful for the domain of video games that can not only benefit from informed
decision making during development, but ideally even tailor game content,
difficulty and player experience while playing. The granular assessment of
individual personality and differences across players is a particularly
difficult endeavor, given the highly variant human nature, disagreement in
psychological background models and because of the effortful data collection
that most often builds upon long, time-consuming and deterrent questionnaires.
In this work, we explore possibilities to predict a series of player
personality questionnaire metrics from recorded in-game behavior and extend
related work by explicitly adding affective dialog decisions to the game
environment which could elevate the model's accuracy. Using random forest
regression, we predicted a wide variety of personality metrics from seven
established questionnaires across 62 players over 60 minute gameplay of a
customized version of the role-playing game Fallout: New Vegas. While some
personality variables could already be identified from reasonable underlying
in-game actions and affective expressions, we did not find ways to predict
others or encountered questionable correlations that could not be justified by
theoretical background literature. Yet, building on the initial opportunities
of this explorative study, we are striving to massively enlarge our data set to
players from an ecologically valid industrial game environment and investigate
the performance of more sophisticated machine learning approaches.

<p class="mathjax">A standard assumption in the design of ultra-reliable low-latency
communication systems is that the duration between message arrivals is larger
than the number of channel uses before the decoding deadline. Nevertheless,
this assumption fails when messages arrive rapidly and reliability constraints
require that the number of channel uses exceed the time between arrivals. In
this paper, we consider a broadcast setting in which a transmitter wishes to
send two different messages to two receivers over Gaussian channels. Messages
have different arrival times and decoding deadlines such that their
transmission windows overlap. For this setting, we propose a coding scheme that
exploits Marton's coding strategy. We derive rigorous bounds on the achievable
rate regions. Those bounds can be easily employed in point-to-point settings
with one or multiple parallel channels. In the point-to-point setting with one
or multiple parallel channels, the proposed achievability scheme outperforms
the Normal Approximation, especially when the number of channel uses is smaller
than $200$. In the broadcast setting, our scheme agrees with Marton's strategy
for sufficiently large numbers of channel uses and shows significant
performance improvements over standard approaches based on time sharing for
transmission of short packets.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the data-driven reconstruction of firing rate dynamics of
brain activity described by linear-threshold network models. Identifying the
system parameters directly leads to a large number of variables and a highly
non-convex objective function. Instead, our approach introduces a novel
reformulation that incorporates biological organizational features and turns
the identification problem into a scalar variable optimization of a
discontinuous, non-convex objective function. We prove that the minimizer of
the objective function is unique and establish that the solution of the
optimization problem leads to the identification of all the desired system
parameters. These results are the basis to introduce an algorithm to find the
optimizer by searching the different regions corresponding to the domain of
definition of the objective function. To deal with measurement noise in sampled
data, we propose a modification of the original algorithm whose identification
error is linearly bounded by the magnitude of the measurement noise. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through simulations on
synthetic and experimental data.

<p class="mathjax">Robots capable of performing manipulation tasks in a broad range of missions
in unstructured environments can develop numerous applications to impact and
enhance human life. Existing work in robot learning has shown success in
applying conventional machine learning algorithms to enable robots for
replicating rather simple manipulation tasks in manufacturing, service and
healthcare applications, among others. However, learning robust and versatile
models for complex manipulation tasks that are inherently multi-faceted and
naturally intricate demands algorithmic advancements in robot learning. Our
research supports the long-term goal of making robots more accessible and
serviceable to the general public by expanding robot applications to real-world
scenarios that require systems capable of performing complex tasks. To achieve
this goal, we focus on identifying and investigating knowledge gaps in robot
learning of complex manipulation tasks by leveraging upon human-robot
interaction and robot learning from human instructions. This document presents
an overview of the recent research developments in the Persistent Autonomy and
Robot Learning (PeARL) lab at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Here, I
briefly discuss different research directions, and present a few proposed
approaches in our most recent publications. For each proposed approach, I then
mention potential future directions that can advance the field.

<p class="mathjax">Findings from graphical perception can guide visualization recommendation
algorithms in identifying effective visualization designs. However, existing
algorithms use knowledge from, at best, a few studies, limiting our
understanding of how complementary (or contradictory) graphical perception
results influence generated recommendations. In this paper, we present a
pipeline of applying a large body of graphical perception results to develop
new visualization recommendation algorithms and conduct an exploratory study to
investigate how results from graphical perception can alter the behavior of
downstream algorithms. Specifically, we model graphical perception results from
30 papers in Draco -- a framework to model visualization knowledge -- to
develop new recommendation algorithms. By analyzing Draco-generated algorithms,
we showcase the feasibility of our method to (1) identify gaps in existing
graphical perception literature informing recommendation algorithms, (2)
cluster papers by their preferred design rules and constraints, and (3)
investigate why certain studies can dominate Draco's recommendations, whereas
others may have little influence. Given our findings, we discuss the potential
for mutually reinforcing advancements in graphical perception and visualization
recommendation research.

<p class="mathjax">The prevalent use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated studying
their mental models, yielding noteworthy theoretical and practical
implications. Current research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs,
such as ChatGPT, exhibit certain theory of mind capabilities and possess
relatively stable Big Five and/or MBTI personality traits. In addition,
cognitive process features form an essential component of these mental models.
Research in cultural psychology indicated significant differences in the
cognitive processes of Eastern and Western people when processing information
and making judgments. While Westerners predominantly exhibit analytical
thinking that isolates things from their environment to analyze their nature
independently, Easterners often showcase holistic thinking, emphasizing
relationships and adopting a global viewpoint. In our research, we probed the
cultural cognitive traits of ChatGPT. We employed two scales that directly
measure the cognitive process: the Analysis-Holism Scale (AHS) and the Triadic
Categorization Task (TCT). Additionally, we used two scales that investigate
the value differences shaped by cultural thinking: the Dialectical Self Scale
(DSS) and the Self-construal Scale (SCS). In cognitive process tests (AHS/TCT),
ChatGPT consistently tends towards Eastern holistic thinking, but regarding
value judgments (DSS/SCS), ChatGPT does not significantly lean towards the East
or the West. We suggest that the result could be attributed to both the
training paradigm and the training data in LLM development. We discuss the
potential value of this finding for AI research and directions for future
research.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion-based image generators can now produce high-quality and diverse
samples, but their success has yet to fully translate to 3D generation:
existing diffusion methods can either generate low-resolution but 3D consistent
outputs, or detailed 2D views of 3D objects but with potential structural
defects and lacking view consistency or realism. We present HoloFusion, a
method that combines the best of these approaches to produce high-fidelity,
plausible, and diverse 3D samples while learning from a collection of
multi-view 2D images only. The method first generates coarse 3D samples using a
variant of the recently proposed HoloDiffusion generator. Then, it
independently renders and upsamples a large number of views of the coarse 3D
model, super-resolves them to add detail, and distills those into a single,
high-fidelity implicit 3D representation, which also ensures view consistency
of the final renders. The super-resolution network is trained as an integral
part of HoloFusion, end-to-end, and the final distillation uses a new sampling
scheme to capture the space of super-resolved signals. We compare our method
against existing baselines, including DreamFusion, Get3D, EG3D, and
HoloDiffusion, and achieve, to the best of our knowledge, the most realistic
results on the challenging CO3Dv2 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Studies have shown the potential adverse health effects, ranging
from headaches to cardiovascular disease, associated with long-term negative
emotions and chronic stress. Since many indicators of stress are imperceptible
to observers, the early detection and intervention of stress remains a pressing
medical need. Physiological signals offer a non-invasive method of monitoring
emotions and are easily collected by smartwatches. Existing research primarily
focuses on developing generalized machine learning-based models for emotion
classification. Objective: We aim to study the differences between personalized
and generalized machine learning models for three-class emotion classification
(neutral, stress, and amusement) using wearable biosignal data. Methods: We
developed a convolutional encoder for the three-class emotion classification
problem using data from WESAD, a multimodal dataset with physiological signals
for 15 subjects. We compared the results between a subject-exclusive
generalized, subject-inclusive generalized, and personalized model. Results:
For the three-class classification problem, our personalized model achieved an
average accuracy of 95.06% and F1-score of 91.71, our subject-inclusive
generalized model achieved an average accuracy of 66.95% and F1-score of 42.50,
and our subject-exclusive generalized model achieved an average accuracy of
67.65% and F1-score of 43.05. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the need for
increased research in personalized emotion recognition models given that they
outperform generalized models in certain contexts. We also demonstrate that
personalized machine learning models for emotion classification are viable and
can achieve high performance.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) promises immense benefits across sectors, yet
also poses risks from dual-use potentials, biases, and unintended behaviors.
This paper reviews emerging issues with opaque and uncontrollable AI systems
and proposes an integrative framework called violet teaming to develop reliable
and responsible AI. Violet teaming combines adversarial vulnerability probing
(red teaming) with solutions for safety and security (blue teaming) while
prioritizing ethics and social benefit. It emerged from AI safety research to
manage risks proactively by design. The paper traces the evolution of red,
blue, and purple teaming toward violet teaming, and then discusses applying
violet techniques to address biosecurity risks of AI in biotechnology.
Additional sections review key perspectives across law, ethics, cybersecurity,
macrostrategy, and industry best practices essential for operationalizing
responsible AI through holistic technical and social considerations. Violet
teaming provides both philosophy and method for steering AI trajectories toward
societal good. With conscience and wisdom, the extraordinary capabilities of AI
can enrich humanity. But without adequate precaution, the risks could prove

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancement in personalized image generation have unveiled the
intriguing capability of pre-trained text-to-image models on learning identity
information from a collection of portrait images. However, existing solutions
can be vulnerable in producing truthful details, and usually suffer from
several defects such as (i) The generated face exhibit its own unique
characteristics, \ie facial shape and facial feature positioning may not
resemble key characteristics of the input, and (ii) The synthesized face may
contain warped, blurred or corrupted regions. In this paper, we present
FaceChain, a personalized portrait generation framework that combines a series
of customized image-generation model and a rich set of face-related perceptual
understanding models (\eg, face detection, deep face embedding extraction, and
facial attribute recognition), to tackle aforementioned challenges and to
generate truthful personalized portraits, with only a handful of portrait
images as input. Concretely, we inject several SOTA face models into the
generation procedure, achieving a more efficient label-tagging,
data-processing, and model post-processing compared to previous solutions, such
as DreamBooth ~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth} , InstantBooth
~\cite{shi2023instantbooth} , or other LoRA-only approaches ~\cite{hu2021lora}
. Through the development of FaceChain, we have identified several potential
directions to accelerate development of Face/Human-Centric AIGC research and
application. We have designed FaceChain as a framework comprised of pluggable
components that can be easily adjusted to accommodate different styles and
personalized needs. We hope it can grow to serve the burgeoning needs from the
communities. FaceChain is open-sourced under Apache-2.0 license at

<p class="mathjax">Mosaic Flow is a novel domain decomposition method designed to scale
physics-informed neural PDE solvers to large domains. Its unique approach
leverages pre-trained networks on small domains to solve partial differential
equations on large domains purely through inference, resulting in high
reusability. This paper presents an end-to-end parallelization of Mosaic Flow,
combining data parallel training and domain parallelism for inference on
large-scale problems. By optimizing the network architecture and data parallel
training, we significantly reduce the training time for learning the Laplacian
operator to minutes on 32 GPUs. Moreover, our distributed domain decomposition
algorithm enables scalable inferences for solving the Laplace equation on
domains 4096 times larger than the training domain, demonstrating strong
scaling while maintaining accuracy on 32 GPUs. The reusability of Mosaic Flow,
combined with the improved performance achieved through the distributed-memory
algorithms, makes it a promising tool for modeling complex physical phenomena
and accelerating scientific discovery.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is concerned with a search-number-reduced guessing random additive
noise decoding (GRAND) algorithm for linear block codes, called partially
constrained GRAND (PC-GRAND). In contrast to the original GRAND, which guesses
error patterns without constraints, the PC-GRAND guesses only those error
patterns satisfying partial constraints of the codes. In particular, the
PC-GRAND takes partial rows of the parity-check matrix as constraints for
generating candidate error patterns and the remaining rows as checks for
validating the candidates. The number of searches can be reduced when the
serial list Viterbi algorithm (SLVA) is implemented for searching over a
trellis specified by the partial parity-check matrix. This is confirmed by
numerical results. Numerical simulations are also provided for comparison with
other decoding algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">With the exponential surge in diverse multi-modal data, traditional uni-modal
retrieval methods struggle to meet the needs of users demanding access to data
from various modalities. To address this, cross-modal retrieval has emerged,
enabling interaction across modalities, facilitating semantic matching, and
leveraging complementarity and consistency between different modal data.
Although prior literature undertook a review of the cross-modal retrieval
field, it exhibits numerous deficiencies pertaining to timeliness, taxonomy,
and comprehensiveness. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of
cross-modal retrieval's evolution, spanning from shallow statistical analysis
techniques to vision-language pre-training models. Commencing with a
comprehensive taxonomy grounded in machine learning paradigms, mechanisms, and
models, the paper then delves deeply into the principles and architectures
underpinning existing cross-modal retrieval methods. Furthermore, it offers an
overview of widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances. Lastly, the
paper probes the prospects and challenges that confront contemporary
cross-modal retrieval, while engaging in a discourse on potential directions
for further progress in the field. To facilitate the research on cross-modal
retrieval, we develop an open-source code repository at
https://github.com/BMC-SDNU/Cross-Modal-Retrieval.

<p class="mathjax">In recent research on dialogue systems and corpora, there has been a
significant focus on two distinct categories: task-oriented (TOD) and
open-domain (chit-chat) dialogues. TOD systems aim to satisfy specific user
goals, such as finding a movie to watch, whereas open-domain systems primarily
focus on generating engaging conversations. A recent study by Chiu et al.
(2022) introduced SalesBot, which provides simulators and a dataset with
one-turn transition from chit-chat to task-oriented dialogues. However, the
previously generated data solely relied on BlenderBot, which raised concerns
about its long-turn naturalness and consistency during a conversation. To
address this issue, this paper aims to build SalesBot 2.0, a revised version of
the published data, by leveraging the commonsense knowledge of large language
models (LLMs) through proper prompting. The objective is to gradually bridge
the gap between chit-chat and TOD towards better naturalness and consistency.
The newly released large-scale dataset with detailed annotations exhibits
smoother transitions between topics and is more human-like in terms of
naturalness and consistency. It can serve as a valuable resource for both
academic research and commercial applications. Furthermore, our proposed
framework can be applied to generate numerous dialogues with various target
intents.

<p class="mathjax">The long-term goal of machine learning is to learn general visual
representations from a small amount of data without supervision, mimicking
three advantages of human cognition: i) no need for labels, ii) robustness to
data scarcity, and iii) learning from experience. Self-supervised learning and
meta-learning are two promising techniques to achieve this goal, but they both
only partially capture the advantages and fail to address all the problems.
Self-supervised learning struggles to overcome the drawbacks of data scarcity,
while ignoring prior knowledge that can facilitate learning and generalization.
Meta-learning relies on supervised information and suffers from a bottleneck of
insufficient learning. To address these issues, we propose a novel Bootstrapped
Meta Self-Supervised Learning (BMSSL) framework that aims to simulate the human
learning process. We first analyze the close relationship between meta-learning
and self-supervised learning. Based on this insight, we reconstruct tasks to
leverage the strengths of both paradigms, achieving advantages i and ii.
Moreover, we employ a bi-level optimization framework that alternates between
solving specific tasks with a learned ability (first level) and improving this
ability (second level), attaining advantage iii. To fully harness its power, we
introduce a bootstrapped target based on meta-gradient to make the model its
own teacher. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with comprehensive
theoretical and empirical study.

<p class="mathjax">Past research has clearly established that music can affect mood and that
mood affects emotional and cognitive processing, and thus decision-making. It
follows that if a robot interacting with a person needs to predict the person's
behavior, knowledge of the music the person is listening to when acting is a
potentially relevant feature. To date, however, there has not been any concrete
evidence that a robot can improve its human-interactive decision-making by
taking into account what the person is listening to. This research fills this
gap by reporting the results of an experiment in which human participants were
required to complete a task in the presence of an autonomous agent while
listening to background music. Specifically, the participants drove a simulated
car through an intersection while listening to music. The intersection was not
empty, as another simulated vehicle, controlled autonomously, was also crossing
the intersection in a different direction. Our results clearly indicate that
such background information can be effectively incorporated in an agent's world
representation in order to better predict people's behavior. We subsequently
analyze how knowledge of music impacted both participant behavior and the
resulting learned policy.\setcounter{footnote}{2}\footnote{An earlier version

<p class="mathjax">Despite the rising popularity of saliency-based explanations, the research
community remains at an impasse, facing doubts concerning their purpose,
efficacy, and tendency to contradict each other. Seeking to unite the
community's efforts around common goals, several recent works have proposed
evaluation metrics. In this paper, we critically examine two sets of metrics:
the ERASER metrics (comprehensiveness and sufficiency) and the EVAL-X metrics,
focusing our inquiry on natural language processing. First, we show that we can
inflate a model's comprehensiveness and sufficiency scores dramatically without
altering its predictions or explanations on in-distribution test inputs. Our
strategy exploits the tendency for extracted explanations and their complements
to be "out-of-support" relative to each other and in-distribution inputs. Next,
we demonstrate that the EVAL-X metrics can be inflated arbitrarily by a simple
method that encodes the label, even though EVAL-X is precisely motivated to
address such exploits. Our results raise doubts about the ability of current
metrics to guide explainability research, underscoring the need for a broader
reassessment of what precisely these metrics are intended to capture.

<p class="mathjax">The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has been widely used in various unimodal
and multimodal tasks. However, finetuning all the parameters of a pre-trained
model becomes prohibitive as the model size grows exponentially. To address
this issue, the adapter mechanism that freezes the pre-trained model and only
finetunes a few extra parameters is introduced and delivers promising results.
Most studies on adapter architectures are dedicated to unimodal or bimodal
tasks, while the adapter architectures for trimodal tasks have not been
investigated yet. This paper introduces a novel Long Short-Term Trimodal
Adapter (LSTTA) approach for video understanding tasks involving audio, visual,
and language modalities. Based on the pre-trained from the three modalities,
the designed adapter module is inserted between the sequential blocks to model
the dense interactions across the three modalities. Specifically, LSTTA
consists of two types of complementary adapter modules, namely the long-term
semantic filtering module and the short-term semantic interaction module. The
long-term semantic filtering aims to characterize the temporal importance of
the video frames and the short-term semantic interaction module models local
interactions within short periods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
trimodal learning methods pre-trained on a large-scale trimodal corpus, LSTTA
is more flexible and can inherit any powerful unimodal or bimodal models.
Experimental results on four typical trimodal learning tasks show the
effectiveness of LSTTA over existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Micro-videos platforms such as TikTok are extremely popular nowadays. One
important feature is that users no longer select interested videos from a set,
instead they either watch the recommended video or skip to the next one. As a
result, the time length of users' watching behavior becomes the most important
signal for identifying preferences. However, our empirical data analysis has
shown a video-length effect that long videos are easier to receive a higher
value of average view time, thus adopting such view-time labels for measuring
user preferences can easily induce a biased model that favors the longer
videos. In this paper, we propose a Video Length Debiasing Recommendation
(VLDRec) method to alleviate such an effect for micro-video recommendation.
VLDRec designs the data labeling approach and the sample generation module that
better capture user preferences in a view-time oriented manner. It further
leverages the multi-task learning technique to jointly optimize the above
samples with original biased ones. Extensive experiments show that VLDRec can
improve the users' view time by 1.81% and 11.32% on two real-world datasets,
given a recommendation list of a fixed overall video length, compared with the
best baseline method. Moreover, VLDRec is also more effective in matching
users' interests in terms of the video content.

<p class="mathjax">The advancements in vision-based tactile sensors have boosted the aptitude of
robots to perform contact-rich manipulation, particularly when precise
positioning and contact state of the manipulated objects are crucial for
successful execution. In this work, we present 9DTact, a straightforward yet
versatile tactile sensor that offers 3D shape reconstruction and 6D force
estimation capabilities. Conceptually, 9DTact is designed to be highly compact,
robust, and adaptable to various robotic platforms. Moreover, it is low-cost
and DIY-friendly, requiring minimal assembly skills. Functionally, 9DTact
builds upon the optical principles of DTact and is optimized to achieve 3D
shape reconstruction with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Remarkably, we
leverage the optical and deformable properties of the translucent gel so that
9DTact can perform 6D force estimation without the participation of auxiliary
markers or patterns on the gel surface. More specifically, we collect a dataset
consisting of approximately 100,000 image-force pairs from 175 complex objects
and train a neural network to regress the 6D force, which can generalize to
unseen objects. To promote the development and applications of vision-based
tactile sensors, we open-source both the hardware and software of 9DTact as
well as present a 1-hour video tutorial.

<p class="mathjax">Graph sampling plays an important role in data mining for large networks.
Specifically, larger networks often correspond to lower sampling rates. Under
the situation, traditional traversal-based samplings for large networks usually
have an excessive preference for densely-connected network core nodes. Aim at
this issue, this paper proposes a sampling method for unknown networks at low
sampling rates, called SLSR, which first adopts a random node sampling to
evaluate a degree threshold, utilized to distinguish the core from periphery,
and the average degree in unknown networks, and then runs a double-layer
sampling strategy on the core and periphery. SLSR is simple and has a high time
efficiency, but experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed method can
accurately preserve many critical structures of unknown large networks at
sampling rates not exceeding 10%.

<p class="mathjax">The Fon language, spoken by an average 2 million of people, is a truly
low-resourced African language, with a limited online presence, and existing
datasets (just to name but a few). Multitask learning is a learning paradigm
that aims to improve the generalization capacity of a model by sharing
knowledge across different but related tasks: this could be prevalent in very
data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we present the first explorative approach
to multitask learning, for model capabilities enhancement in Natural Language
Processing for the Fon language. Specifically, we explore the tasks of Named
Entity Recognition (NER) and Part of Speech Tagging (POS) for Fon. We leverage
two language model heads as encoders to build shared representations for the
inputs, and we use linear layers blocks for classification relative to each
task. Our results on the NER and POS tasks for Fon, show competitive (or
better) performances compared to several multilingual pretrained language
models finetuned on single tasks. Additionally, we perform a few ablation
studies to leverage the efficiency of two different loss combination strategies
and find out that the equal loss weighting approach works best in our case. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/bonaventuredossou/multitask_fon.

<p class="mathjax">Numerous solutions are proposed for the Traffic Signal Control (TSC) tasks
aiming to provide efficient transportation and mitigate congestion waste. In
recent, promising results have been attained by Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods through trial and error in simulators, bringing confidence in solving
cities' congestion headaches. However, there still exist performance gaps when
simulator-trained policies are deployed to the real world. This issue is mainly
introduced by the system dynamic difference between the training simulator and
the real-world environments. The Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on
mass knowledge and proved to be equipped with astonishing inference abilities.
In this work, we leverage LLMs to understand and profile the system dynamics by
a prompt-based grounded action transformation. Accepting the cloze prompt
template, and then filling in the answer based on accessible context, the
pre-trained LLM's inference ability is exploited and applied to understand how
weather conditions, traffic states, and road types influence traffic dynamics,
being aware of this, the policies' action is taken and grounded based on
realistic dynamics, thus help the agent learn a more realistic policy. We
conduct experiments using DQN to show the effectiveness of the proposed
PromptGAT's ability in mitigating the performance gap from simulation to
reality (sim-to-real).

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown potential for learning compact models
in dense object detection. However, the commonly used softmax-based
distillation ignores the absolute classification scores for individual
categories. Thus, the optimum of the distillation loss does not necessarily
lead to the optimal student classification scores for dense object detectors.
This cross-task protocol inconsistency is critical, especially for dense object
detectors, since the foreground categories are extremely imbalanced. To address
the issue of protocol differences between distillation and classification, we
propose a novel distillation method with cross-task consistent protocols,
tailored for the dense object detection. For classification distillation, we
address the cross-task protocol inconsistency problem by formulating the
classification logit maps in both teacher and student models as multiple
binary-classification maps and applying a binary-classification distillation
loss to each map. For localization distillation, we design an IoU-based
Localization Distillation Loss that is free from specific network structures
and can be compared with existing localization distillation losses. Our
proposed method is simple but effective, and experimental results demonstrate
its superiority over existing methods. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Traffic light control is important for reducing congestion in urban mobility
systems. This paper proposes a real-time traffic light control method using
deep Q learning. Our approach incorporates a reward function considering queue
lengths, delays, travel time, and throughput. The model dynamically decides
phase changes based on current traffic conditions. The training of the deep Q
network involves an offline stage from pre-generated data with fixed schedules
and an online stage using real-time traffic data. A deep Q network structure
with a "phase gate" component is used to simplify the model's learning task
under different phases. A "memory palace" mechanism is used to address sample
imbalance during the training process. We validate our approach using both
synthetic and real-world traffic flow data on a road intersecting in Hangzhou,
China. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements of the proposed
method in reducing vehicle waiting time (57.1% to 100%), queue lengths (40.9%
to 100%), and total travel time (16.8% to 68.0%) compared to traditional fixed
signal plans.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in instructing Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize
external tools and execute multi-step plans have significantly enhanced their
ability to solve intricate tasks, ranging from mathematical problems to
creative writing. Yet, there remains a notable gap in studying the capacity of
LLMs in responding to personalized queries such as a recommendation request. To
bridge this gap, we have designed an LLM-powered autonomous recommender agent,
RecMind, which is capable of providing precise personalized recommendations
through careful planning, utilizing tools for obtaining external knowledge, and
leveraging individual data. We propose a novel algorithm, Self-Inspiring, to
improve the planning ability of the LLM agent. At each intermediate planning
step, the LLM 'self-inspires' to consider all previously explored states to
plan for next step. This mechanism greatly improves the model's ability to
comprehend and utilize historical planning information for recommendation. We
evaluate RecMind's performance in various recommendation scenarios, including
rating prediction, sequential recommendation, direct recommendation,
explanation generation, and review summarization. Our experiment shows that
RecMind outperforms existing zero/few-shot LLM-based recommendation methods in
different recommendation tasks and achieves competitive performance to a recent
model P5, which requires fully pre-train for the recommendation tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Initial orbit determination (IOD) is an important early step in the
processing chain that makes sense of and reconciles the multiple optical
observations of a resident space object. IOD methods generally operate on
line-of-sight (LOS) vectors extracted from images of the object, hence the LOS
vectors can be seen as discrete point samples of the raw optical measurements.
Typically, the number of LOS vectors used by an IOD method is much smaller than
the available measurements (\ie, the set of pixel intensity values), hence
current IOD methods arguably under-utilize the rich information present in the
data. In this paper, we propose a \emph{direct} IOD method called D-IOD that
fits the orbital parameters directly on the observed streak images, without
requiring LOS extraction. Since it does not utilize LOS vectors, D-IOD avoids
potential inaccuracies or errors due to an imperfect LOS extraction step. Two
innovations underpin our novel orbit-fitting paradigm: first, we introduce a
novel non-linear least-squares objective function that computes the loss
between the candidate-orbit-generated streak images and the observed streak
images. Second, the objective function is minimized with a gradient descent
approach that is embedded in our proposed optimization strategies designed for
streak images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of D-IOD on a variety of
simulated scenarios and challenging real streak images.

decisions made earlier impact a competitor's success in later stages. In this
paper, we study these dynamics in General Lotto games, a class of models
describing the competitive allocation of resources between two opposing
players. We propose a two-stage formulation where one of the players has
reserved resources that can be strategically pre-allocated across the
battlefields in the first stage of the game as reinforcements. The players then
simultaneously allocate their remaining real-time resources, which can be
randomized, in a decisive final stage. Our main contributions provide complete
characterizations of the optimal reinforcement strategies and resulting
equilibrium payoffs in these multi-stage General Lotto games. Interestingly, we
determine that real-time resources are at least twice as effective as
reinforcement resources when considering equilibrium payoffs.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Instruction fine-tuning has risen to prominence as a potential
method for enhancing the zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
on novel tasks. This technique has shown an exceptional ability to boost the
performance of moderately sized LLMs, sometimes even reaching performance
levels comparable to those of much larger model variants. The focus is on the
robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs to seen and unseen tasks. We conducted an
exploration of six models including Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM, and Traditional
Task-oriented Models(Flan-T5-XL/XXL, T0++) using real-world relation extraction
datasets as case studies. We carried out a comprehensive evaluation of these
instruction-following LLMs which have been tuned based on open-domain
instructions and task-oriented instructions. The main discussion is their
performance and robustness towards instructions. We have observed that in most
cases, the model's performance in dealing with unfamiliar instructions tends to
worsen significantly, and the robustness of the model for RE instructions
deteriorates compared to QA. Further, we discovered that up until a certain
parameter size threshold (3B), the performance of the FLAN-T5 model improves as
the parameter count increases. The robustness of different scales of FLAN-T5
models to RE instruction is worse than the robustness to QA instruction.

<p class="mathjax">The assumption that no LoS channels exist between wireless access
points~(APs) and user equipments~(UEs) becomes questionable in the context of
the recent developments in the direction of cell free massive multiple input
multiple output MIMO~(CF-mMIMO) systems. In CF-mMIMO systems, the access point
density is assumed to be comparable to, or much larger than the the user
density, thereby leading to the possibility of existence of LoS links between
the UEs and the APs, depending on the local propagation conditions. In this
paper, we compare the rates achievable by CF-mMIMO systems under probabilistic
LoS/ NLos channels, with and without acquiring the channel state
information~(CSI) of the fast fading components. We show that, under
sufficiently large AP densities, statistical beamforming that does not require
the knowledge about the fast fading components of the channels, performs almost
at par with full beamforming, utilizing the information about the fast fading
channel coefficients, thus potentially avoiding the need for training during
every frame. We validate our results via detailed Monte Carlo simulations, and
also elaborate the conditions under which statistical beamforming can be
successfully employed in massive MIMO systems with LoS/ NLoS channels.

<p class="mathjax">Standard cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods aim to
find the optimal team cooperative policy to complete a task. However there may
exist multiple different ways of cooperating, which usually are very needed by
domain experts. Therefore, identifying a set of significantly different
policies can alleviate the task complexity for them. Unfortunately, there is a
general lack of effective policy diversity approaches specifically designed for
the multi-agent domain. In this work, we propose a method called
Moment-Matching Policy Diversity to alleviate this problem. This method can
generate different team policies to varying degrees by formalizing the
difference between team policies as the difference in actions of selected
agents in different policies. Theoretically, we show that our method is a
simple way to implement a constrained optimization problem that regularizes the
difference between two trajectory distributions by using the maximum mean
discrepancy. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a challenging
team-based shooter.

<p class="mathjax">The spread of infectious diseases, rumors, and harmful speech in networks can
result in substantial losses, underscoring the significance of studying how to
suppress such hazardous events. However, previous studies often assume full
knowledge of the network structure, which is often not the case in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we address the challenge of controlling the
propagation of hazardous events by removing nodes when the network structure is
unknown. To tackle this problem, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement
learning method that drastically reduces the action space, making the problem
feasible to solve. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method over the baseline methods. Remarkably, even though the baseline methods
possess extensive knowledge of the network structure, while our method has no

<p class="mathjax">Domain shift is a commonly encountered issue in medical imaging solutions,
primarily caused by variations in imaging devices and data sources. To mitigate
this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques have been employed.
However, concerns regarding patient privacy and potential degradation of image
quality have led to an increased focus on source-free domain adaptation. In
this study, we address the issue of false labels in self-training based
source-free domain adaptive medical image segmentation methods. To correct
erroneous pseudo-labels, we propose a novel approach called the local-global
pseudo-label correction (LGDA) method for source-free domain adaptive medical
image segmentation. Our method consists of two components: An offline local
context-based pseudo-label correction method that utilizes local context
similarity in image space. And an online global pseudo-label correction method
based on class prototypes, which corrects erroneously predicted pseudo-labels
by considering the relative distance between pixel-wise feature vectors and
prototype vectors. We evaluate the performance of our method on three benchmark
fundus image datasets for optic disc and cup segmentation. Our method achieves
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, even without
using of any source data.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning pre-trained models has emerged as a powerful technique in
numerous domains, owing to its ability to leverage enormous pre-existing
knowledge and achieve remarkable performance on downstream tasks. However,
updating the parameters of entire networks is computationally intensive.
Although state-of-the-art parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods
significantly reduce the trainable parameters and storage demand, almost all of
them still need to back-propagate the gradients through large pre-trained
networks. This memory-extensive characteristic extremely limits the
applicability of PETL methods in real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose
a new memory-efficient PETL strategy, dubbed Universal Parallel Tuning (UniPT).
Specifically, we facilitate the transfer process via a lightweight learnable
parallel network, which consists of two modules: 1) A parallel interaction
module that decouples the inherently sequential connections and processes the
intermediate activations detachedly of the pre-trained network. 2) A confidence
aggregation module that learns optimal strategies adaptively for integrating
cross-layer features. We evaluate UniPT with different backbones (e.g.,
VSE$\infty$, CLIP4Clip, Clip-ViL, and MDETR) on five challenging
vision-and-language tasks (i.e., image-text retrieval, video-text retrieval,
visual question answering, compositional question answering, and visual
grounding). Extensive ablations on ten datasets have validated that our UniPT
can not only dramatically reduce memory consumption and outperform the best
memory-efficient competitor, but also achieve higher performance than existing
PETL methods in a low-memory scenario on different architectures. Our code is
publicly available at: https://github.com/Paranioar/UniPT.

<p class="mathjax">Music Emotion Recognition involves the automatic identification of emotional
elements within music tracks, and it has garnered significant attention due to
its broad applicability in the field of Music Information Retrieval. It can
also be used as the upstream task of many other human-related tasks such as
emotional music generation and music recommendation. Due to existing psychology
research, music emotion is determined by multiple factors such as the Timbre,
Velocity, and Structure of the music. Incorporating multiple factors in MER
helps achieve more interpretable and finer-grained methods. However, most prior
works were uni-domain and showed weak consistency between arousal modeling
performance and valence modeling performance. Based on this background, we
designed a multi-domain emotion modeling method for instrumental music that
combines symbolic analysis and acoustic analysis. At the same time, because of
the rarity of music data and the difficulty of labeling, our multi-domain
approach can make full use of limited data. Our approach was implemented and
assessed using the publicly available piano dataset EMOPIA, resulting in a
notable improvement over our baseline model with a 2.4% increase in overall
accuracy, establishing its state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">Voice conversion is a method that allows for the transformation of speaking
style while maintaining the integrity of linguistic information. There are many
researchers using deep generative models for voice conversion tasks. Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) can quickly generate high-quality samples, but the
generated samples lack diversity. The samples generated by the Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are better than GANs in terms of mode
coverage and sample diversity. But the DDPMs have high computational costs and
the inference speed is slower than GANs. In order to make GANs and DDPMs more
practical we proposes DiffGAN-VC, a variant of GANs and DDPMS, to achieve
non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion (VC). We use large steps to achieve
denoising, and also introduce a multimodal conditional GANs to model the
denoising diffusion generative adversarial network. According to both objective
and subjective evaluation experiments, DiffGAN-VC has been shown to achieve
high voice quality on non-parallel data sets. Compared with the CycleGAN-VC
method, DiffGAN-VC achieves speaker similarity, naturalness and higher sound
quality.

<p class="mathjax">Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and routine documentation practices play a
vital role in patients' daily care, providing a holistic record of health,
diagnoses, and treatment. However, complex and verbose EHR narratives overload
healthcare providers, risking diagnostic inaccuracies. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) have showcased their potential in diverse language tasks, their
application in the healthcare arena needs to ensure the minimization of
diagnostic errors and the prevention of patient harm. In this paper, we outline
an innovative approach for augmenting the proficiency of LLMs in the realm of
automated diagnosis generation, achieved through the incorporation of a medical
knowledge graph (KG) and a novel graph model: Dr.Knows, inspired by the
clinical diagnostic reasoning process. We derive the KG from the National
Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a robust
repository of biomedical knowledge. Our method negates the need for
pre-training and instead leverages the KG as an auxiliary instrument aiding in
the interpretation and summarization of complex medical concepts. Using
real-world hospital datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach of combining LLMs with KG has the potential to improve the
accuracy of automated diagnosis generation. More importantly, our approach
offers an explainable diagnostic pathway, edging us closer to the realization
of AI-augmented diagnostic decision support systems.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of the phenomenon of the "right to be forgotten" has prompted
research on machine unlearning, which grants data owners the right to actively
withdraw data that has been used for model training, and requires the
elimination of the contribution of that data to the model. A simple method to
achieve this is to use the remaining data to retrain the model, but this is not
acceptable for other data owners who continue to participate in training.
Existing machine unlearning methods have been found to be ineffective in
quickly removing knowledge from deep learning models. This paper proposes using
a stochastic network as a teacher to expedite the mitigation of the influence
caused by forgotten data on the model. We performed experiments on three
datasets, and the findings demonstrate that our approach can efficiently
mitigate the influence of target data on the model within a single epoch. This
allows for one-time erasure and reconstruction of the model, and the
reconstruction model achieves the same performance as the retrained model.

with physical education has focused on both teaching practice and the
feasibility of assessment. The object of assessment has shifted from multiple
ages to subdivided ages, while the content of assessment has changed from
complex and time-consuming to concise and efficient. Therefore, we apply deep
learning to physical fitness evaluation, we propose a system based on the
Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment (CAMSA) Physical Fitness
Evaluation System (CPFES), which evaluates children's physical fitness based on
CAMSA, and gives recommendations based on the scores obtained by CPFES to help
children grow. We have designed a landmark detection module and a pose

CAMSA criteria that can effectively evaluate the actions of the child being

13 different domains and analyzes the ontological dissonance of these domains.
Using a network graph, central data models and ontology attributes are
identified, while the semantic heterogeneity of these domains is described
qualitatively. The research outlook describes how these results help to connect
different Data Spaces across domains.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Generative AI has been a long-standing essential topic in the machine
learning community, which can impact a number of application areas like text
generation and computer vision. The major paradigm to train a generative model
is maximum likelihood estimation, which pushes the learner to capture and
approximate the target data distribution by decreasing the divergence between
the model distribution and the target distribution. This formulation
successfully establishes the objective of generative tasks, while it is
incapable of satisfying all the requirements that a user might expect from a
generative model. Reinforcement learning, serving as a competitive option to
inject new training signals by creating new objectives that exploit novel
signals, has demonstrated its power and flexibility to incorporate human
inductive bias from multiple angles, such as adversarial learning,
hand-designed rules and learned reward model to build a performant model.
Thereby, reinforcement learning has become a trending research field and has
stretched the limits of generative AI in both model design and application. It
is reasonable to summarize and conclude advances in recent years with a
comprehensive review. Although there are surveys in different application areas
recently, this survey aims to shed light on a high-level review that spans a
range of application areas. We provide a rigorous taxonomy in this area and
make sufficient coverage on various models and applications. Notably, we also
surveyed the fast-developing large language model area. We conclude this survey
by showing the potential directions that might tackle the limit of current
models and expand the frontiers for generative AI.

<p class="mathjax">In autonomous driving, the end-to-end (E2E) driving approach that predicts
vehicle control signals directly from sensor data is rapidly gaining attention.
To learn a safe E2E driving system, one needs an extensive amount of driving
data and human intervention. Vehicle control data is constructed by many hours
of human driving, and it is challenging to construct large vehicle control
datasets. Often, publicly available driving datasets are collected with limited
driving scenes, and collecting vehicle control data is only available by
vehicle manufacturers. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first self-supervised learning framework, self-supervised imitation learning
(SSIL), that can learn E2E driving networks without using driving command data.
To construct pseudo steering angle data, proposed SSIL predicts a pseudo target
from the vehicle's poses at the current and previous time points that are
estimated with light detection and ranging sensors. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SSIL framework achieves comparable E2E driving
accuracy with the supervised learning counterpart. In addition, our qualitative
analyses using a conventional visual explanation tool show that trained NNs by
proposed SSIL and the supervision counterpart attend similar objects in making
predictions.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR odometry estimation and 3D semantic segmentation are crucial for
autonomous driving, which has achieved remarkable advances recently. However,
these tasks are challenging due to the imbalance of points in different
semantic categories for 3D semantic segmentation and the influence of dynamic
objects for LiDAR odometry estimation, which increases the importance of using
representative/salient landmarks as reference points for robust feature
learning. To address these challenges, we propose a saliency-guided approach
that leverages attention information to improve the performance of LiDAR
odometry estimation and semantic segmentation models. Unlike in the image
domain, only a few studies have addressed point cloud saliency information due
to the lack of annotated training data. To alleviate this, we first present a
universal framework to transfer saliency distribution knowledge from color
images to point clouds, and use this to construct a pseudo-saliency dataset
(i.e. FordSaliency) for point clouds. Then, we adopt point cloud-based
backbones to learn saliency distribution from pseudo-saliency labels, which is
followed by our proposed SalLiDAR module. SalLiDAR is a saliency-guided 3D
semantic segmentation model that integrates saliency information to improve
segmentation performance. Finally, we introduce SalLONet, a self-supervised
saliency-guided LiDAR odometry network that uses the semantic and saliency
predictions of SalLiDAR to achieve better odometry estimation. Our extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SalLiDAR and
SalLONet models achieve state-of-the-art performance against existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of image-to-LiDAR saliency knowledge transfer.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have been leveraged to perform adversarial purification and
thus provide both empirical and certified robustness for a standard model. On
the other hand, different robustly trained smoothed models have been studied to
improve the certified robustness. Thus, it raises a natural question: Can
diffusion model be used to achieve improved certified robustness on those
robustly trained smoothed models? In this work, we first theoretically show
that recovered instances by diffusion models are in the bounded neighborhood of
the original instance with high probability; and the "one-shot" denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) can approximate the mean of the generated
distribution of a continuous-time diffusion model, which approximates the
original instance under mild conditions. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a
certifiably robust pipeline DiffSmooth, which first performs adversarial
purification via diffusion models and then maps the purified instances to a
common region via a simple yet effective local smoothing strategy. We conduct
extensive experiments on different datasets and show that DiffSmooth achieves
SOTA-certified robustness compared with eight baselines. For instance,
DiffSmooth improves the SOTA-certified accuracy from $36.0\%$ to $53.0\%$ under
$\ell_2$ radius $1.5$ on ImageNet. The code is available at
[https://github.com/javyduck/DiffSmooth].

<p class="mathjax">Real-world vision tasks frequently suffer from the appearance of adverse
weather conditions including rain, fog, snow, and raindrops in captured images.
Recently, several generic methods for restoring weather-degraded images have
been proposed, aiming to remove multiple types of adverse weather effects
present in the images. However, these methods have considered weather as
discrete and mutually exclusive variables, leading to failure in generalizing
to unforeseen weather conditions beyond the scope of the training data, such as
the co-occurrence of rain, fog, and raindrops. To this end, weather-degraded
image restoration models should have flexible adaptability to the current
unknown weather condition to ensure reliable and optimal performance. The
adaptation method should also be able to cope with data scarcity for real-world
adaptation. This paper proposes MetaWeather, a few-shot weather-degraded image
restoration method for arbitrary weather conditions. For this, we devise the
core piece of MetaWeather, coined Degradation Pattern Matching Module (DPMM),
which leverages representations from a few-shot support set by matching
features between input and sample images under new weather conditions. In
addition, we build meta-knowledge with episodic meta-learning on top of our
MetaWeather architecture to provide flexible adaptability. In the meta-testing
phase, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method to preserve the
prebuilt knowledge and avoid the overfitting problem. Experiments on the BID
Task II.A dataset show our method achieves the best performance on PSNR and
SSIM compared to state-of-the-art image restoration methods. Code is available
at (TBA).

<p class="mathjax">Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been recognized as a key
component in the envisioned 6G communication systems. Understanding the
fundamental performance tradeoff between sensing and communication
functionalities is essential for designing practical cost-efficient ISAC
systems. In this paper, we aim for augmenting the current understanding of the
deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) between sensing and communication, by
analyzing the sensing-optimal operating point of the fundamental
capacity-distortion region. We show that the DRT exists for generic sensing
performance metrics that are in general not convex/concave in the ISAC
waveform. Especially, we elaborate on a representative non-convex performance
metric, namely the detection probability for target detection tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have received enormous attention
over the past year and are now used by hundreds of millions of people every
day. The rapid adoption of this technology naturally raises questions about the
possible biases such models might exhibit. In this work, we tested one of these
models (GPT-3) on a range of cognitive effects, which are systematic patterns
that are usually found in human cognitive tasks. We found that LLMs are indeed
prone to several human cognitive effects. Specifically, we show that the
priming, distance, SNARC, and size congruity effects were presented with GPT-3,
while the anchoring effect is absent. We describe our methodology, and
specifically the way we converted real-world experiments to text-based
experiments. Finally, we speculate on the possible reasons why GPT-3 exhibits
these effects and discuss whether they are imitated or reinvented.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing machine learning
(ML) models that can promote fairness, i.e., eliminating biased predictions
towards certain populations (e.g., individuals from a specific demographic
group). Most existing works learn such models based on well-designed fairness
constraints in optimization. Nevertheless, in many practical ML tasks, only
very few labeled data samples can be collected, which can lead to inferior
fairness performance. This is because existing fairness constraints are
designed to restrict the prediction disparity among different sensitive groups,
but with few samples, it becomes difficult to accurately measure the disparity,
thus rendering ineffective fairness optimization. In this paper, we define the
fairness-aware learning task with limited training samples as the \emph{fair
few-shot learning} problem. To deal with this problem, we devise a novel
framework that accumulates fairness-aware knowledge across different
meta-training tasks and then generalizes the learned knowledge to meta-test
tasks. To compensate for insufficient training samples, we propose an essential
strategy to select and leverage an auxiliary set for each meta-test task. These
auxiliary sets contain several labeled training samples that can enhance the
model performance regarding fairness in meta-test tasks, thereby allowing for
the transfer of learned useful fairness-oriented knowledge to meta-test tasks.
Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to
validate the superiority of our framework against the state-of-the-art
baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Much work in the March Madness literature has discussed how to estimate the
probability that any one team beats any other team. There has been strikingly
little work, however, on what to do with these win probabilities. Hence we pose
the multi-brackets problem: given these probabilities, what is the best way to
submit a set of $n$ brackets to a March Madness bracket challenge? This is an
extremely difficult question, so we begin with a simpler situation. In
particular, we compare various sets of $n$ randomly sampled brackets, subject
to different entropy ranges or levels of chalkiness (rougly, chalkier brackets
feature fewer upsets). We learn three lessons. First, the observed NCAA
tournament is a "typical" bracket with a certain "right" amount of entropy
(roughly, a "right" amount of upsets), not a chalky bracket. Second, to
maximize the expected score of a set of $n$ randomly sampled brackets, we
should be successively less chalky as the number of submitted brackets
increases. Third, to maximize the probability of winning a bracket challenge
against a field of opposing brackets, we should tailor the chalkiness of our
brackets to the chalkiness of our opponents' brackets.

<p class="mathjax">This work considers the problem of heterogeneous graph-level anomaly
detection. Heterogeneous graphs are commonly used to represent behaviours
between different types of entities in complex industrial systems for capturing
as much information about the system operations as possible. Detecting
anomalous heterogeneous graphs from a large set of system behaviour graphs is
crucial for many real-world applications like online web/mobile service and
cloud access control. To address the problem, we propose HRGCN, an unsupervised
deep heterogeneous graph neural network, to model complex heterogeneous
relations between different entities in the system for effectively identifying
these anomalous behaviour graphs. HRGCN trains a hierarchical
relation-augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HetGNN), which learns
better graph representations by modelling the interactions among all the system
entities and considering both source-to-destination entity (node) types and
their relation (edge) types. Extensive evaluation on two real-world application
datasets shows that HRGCN outperforms state-of-the-art competing anomaly
detection approaches. We further present a real-world industrial case study to
justify the effectiveness of HRGCN in detecting anomalous (e.g., congested)
network devices in a mobile communication service. HRGCN is available at
https://github.com/jiaxililearn/HRGCN.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets, we employ three strategies: utilizing
medical knowledge-graphs, reconstructing real-world dialogues, and
incorporating human-guided preference rephrasing. These datasets are
instrumental in training DISC-MedLLM, surpassing existing medical LLMs in both
single-turn and multi-turn consultation scenarios. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in bridging the gap
between general language models and real-world medical consultation.
Additionally, we release the constructed dataset and model weights to further
contribute to research and development. Further details and resources can be

<p class="mathjax">In Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), the inherent openness and
extensive broadcast coverage expose these networks to significant eavesdropping
threats. Considering the inherent co-channel interference due to spectrum
sharing among multi-tier access networks in SAGIN, it can be leveraged to
assist the physical layer security among heterogeneous transmissions. However,
it is challenging to conduct a secrecy-oriented access strategy due to both
heterogeneous resources and different eavesdropping models. In this paper, we
explore secure access selection for a scenario involving multi-mode users
capable of accessing satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, or base stations in
the presence of eavesdroppers. Particularly, we propose a Q-network
approximation based deep learning approach for selecting the optimal access
strategy for maximizing the sum secrecy rate. Meanwhile, the power optimization
is also carried out by an unsupervised learning approach to improve the secrecy
performance. Remarkably, two neural networks are trained by unsupervised
learning and Q-network approximation which are both label-free methods without
knowing the optimal solution as labels. Numerical results verify the efficiency
of our proposed power optimization approach and access strategy, leading to
enhanced secure transmission performance.

<p class="mathjax">The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a classical problem that models
sequential decision-making under uncertainty in reinforcement learning. In this
study, we propose a new generalized upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm
(GWA-UCB1) by extending UCB1, which is a representative algorithm for MAB
problems, using generalized weighted averages, and present an effective
algorithm for various problem settings. GWA-UCB1 is a two-parameter
generalization of the balance between exploration and exploitation in UCB1 and
can be implemented with a simple modification of the UCB1 formula. Therefore,
this algorithm can be easily applied to UCB-based reinforcement learning
models. In preliminary experiments, we investigated the optimal parameters of a
simple generalized UCB1 (G-UCB1), prepared for comparison and GWA-UCB1, in a
stochastic MAB problem with two arms. Subsequently, we confirmed the
performance of the algorithms with the investigated parameters on stochastic
MAB problems when arm reward probabilities were sampled from uniform or normal
distributions and on survival MAB problems assuming more realistic situations.
GWA-UCB1 outperformed G-UCB1, UCB1-Tuned, and Thompson sampling in most problem
settings and can be useful in many situations. The code is available at
https://github.com/manome/python-mab.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPTs and LLaMa have ushered in a
revolution in machine intelligence, owing to their exceptional capabilities in
a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, the transition of LLMs from
data centers to edge devices presents a set of challenges and opportunities.
While this shift can enhance privacy and availability, it is hampered by the
enormous parameter sizes of these models, leading to impractical runtime costs.
In light of these considerations, we introduce EdgeMoE, the first on-device
inference engine tailored for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs, a popular variant
of sparse LLMs that exhibit nearly constant computational complexity as their
parameter size scales. EdgeMoE achieves both memory and computational
efficiency by strategically partitioning the model across the storage
hierarchy. Specifically, non-expert weights are stored in the device's memory,
while expert weights are kept in external storage and are fetched into memory
only when they are activated. This design is underpinned by a crucial insight
that expert weights, though voluminous, are infrequently accessed due to sparse
activation patterns. To further mitigate the overhead associated with expert
I/O swapping, EdgeMoE incorporates two innovative techniques: (1) Expert-wise
bitwidth adaptation: This method reduces the size of expert weights with an
acceptable level of accuracy loss. (2) Expert management: It predicts the
experts that will be activated in advance and preloads them into the
compute-I/O pipeline, thus further optimizing the process. In empirical
evaluations conducted on well-established MoE LLMs and various edge devices,
EdgeMoE demonstrates substantial memory savings and performance improvements
when compared to competitive baseline solutions.

<p class="mathjax">The unprecedented performance of large language models (LLMs) requires
comprehensive and accurate evaluation. We argue that for LLMs evaluation,
benchmarks need to be comprehensive and systematic. To this end, we propose the
ZhuJiu benchmark, which has the following strengths: (1) Multi-dimensional
ability coverage: We comprehensively evaluate LLMs across 7 ability dimensions
covering 51 tasks. Especially, we also propose a new benchmark that focuses on
knowledge ability of LLMs. (2) Multi-faceted evaluation methods collaboration:
We use 3 different yet complementary evaluation methods to comprehensively
evaluate LLMs, which can ensure the authority and accuracy of the evaluation
results. (3) Comprehensive Chinese benchmark: ZhuJiu is the pioneering
benchmark that fully assesses LLMs in Chinese, while also providing equally
robust evaluation abilities in English. (4) Avoiding potential data leakage: To
avoid data leakage, we construct evaluation data specifically for 37 tasks. We
evaluate 10 current mainstream LLMs and conduct an in-depth discussion and
analysis of their results. The ZhuJiu benchmark and open-participation
leaderboard are publicly released at <a href="http://www.zhujiu-benchmark.com/">this http URL</a> and we

<p class="mathjax">Although Transformer has achieved great success in natural language process
and computer vision, it has difficulty generalizing to medium and large-scale
graph data for two important reasons: (i) High complexity. (ii) Failing to
capture the complex and entangled structure information. In graph
representation learning, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) can fuse the graph
structure and node attributes but have limited receptive fields. Therefore, we
question whether can we combine Transformers and GNNs to help each other. In
this paper, we propose a new model named TransGNN where the Transformer layer
and GNN layer are used alternately to improve each other. Specifically, to
expand the receptive field and disentangle the information aggregation from
edges, we propose using Transformer to aggregate more relevant nodes'
information to improve the message passing of GNNs. Besides, to capture the
graph structure information, we utilize positional encoding and make use of the
GNN layer to fuse the structure into node attributes, which improves the
Transformer in graph data. We also propose to sample the most relevant nodes
for Transformer and two efficient samples update strategies to lower the
complexity. At last, we theoretically prove that TransGNN is more expressive
than GNNs only with extra linear complexity. The experiments on eight datasets
corroborate the effectiveness of TransGNN on node and graph classification
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we develop a geometric framework for generating non-slip
quadrupedal two-beat gaits. We consider a four-bar mechanism as a surrogate
model for a contact state and develop the geometric tools such as shape-change
basis to aid in gait generation, local connection as the matrix-equation of
motion, and stratified panels to model net locomotion in line with previous
work\cite{prasad2023contactswitch}. Standard two-beat gaits in quadrupedal
systems like trot divide the shape space into two equal, decoupled subspaces.
The subgaits generated in each subspace space are designed independently and
when combined with appropriate phasing generate a two-beat gait where the
displacements add up due to the geometric nature of the system. By adding
``scaling" and ``sliding" control knobs to subgaits defined as flows over the
shape-change basis, we continuously steer an arbitrary, planar quadrupedal
system. This exhibits translational anisotropy when modulated using the scaling
inputs. To characterize the steering induced by sliding inputs, we define an
average path curvature function analytically and show that the steering gaits
can be generated using a geometric nonslip contact modeling framework.

mainstream. We view speech emotion understanding as a perception task which is
a more realistic setting. With varying contexts (languages, demographics, etc.)
different share of people perceive the same speech segment as a non-unanimous
emotion. As part of the ACM Multimedia 2023 Computational Paralinguistics
ChallengE (ComParE) in the EMotion Share track, we leverage their rich dataset
of multilingual speakers and multi-label regression target of 'emotion share'
or perception of that emotion. We demonstrate that the training scheme of
different foundation models dictates their effectiveness for tasks beyond
speech recognition, especially for non-semantic speech tasks like emotion
<br />understanding. This is a very complex task due to multilingual speakers,
variability in the target labels, and inherent imbalance in the regression

<p class="mathjax">Music editing primarily entails the modification of instrument tracks or
remixing in the whole, which offers a novel reinterpretation of the original
piece through a series of operations. These music processing methods hold
immense potential across various applications but demand substantial expertise.
Prior methodologies, although effective for image and audio modifications,
falter when directly applied to music. This is attributed to music's
distinctive data nature, where such methods can inadvertently compromise the
intrinsic harmony and coherence of music. In this paper, we develop InstructME,
an Instruction guided Music Editing and remixing framework based on latent
diffusion models. Our framework fortifies the U-Net with multi-scale
aggregation in order to maintain consistency before and after editing. In
addition, we introduce chord progression matrix as condition information and
incorporate it in the semantic space to improve melodic harmony while editing.
For accommodating extended musical pieces, InstructME employs a chunk
transformer, enabling it to discern long-term temporal dependencies within
music sequences. We tested InstructME in instrument-editing, remixing, and
multi-round editing. Both subjective and objective evaluations indicate that
our proposed method significantly surpasses preceding systems in music quality,
text relevance and harmony. Demo samples are available at

<p class="mathjax">In today's landscape, smartphones have evolved into hubs for hosting a
multitude of deep learning models aimed at local execution. A key realization
driving this work is the notable fragmentation among these models,
characterized by varied architectures, operators, and implementations. This
fragmentation imposes a significant burden on the comprehensive optimization of
hardware, system settings, and algorithms.
<br />Buoyed by the recent strides in large foundation models, this work introduces
a pioneering paradigm for mobile AI: a collaborative management approach
between the mobile OS and hardware, overseeing a foundational model capable of
serving a broad spectrum of mobile AI tasks, if not all. This foundational
model resides within the NPU and remains impervious to app or OS revisions,
akin to firmware. Concurrently, each app contributes a concise, offline
fine-tuned "adapter" tailored to distinct downstream tasks. From this concept
emerges a concrete instantiation known as \sys. It amalgamates a curated
selection of publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) and facilitates
dynamic data flow. This concept's viability is substantiated through the
creation of an exhaustive benchmark encompassing 38 mobile AI tasks spanning 50
datasets, including domains such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language
Processing (NLP), audio, sensing, and multimodal inputs. Spanning this
benchmark, \sys unveils its impressive performance. It attains accuracy parity
in 85\% of tasks, demonstrates improved scalability in terms of storage and
memory, and offers satisfactory inference speed on Commercial Off-The-Shelf
(COTS) mobile devices fortified with NPU support. This stands in stark contrast
to task-specific models tailored for individual applications.

<p class="mathjax">An important challenge in Machine Learning compilers like XLA is multi-pass
optimization and analysis. There has been recent interest chiefly in XLA
target-dependent optimization on the graph-level, subgraph-level, and
kernel-level phases. We specifically focus on target-independent optimization
XLA HLO pass ordering: our approach aims at finding the optimal sequence of
compiler optimization passes, which is decoupled from target-dependent
optimization. However, there is little domain specific study in pass ordering
for XLA HLO. To this end, we propose introducing deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL) based search for optimal XLA HLO pass ordering. We also propose
enhancements to the deep RL algorithms to further improve optimal search
performance and open the research direction for domain-specific guidance for
RL. We create an XLA Gym experimentation framework as a tool to enable RL
algorithms to interact with the compiler for passing optimizations and thereby
train agents. Overall, in our experimentation we observe an average of $13.3\%$
improvement in operation count reduction on a benchmark of GPT-2 training
graphs and $10.4\%$ improvement on a diverse benchmark including GPT-2, BERT,
and ResNet graphs using the proposed approach over the compiler's default phase
ordering.

<p class="mathjax">The Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming an integral part of modern
communication networks due to their superior proficiency in language
comprehension and generation. In the context of these networks, where limited
data and computing resources often necessitate the use of third-party data and
computing resources, the risk of backdoor attacks becomes highly significant.
Such strategies may expose the model within the network to maliciously
manipulated training data and processing, providing an opportunity for
attackers to embed a hidden backdoor into the model, termed a backdoor attack.
Backdoor attack in LLMs refers to embedding a hidden backdoor in LLMs that
causes the model to perform normally on benign samples but exhibit degraded
performance on poisoned ones. This issue is particularly concerning within
communication networks where reliability and security are paramount. Despite
the extensive research on backdoor attacks, there remains a lack of in-depth
exploration specifically within the context of LLMs employed in communication
networks, and a systematic review of such attacks is currently absent. In this
survey, we systematically propose a taxonomy of backdoor attacks in LLMs as
used in communication networks, dividing them into four major categories:
input-triggered, prompt-triggered, instruction-triggered, and
demonstration-triggered attacks. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of the benchmark datasets within the network domain. Finally, we
identify potential problems and open challenges, offering valuable insights
into future research directions for enhancing the security and integrity of
LLMs in communication networks.

<p class="mathjax">Modern communication systems rely on accurate channel estimation to achieve
efficient and reliable transmission of information. As the communication
channel response is highly related to the user's location, one can use a neural
network to map the user's spatial coordinates to the channel coefficients.
However, these latter are rapidly varying as a function of the location, on the
order of the wavelength. Classical neural architectures being biased towards
learning low frequency functions (spectral bias), such mapping is therefore
notably difficult to learn. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper
presents a frugal, model-based network that separates the low frequency from
the high frequency components of the target mapping function. This yields an
hypernetwork architecture where the neural network only learns low frequency
sparse coefficients in a dictionary of high frequency components. Simulation
results show that the proposed neural network outperforms standard approaches
on realistic synthetic data.

<p class="mathjax">Learning-based surface reconstruction based on unsigned distance functions
(UDF) has many advantages such as handling open surfaces. We propose SuperUDF,
a self-supervised UDF learning which exploits a learned geometry prior for
efficient training and a novel regularization for robustness to sparse
sampling. The core idea of SuperUDF draws inspiration from the classical
surface approximation operator of locally optimal projection (LOP). The key
insight is that if the UDF is estimated correctly, the 3D points should be
locally projected onto the underlying surface following the gradient of the
UDF. Based on that, a number of inductive biases on UDF geometry and a
pre-learned geometry prior are devised to learn UDF estimation efficiently. A
novel regularization loss is proposed to make SuperUDF robust to sparse
sampling. Furthermore, we also contribute a learning-based mesh extraction from
the estimated UDFs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SuperUDF outperforms
the state of the arts on several public datasets in terms of both quality and
efficiency. Code will be released after accteptance.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to new tasks and environments
without forgetting previously learned knowledge. While current CL setups have
ignored the relationship between labels in the past task and the new task with
or without small task overlaps, real-world scenarios often involve hierarchical
relationships between old and new tasks, posing another challenge for
traditional CL approaches. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
multi-level hierarchical class incremental task configuration with an online
learning constraint, called hierarchical label expansion (HLE). Our
configuration allows a network to first learn coarse-grained classes, with data
labels continually expanding to more fine-grained classes in various hierarchy
depths. To tackle this new setup, we propose a rehearsal-based method that
utilizes hierarchy-aware pseudo-labeling to incorporate hierarchical class
information. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective memory management
and sampling strategy that selectively adopts samples of newly encountered
classes. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively
use hierarchy on our HLE setup to improve classification accuracy across all
levels of hierarchies, regardless of depth and class imbalance ratio,
outperforming prior state-of-the-art works by significant margins while also
outperforming them on the conventional disjoint, blurry and i-Blurry CL setups.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly popular in network intrusion
detection. However, ML-based solutions always respond regardless of whether the
input data reflects known patterns, a common issue across safety-critical
applications. While several proposals exist for detecting Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) in other fields, it remains unclear whether these approaches can
effectively identify new forms of intrusions for network security. New attacks,
not necessarily affecting overall distributions, are not guaranteed to be
clearly OOD as instead, images depicting new classes are in computer vision. In
this work, we investigate whether existing OOD detectors from other fields
allow the identification of unknown malicious traffic. We also explore whether
more discriminative and semantically richer embedding spaces within models,
such as those created with contrastive learning and multi-class tasks, benefit
detection. Our investigation covers a set of six OOD techniques that employ
different detection strategies. These techniques are applied to models trained
in various ways and subsequently exposed to unknown malicious traffic from the
same and different datasets (network environments). Our findings suggest that
existing detectors can identify a consistent portion of new malicious traffic,
and that improved embedding spaces enhance detection. We also demonstrate that
simple combinations of certain detectors can identify almost 100% of malicious
traffic in our tested scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic forecasting is a fundamental problem in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic predictors are limited by their expressive power to
model the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data, mainly due to
the following limitations. Firstly, most approaches are primarily designed to
model the local shared patterns, which makes them insufficient to capture the
specific patterns associated with each node globally. Hence, they fail to learn
each node's unique properties and diversified patterns. Secondly, most existing
approaches struggle to accurately model both short- and long-term dependencies
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic predictor, named Meta
Attentive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MAGCRN). MAGCRN utilizes a
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN) as a core module to model local
dependencies and improves its operation with two novel modules: 1) a
Node-Specific Meta Pattern Learning (NMPL) module to capture node-specific
patterns globally and 2) a Node Attention Weight Generation Module (NAWG)
module to capture short- and long-term dependencies by connecting the
node-specific features with the ones learned initially at each time step during
GCRN operation. Experiments on six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that
NMPL and NAWG together enable MAGCRN to outperform state-of-the-art baselines
on both short- and long-term predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Label Image Recognition (MLIR) is a challenging task that aims to
predict multiple object labels in a single image while modeling the complex
relationships between labels and image regions. Although convolutional neural
networks and vision transformers have succeeded in processing images as regular
grids of pixels or patches, these representations are sub-optimal for capturing
irregular and discontinuous regions of interest. In this work, we present the
first fully graph convolutional model, Group K-nearest neighbor based Graph
convolutional Network (GKGNet), which models the connections between semantic
label embeddings and image patches in a flexible and unified graph structure.
To address the scale variance of different objects and to capture information
from multiple perspectives, we propose the Group KGCN module for dynamic graph
construction and message passing. Our experiments demonstrate that GKGNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational
costs on the challenging multi-label datasets, \ie MS-COCO and VOC2007
datasets. We will release the code and models to facilitate future research in
this area.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a growing torrent that has recently
transformed machine learning and its many real world applications, by learning
on massive amounts of unlabeled data via self-generated supervisory signals.
Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) has also capitalized on SSL, by
self-generating pseudo-anomalies through various data augmentation functions or
external data exposure. In this vision paper, we first underline the importance
of the choice of SSL strategies on AD performance, by presenting evidences and
studies from the AD literature. Equipped with the understanding that SSL incurs
various hyperparameters (HPs) to carefully tune, we present recent developments
on unsupervised model selection and augmentation tuning for SSL-based AD. We
then highlight emerging challenges and future opportunities; on designing new
pretext tasks and augmentation functions for different data modalities,
creating novel model selection solutions for systematically tuning the SSL HPs,
as well as on capitalizing on the potential of pretrained foundation models on
AD through effective density estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Light-weight time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors are compact and
cost-efficient, and thus widely used on mobile devices for tasks such as
autofocus and obstacle detection. However, due to the sparse and noisy depth
measurements, these sensors have rarely been considered for dense geometry
reconstruction. In this work, we present the first dense SLAM system with a
monocular camera and a light-weight ToF sensor. Specifically, we propose a
multi-modal implicit scene representation that supports rendering both the
signals from the RGB camera and light-weight ToF sensor which drives the
optimization by comparing with the raw sensor inputs. Moreover, in order to
guarantee successful pose tracking and reconstruction, we exploit a predicted
depth as an intermediate supervision and develop a coarse-to-fine optimization
strategy for efficient learning of the implicit representation. At last, the
temporal information is explicitly exploited to deal with the noisy signals
from light-weight ToF sensors to improve the accuracy and robustness of the
system. Experiments demonstrate that our system well exploits the signals of
light-weight ToF sensors and achieves competitive results both on camera
tracking and dense scene reconstruction. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">Food computing has emerged as a prominent multidisciplinary field of research
in recent years. An ambitious goal of food computing is to develop end-to-end
intelligent systems capable of autonomously producing recipe information for a
food image. Current image-to-recipe methods are retrieval-based and their
success depends heavily on the dataset size and diversity, as well as the
quality of learned embeddings. Meanwhile, the emergence of powerful
attention-based vision and language models presents a promising avenue for
accurate and generalizable recipe generation, which has yet to be extensively
explored. This paper proposes FIRE, a novel multimodal methodology tailored to
recipe generation in the food computing domain, which generates the food title,
ingredients, and cooking instructions based on input food images. FIRE
leverages the BLIP model to generate titles, utilizes a Vision Transformer with
a decoder for ingredient extraction, and employs the T5 model to generate
recipes incorporating titles and ingredients as inputs. We showcase two
practical applications that can benefit from integrating FIRE with large
language model prompting: recipe customization to fit recipes to user
preferences and recipe-to-code transformation to enable automated cooking
processes. Our experimental findings validate the efficacy of our proposed
approach, underscoring its potential for future advancements and widespread
adoption in food computing.

<p class="mathjax">Video instance segmentation is a challenging task that serves as the
cornerstone of numerous downstream applications, including video editing and
autonomous driving. In this report, we present further improvements to the SOTA
VIS method, DVIS. First, we introduce a denoising training strategy for the
trainable tracker, allowing it to achieve more stable and accurate object
tracking in complex and long videos. Additionally, we explore the role of
visual foundation models in video instance segmentation. By utilizing a frozen
VIT-L model pre-trained by DINO v2, DVIS demonstrates remarkable performance
improvements. With these enhancements, our method achieves 57.9 AP and 56.0 AP
in the development and test phases, respectively, and ultimately ranked 1st in
the VIS track of the 5th LSVOS Challenge. The code will be available at
https://github.com/zhang-tao-whu/DVIS.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of underwater crawling and adjustment of the body posture for
underwater manipulating of the deep-sea crawling and swimming robot (DCSR) is
directly influenced by the dynamic performance of the underwater mechanical
legs (UWML), as it serves as the executive mechanism of the DCSR. Compared with
the mechanical legs of legged robots working on land, the UWML of the DCSR not
only possesses the characteristics of the land used mechanical legs, but is
also affected by the influence of the deep-sea underwater working environment
(i.e., the hydrodynamic force, viscous resistance and dynamic seal resistance).
To reduce these influence, firstly, the hydrodynamic force of the UWML were
researched based on theory and experiment, and the hydrodynamic model was
established with the fitted hydrodynamic parameters. Secondly, the oil viscous
resistance and the dynamic seal resistance were studied experimentally, and the
change laws of both with respect to the joint speed and the ambient pressure
(depth of operation) were obtained. The results provide a basis for the
subsequent research on the structure optimization and high performance control
of the UWML and DCSR.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has raised
concerns about the authenticity of multimedia content in various fields.
However, existing research for forgery content detection has focused mainly on
binary classification tasks of complete videos, which has limited applicability
in industrial settings. To address this gap, we propose UMMAFormer, a novel
universal transformer framework for temporal forgery localization (TFL) that
predicts forgery segments with multimodal adaptation. Our approach introduces a
Temporal Feature Abnormal Attention (TFAA) module based on temporal feature
reconstruction to enhance the detection of temporal differences. We also design
a Parallel Cross-Attention Feature Pyramid Network (PCA-FPN) to optimize the
Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for subtle feature enhancement. To evaluate the
proposed method, we contribute a novel Temporal Video Inpainting Localization
(TVIL) dataset specifically tailored for video inpainting scenes. Our
experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets, including Lav-DF, TVIL, and Psynd, significantly
outperforming previous methods. The code and data are available at
https://github.com/ymhzyj/UMMAFormer/.

utilizing a sophisticated collection of YOLOv8 models, meticulously adapted for
the DL Sprint 2.0 - BUET CSE Fest 2023 Competition that centers around Bangla
document layout segmentation. Our primary focus lies in elevating various
elements of the task, including techniques like image augmentation, model

quality of a subset of document images to enhance the resilience of model
training, consequently leading to an improvement in our cross-validation score.
Employing Bayesian optimization, we determine the optimal confidence and IoU

<p class="mathjax">In computer vision, depth estimation is crucial for domains like robotics,
autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and virtual reality. Integrating
semantics with depth enhances scene understanding through reciprocal
information sharing. However, the scarcity of semantic information in datasets
poses challenges. Existing convolutional approaches with limited local
receptive fields hinder the full utilization of the symbiotic potential between
depth and semantics. This paper introduces a dataset-invariant semi-supervised
strategy to address the scarcity of semantic information. It proposes the Depth
Semantics Symbiosis module, leveraging the Symbiotic Transformer for achieving
comprehensive mutual awareness by information exchange within both local and
global contexts. Additionally, a novel augmentation, NearFarMix is introduced
to combat overfitting and compensate both depth-semantic tasks by strategically
merging regions from two images, generating diverse and structurally consistent
samples with enhanced control. Extensive experiments on NYU-Depth-V2 and KITTI
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed techniques in indoor and
outdoor environments.

<p class="mathjax">Code datasets are of immense value for training neural-network-based code
completion models, where companies or organizations have made substantial
investments to establish and process these datasets. Unluckily, these datasets,
either built for proprietary or public usage, face the high risk of
unauthorized exploits, resulting from data leakages, license violations, etc.
Even worse, the ``black-box'' nature of neural models sets a high barrier for
externals to audit their training datasets, which further connives these
unauthorized usages. Currently, watermarking methods have been proposed to
prohibit inappropriate usage of image and natural language datasets. However,
due to domain specificity, they are not directly applicable to code datasets,
leaving the copyright protection of this emerging and important field of code
data still exposed to threats. To fill this gap, we propose a method, named
CodeMark, to embed user-defined imperceptible watermarks into code datasets to
trace their usage in training neural code completion models. CodeMark is based
on adaptive semantic-preserving transformations, which preserve the exact
functionality of the code data and keep the changes covert against
rule-breakers. We implement CodeMark in a toolkit and conduct an extensive
evaluation of code completion models. CodeMark is validated to fulfill all
desired properties of practical watermarks, including harmlessness to model
accuracy, verifiability, robustness, and imperceptibility.

<p class="mathjax">Learning and practicing table tennis with traditional methods is a long,
tedious process and may even lead to the internalization of incorrect
techniques if not supervised by a coach. To overcome these issues, the
presented study proposes an exergame with the aim of enhancing young female
novice players' performance by boosting muscle memory, making practice more
interesting, and decreasing the probability of faulty training. Specifically,
we propose an exergame based on skeleton tracking and a virtual avatar to
support correct shadow practice to learn forehand drive technique without the
presence of a coach. We recruited 44 schoolgirls aged between 8 and 12 years
without a background in playing table tennis and divided them into control and
experimental groups. We examined their stroke skills (via the Mott-Lockhart
test) and the error coefficient of their forehand drives (using a ball machine)
in the pretest, post-test, and follow-up tests (10 days after the post-test).
Our results showed that the experimental group had progress in the short and
long term, while the control group had an improvement only in the short term.
Further, the scale of improvement in the experimental group was significantly
higher than in the control group. Given that the early stages of learning,
particularly in girls children, are important in the internalization of
individual skills in would-be athletes, this method could support promoting
correct training for young females.

<p class="mathjax">Functionally graded materials (FGM) are applied in HVDC gas insulated lines
(GIL) to control the electric field within the DC insulation system. In HVDC
GIL, FGM with a spatial distribution of the electric conductivity
(conductivity-FGM) is applied to control the electric field under DC steady
state condition. However, besides DC steady state, different DC conditions
occur, e.g. DC-on process, polarity reversal and lightning impulse. Under these
conditions conductivity-FGM is not sufficient to control the electric field,
since these conditions result in transient capacitive fields, where the
permittivity is decisive for the electric field. In this paper, we suggest
combining conductivity-FGM and a spatial distribution of permittivity
(permittivity-FGM) in the spacer material to control the electric field around
DC-GIL spacer for various DC-conditions, considering nonlinear material models
for the insulating gas and the epoxy spacer. A variation of the spatial
distribution of permittivity and conductivity in the spacer is investigated in
this paper for an effective field reduction. The results show a reduction of
the electric field intensity up to 65.8 %, when conductivity/permittivity-FGM
is applied.

<p class="mathjax">Denoising diffusion models have emerged as the go-to framework for solving
inverse problems in imaging. A critical concern regarding these models is their
performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, which remains an under-explored
challenge. Realistic reconstructions inconsistent with the measured data can be
generated, hallucinating image features that are uniquely present in the
training dataset. To simultaneously enforce data-consistency and leverage
data-driven priors, we introduce a novel sampling framework called Steerable
Conditional Diffusion. This framework adapts the denoising network specifically
to the available measured data. Utilising our proposed method, we achieve
substantial enhancements in OOD performance across diverse imaging modalities,
advancing the robust deployment of denoising diffusion models in real-world
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: Community college counselors and students use articulation agreement
websites to (a) learn how community college courses will transfer and fulfill
university requirements and (b) develop an academic plan to prepare to
transfer. Compared to universities that do not have them, universities that do
have articulation agreements provide more transparency about course transfer.
However, the literature displays conflicting results on whether articulation
agreements improve transfer-related outcomes; perhaps one contributor to these
conflicting research results is the subpar user experience of articulation
agreement reports and the websites that host them. Approach: Accordingly, we
surveyed and interviewed California community college transfer students to
gather their suggestions for new academic-advising-related software features
for the ASSIST website. ASSIST is California's official centralized repository
of articulation agreement reports between public California community colleges
and universities. We analyzed the open-ended survey and interview data using
structural coding and thematic analysis. Findings: We identified four themes
around students' software feature suggestions for ASSIST: (a) features that
automate laborious academic advising tasks, (b) features to reduce ambiguity
with articulation agreements, (c) features to mitigate mistakes in term-by-term
course planning, and (d) features to facilitate online advising from counselors
and student peers. Originality: Our research builds on the scant literature on
incorporating education technology into articulation agreements. Furthermore,
some of the suggested academic-advising-related software features (and their
underlying pain points) are novel and have not been discussed before in prior
research.

<p class="mathjax">Data privacy and security have become a non-negligible factor in load
forecasting. Previous researches mainly focus on training stage enhancement.
However, once the model is trained and deployed, it may need to `forget' (i.e.,
remove the impact of) part of training data if the data is found to be
malicious or as requested by the data owner. This paper introduces machine
unlearning algorithm which is specifically designed to remove the influence of
part of the original dataset on an already trained forecaster. However, direct
unlearning inevitably degrades the model generalization ability. To balance
between unlearning completeness and performance degradation, a
performance-aware algorithm is proposed by evaluating the sensitivity of local
model parameter change using influence function and sample re-weighting.
Moreover, we observe that the statistic criterion cannot fully reflect the
operation cost of down-stream tasks. Therefore, a task-aware machine unlearning
is proposed whose objective is a tri-level optimization with dispatch and
redispatch problems considered. We theoretically prove the existence of the
gradient of such objective, which is key to re-weighting the remaining samples.
We test the unlearning algorithms on linear and neural network load forecasters
with realistic load dataset. The simulation demonstrates the balance on
unlearning completeness and operational cost. All codes can be found at
https://github.com/xuwkk/task_aware_machine_unlearning.

<p class="mathjax">Sensor fusion has become a popular topic in robotics. However, conventional
fusion methods encounter many difficulties, such as data representation
differences, sensor variations, and extrinsic calibration. For example, the
calibration methods used for LiDAR-camera fusion often require manual operation
and auxiliary calibration targets. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have
been developed for 3D scenes, and the volume density distribution involved in
an INR unifies the scene information obtained by different types of sensors.
Therefore, we propose implicit neural fusion (INF) for LiDAR and camera. INF
first trains a neural density field of the target scene using LiDAR frames.
Then, a separate neural color field is trained using camera images and the
trained neural density field. Along with the training process, INF both
estimates LiDAR poses and optimizes extrinsic parameters. Our experiments
demonstrate the high accuracy and stable performance of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">We present an analysis of the representation of gender as a data dimension in
data visualizations and propose a set of considerations around visual variables
and annotations for gender-related data. Gender is a common demographic
dimension of data collected from study or survey participants, passengers, or
customers, as well as across academic studies, especially in certain
disciplines like sociology. Our work contributes to multiple ongoing
discussions on the ethical implications of data visualizations. By choosing
specific data, visual variables, and text labels, visualization designers may,
inadvertently or not, perpetuate stereotypes and biases. Here, our goal is to
start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data
visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual
variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this
discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions
from five different scientific communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies,
Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from
Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase. Overall we
found that representation types are community-specific, color hue is the
dominant visual channel for gender data, and nonconforming gender is
under-represented. We end our paper with a discussion of considerations for
gender visualization derived from our coding and the literature and
recommendations for large data collection bodies. A free copy of this paper and

<p class="mathjax">Location information is often used as a proxy to guarantee the performance of
a wireless communication link. However, localization errors can result in a
significant mismatch with the guarantees, particularly detrimental to users
operating the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) regime. This
paper unveils the fundamental statistical relations between location estimation
uncertainty and wireless link reliability, specifically in the context of rate
selection for ultra-reliable communication. We start with a simple
one-dimensional narrowband Rayleigh fading scenario and build towards a
two-dimensional scenario in a rich scattering environment. The wireless link
reliability is characterized by the meta-probability, the probability with
respect to localization error of exceeding the outage capacity, and by removing
other sources of errors in the system, we show that reliability is sensitive to
localization errors. The $\epsilon$-outage coherence radius is defined and
shown to provide valuable insight into the problem of location-based rate
selection. However, it is generally challenging to guarantee reliability
without accurate knowledge of the propagation environment. Finally, several
rate-selection schemes are proposed, showcasing the problem's dynamics and
revealing that properly accounting for the localization error is critical to
ensure good performance in terms of reliability and achievable throughput.

<p class="mathjax">During the past decade, deep neural networks have led to fast-paced progress
and significant achievements in computer vision problems, for both academia and
industry. Yet despite their success, state-of-the-art image classification
approaches fail to generalize well in previously unseen visual contexts, as
required by many real-world applications. In this paper, we focus on this
domain generalization (DG) problem and argue that the generalization ability of
deep convolutional neural networks can be improved by taking advantage of
multi-layer and multi-scaled representations of the network. We introduce a
framework that aims at improving domain generalization of image classifiers by
combining both low-level and high-level features at multiple scales, enabling
the network to implicitly disentangle representations in its latent space and
learn domain-invariant attributes of the depicted objects. Additionally, to
further facilitate robust representation learning, we propose a novel objective
function, inspired by contrastive learning, which aims at constraining the
extracted representations to remain invariant under distribution shifts. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by evaluating on the domain
generalization datasets of PACS, VLCS, Office-Home and NICO. Through extensive
experimentation, we show that our model is able to surpass the performance of
previous DG methods and consistently produce competitive and state-of-the-art
results in all datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Different from traditional video cameras, event cameras capture asynchronous
events stream in which each event encodes pixel location, trigger time, and the
polarity of the brightness changes. In this paper, we introduce a novel
graph-based framework for event cameras, namely SlideGCN. Unlike some recent
graph-based methods that use groups of events as input, our approach can
efficiently process data event-by-event, unlock the low latency nature of
events data while still maintaining the graph's structure internally. For fast
graph construction, we develop a radius search algorithm, which better exploits
the partial regular structure of event cloud against k-d tree based generic
methods. Experiments show that our method reduces the computational complexity
up to 100 times with respect to current graph-based methods while keeping
state-of-the-art performance on object recognition. Moreover, we verify the
superiority of event-wise processing with our method. When the state becomes
stable, we can give a prediction with high confidence, thus making an early
recognition. Project page: \url{https://zju3dv.github.io/slide_gcn/}.

<p class="mathjax">Ethics, or moral philosophy, have existed throughout civil human history.
Ethics can be described simplistically as the study of what is good and bad or
good and evil. More relevant for contemporary societal discourses, are
behavioural understandings of ethics, and ethical practice. It is integral for
individuals operating in the fields of communications, design and technological
development to grasp what ethics are, how they relate and apply to specific
domains, where basic principles or similarities lie from context to context,
and where there may be differences. This article serves as an introduction to
ethics in the field of digital communication. It gives a brief overview of
applied ethics as a practical sub-field of ethics and observes ethics in
contemporary professional practice from practical, research, and theoretical
perspectives.The article also discusses the ways in which the nature of ethics
in the field of communication has been changing, and the impact of emerging
technology on these changes.

<p class="mathjax">Coalitions are central to politics, including government formation,
international relations, and public policy. Coalitions emerge when actors
engage one another across multiple relational contexts, but existing literature
often approaches coalitions in singular contexts. We introduce complex
coalitions, a theoretical-methodological framework that emphasises the
relevance of multiple contexts and cross-context dependencies in coalition
politics. We also implement tools to statistically infer such coalition
structures using multilayer networks. To demonstrate the usefulness of our
approach, we compare coalitions among Finnish organisations engaging in climate
politics across three con-texts: resource coordination, legacy media discourse,
and social media communication. We show that considering coalitions as complex
and accounting for cross-context dependencies improves the empirical validity
of coalition studies. In our case study, the three contexts represent
complementary, but not congruent, channels for enacting coalitions. In
conclusion, we argue that the complex coalitions approach is useful for
advancing understanding of coalitions in different political realms.

<p class="mathjax">Document-level relation extraction aims to identify relationships between
entities within a document. Current methods rely on text-based encoders and
employ various hand-coded pooling heuristics to aggregate information from
entity mentions and associated contexts. In this paper, we replace these rigid
pooling functions with explicit graph relations by leveraging the intrinsic
graph processing capabilities of the Transformer model. We propose a joint
text-graph Transformer model, and a graph-assisted declarative pooling (GADePo)
specification of the input which provides explicit and high-level instructions
for information aggregation. This allows the pooling process to be guided by
domain-specific knowledge or desired outcomes but still learned by the
Transformer, leading to more flexible and customizable pooling strategies. We
extensively evaluate our method across diverse datasets and models, and show
that our approach yields promising results that are comparable to those
achieved by the hand-coded pooling functions.

<p class="mathjax">Safe and optimal controller synthesis for switched-controlled hybrid systems,
which combine differential equations and discrete changes of the system's
state, is known to be intricately hard. Reinforcement learning has been
leveraged to construct near-optimal controllers, but their behavior is not
guaranteed to be safe, even when it is encouraged by reward engineering. One
way of imposing safety to a learned controller is to use a shield, which is
correct by design. However, obtaining a shield for non-linear and hybrid
environments is itself intractable. In this paper, we propose the construction
of a shield using the so-called barbaric method, where an approximate finite
representation of an underlying partition-based two-player safety game is
extracted via systematically picked samples of the true transition function.
While hard safety guarantees are out of reach, we experimentally demonstrate
strong statistical safety guarantees with a prototype implementation and UPPAAL
STRATEGO. Furthermore, we study the impact of the synthesized shield when
applied as either a pre-shield (applied before learning a controller) or a
post-shield (only applied after learning a controller). We experimentally
demonstrate superiority of the pre-shielding approach. We apply our technique
on a range of case studies, including two industrial examples, and further
study post-optimization of the post-shielding approach.

<p class="mathjax">Linking biomedical entities is an essential aspect in biomedical natural
language processing tasks, such as text mining and question answering. However,
a difficulty of linking the biomedical entities using current large language
models (LLM) trained on a general corpus is that biomedical entities are
scarcely distributed in texts and therefore have been rarely seen during
training by the LLM. At the same time, those LLMs are not aware of high level
semantic connection between different biomedical entities, which are useful in
identifying similar concepts in different textual contexts. To cope with
aforementioned problems, some recent works focused on injecting knowledge graph
information into LLMs. However, former methods either ignore the relational
knowledge of the entities or lead to catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, we
propose a novel framework to pre-train the powerful generative LLM by a corpus
synthesized from a KG. In the evaluations we are unable to confirm the benefit
of including synonym, description or relational information.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, artificial intelligence has had a conspicuous growth in
almost every aspect of life. One of the most applicable areas is security code
review, in which a lot of AI-based tools and approaches have been proposed.
Recently, ChatGPT has caught a huge amount of attention with its remarkable
performance in following instructions and providing a detailed response.
Regarding the similarities between natural language and code, in this paper, we
study the feasibility of using ChatGPT for vulnerability detection in Python
source code. Toward this goal, we feed an appropriate prompt along with
vulnerable data to ChatGPT and compare its results on two datasets with the
results of three widely used Static Application Security Testing tools (Bandit,
Semgrep and SonarQube). We implement different kinds of experiments with
ChatGPT and the results indicate that ChatGPT reduces the false positive and
false negative rates and has the potential to be used for Python source code
vulnerability detection.

<p class="mathjax">The index of success of the researchers are now mostly measured using the
Hirsch index ($h$). Our recent precise demonstration, that statistically $h
\sim \sqrt {N_c} \sim \sqrt {N_p}$, where $N_p$ and $N_c$ denote respectively
the total number of publications and total citations for the researcher,
suggests that average number of citations per paper ($N_c/N_p$), and hence $h$,
are statistical numbers (Dunbar numbers) depending on the community or network
to which the researcher belongs. We show here, extending our earlier
observations, that the indications of success are not reflected by the total
citations $N_c$, rather by the inequalities among citations from publications
to publications. Specifically, we show that for very successful authors, the
yearly variations in the Gini index ($g$, giving the average inequality of
citations for the publications) and the Kolkata index ($k$, giving the fraction
of total citations received by the top $1 - k$ fraction of publications; $k =
0.80$ corresponds to Pareto's 80/20 law) approach each other to $g = k \simeq
0.82$, signaling a precursor for the arrival of (or departure from) the
Self-Organized Critical (SOC) state of his/her publication statistics.
Analyzing the citation statistics (from Google Scholar) of thirty successful
scientists throughout their recorded publication history, we find that the $g$
and $k$ for very successful among them (mostly Nobel Laureates, highest rank
Stanford Cite-Scorers, and a few others) reach and hover just above (and then)
below that $g = k \simeq 0.82$ mark, while for others they remain below that
mark. We also find that for all the lower (than the SOC mark 0.82) values of
$k$ and $g$ fit a linear relationship $k = 1/2 + cg$, with $c = 0.39$.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language
questions with factual information such as entities and relations in KBs.
However, traditional Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are directly
pre-trained on large-scale natural language corpus, which poses challenges for
them in understanding and representing complex subgraphs in structured KBs. To
bridge the gap between texts and structured KBs, we propose a Structured
Knowledge-aware Pre-training method (SKP). In the pre-training stage, we
introduce two novel structured knowledge-aware tasks, guiding the model to
effectively learn the implicit relationship and better representations of
complex subgraphs. In downstream KBQA task, we further design an efficient
linearization strategy and an interval attention mechanism, which assist the
model to better encode complex subgraphs and shield the interference of
irrelevant subgraphs during reasoning respectively. Detailed experiments and
analyses on WebQSP verify the effectiveness of SKP, especially the significant
improvement in subgraph retrieval (+4.08% H@10).

<p class="mathjax">Score-based generative models (SGMs) have gained prominence in sparse-view CT
reconstruction for their precise sampling of complex distributions. In
SGM-based reconstruction, data consistency in the score-based diffusion model
ensures close adherence of generated samples to observed data distribution,
crucial for improving image quality. Shortcomings in data consistency
characterization manifest in three aspects. Firstly, data from the optimization
process can lead to artifacts in reconstructed images. Secondly, it often
neglects that the generation model and original data constraints are
independently completed, fragmenting unity. Thirdly, it predominantly focuses
on constraining intermediate results in the inverse sampling process, rather
than ideal real images. Thus, we propose an iterative optimization data scoring
model. This paper introduces the data-iterative optimization score-based model
(DOSM), integrating innovative data consistency into the Stochastic
Differential Equation, a valuable constraint for ultra-sparse-view CT
reconstruction. The novelty of this data consistency element lies in its sole
reliance on original measurement data to confine generation outcomes,
effectively balancing measurement data and generative model constraints.
Additionally, we pioneer an inference strategy that traces back from current
iteration results to ideal truth, enhancing reconstruction stability. We
leverage conventional iteration techniques to optimize DOSM updates.
Quantitative and qualitative results from 23 views of numerical and clinical
cardiac datasets demonstrate DOSM's superiority over other methods. Remarkably,
even with 10 views, our method achieves excellent performance.

<p class="mathjax">The objective of stylized speech-driven facial animation is to create
animations that encapsulate specific emotional expressions. Existing methods
often depend on pre-established emotional labels or facial expression
templates, which may limit the necessary flexibility for accurately conveying
user intent. In this research, we introduce a technique that enables the
control of arbitrary styles by leveraging natural language as emotion prompts.
This technique presents benefits in terms of both flexibility and
user-friendliness. To realize this objective, we initially construct a
Text-Expression Alignment Dataset (TEAD), wherein each facial expression is
paired with several prompt-like descriptions.We propose an innovative automatic
annotation method, supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), to expedite the
dataset construction, thereby eliminating the substantial expense of manual
annotation. Following this, we utilize TEAD to train a CLIP-based model, termed
ExpCLIP, which encodes text and facial expressions into semantically aligned
style embeddings. The embeddings are subsequently integrated into the facial
animation generator to yield expressive and controllable facial animations.
Given the limited diversity of facial emotions in existing speech-driven facial
animation training data, we further introduce an effective Expression Prompt
Augmentation (EPA) mechanism to enable the animation generator to support
unprecedented richness in style control. Comprehensive experiments illustrate
that our method accomplishes expressive facial animation generation and offers
enhanced flexibility in effectively conveying the desired style.

for the (ARMv8 and RISC-V) machine code of cryptographic protocols. We achieve
this by first transpiling the binary of protocols into an intermediate
representation and then performing a crypto-aware symbolic execution to
automatically extract a model of the protocol that represents all its execution
paths. Our symbolic execution resolves indirect jumps and supports bounded
loops using the loop-summarization technique, which we fully automate. The
extracted model is then translated into models amenable to automated

<p class="mathjax">Bug fixing holds significant importance in software development and
maintenance. Recent research has made notable progress in exploring the
potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatic bug fixing. However,
existing studies often overlook the collaborative nature of bug resolution,
treating it as a single-stage process. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel stage-wise framework named STEAM in this paper. The objective
of STEAM is to simulate the interactive behavior of multiple programmers
involved in various stages across the bug's life cycle. Taking inspiration from
bug management practices, we decompose the bug fixing task into four distinct
stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification.
These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to imitate the
collaborative abilities of programmers during the resolution of software bugs.
By harnessing the collective contribution, STEAM effectively enhances the
bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We implement STEAM by employing the powerful
dialogue-based LLM -- ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely adopted bug-fixing
benchmark demonstrates that STEAM has achieved a new state-of-the-art level of
bug-fixing performance.

<p class="mathjax">Over the last ten years, Patient-Derived Organoids (PDOs) emerged as the most
reliable technology to generate ex-vivo tumor avatars. PDOs retain the main
characteristics of their original tumor, making them a system of choice for
pre-clinical and clinical studies. In particular, PDOs are attracting interest
in the field of Functional Precision Medicine (FPM), which is based upon an
ex-vivo drug test in which living tumor cells (such as PDOs) from a specific
patient are exposed to a panel of anti-cancer drugs. Currently, the Adenosine
Triphosphate (ATP) based cell viability assay is the gold standard test to
assess the sensitivity of PDOs to drugs. The readout is measured at the end of
the assay from a global PDO population and therefore does not capture single
PDO responses and does not provide time resolution of drug effect. To this end,
in this study, we explore for the first time the use of powerful large
foundation models for the automatic processing of PDO data. In particular, we
propose a novel imaging-based high-throughput screening method to assess
real-time drug efficacy from a time-lapse microscopy video of PDOs. The
recently proposed SAM algorithm for segmentation and DINOv2 model are adapted
in a comprehensive pipeline for processing PDO microscopy frames. Moreover, an
attention mechanism is proposed for fusing temporal and spatial features in a
multiple instance learning setting to predict ATP. We report better results
than other non-time-resolved methods, indicating that the temporality of data
is an important factor for the prediction of ATP. Extensive ablations shed
light on optimizing the experimental setting and automating the prediction both
in real-time and for forecasting.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection is a task that performs position identification and label
classification of objects in images or videos. The information obtained through
this process plays an essential role in various tasks in the field of computer
vision. In object detection, the data utilized for training and validation
typically originate from public datasets that are well-balanced in terms of the
number of objects ascribed to each class in an image. However, in real-world
scenarios, handling datasets with much greater class imbalance, i.e., very
different numbers of objects for each class , is much more common, and this
imbalance may reduce the performance of object detection when predicting unseen
test images. In our study, thus, we propose a method that evenly distributes
the classes in an image for training and validation, solving the class
imbalance problem in object detection. Our proposed method aims to maintain a
uniform class distribution through multi-label stratification. We tested our
proposed method not only on public datasets that typically exhibit balanced
class distribution but also on custom datasets that may have imbalanced class
distribution. We found that our proposed method was more effective on datasets
containing severe imbalance and less data. Our findings indicate that the
proposed method can be effectively used on datasets with substantially
imbalanced class distribution.

<p class="mathjax">Realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims to reproduce perceptually
realistic image details from a low-quality input. The commonly used adversarial
training based Real-ISR methods often introduce unnatural visual artifacts and
fail to generate realistic textures for natural scene images. The recently
developed generative stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to
Real-ISR with pre-learned strong image priors. However, the existing methods
along this line either fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures or
resort to extra skipped connections to reproduce details, which requires
additional training in image space and limits their extension to other related
tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a
pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR as well
as personalized stylization. In specific, a pixel-aware cross attention module
is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in
pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract
degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with
image high level information. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with
a personalized one, our method can generate diverse stylized images without the
need to collect pairwise training data. PASD can be easily integrated into
existing diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. Experiments on Real-ISR and
personalized stylization demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach. The source code and models can be found at

<p class="mathjax">In current ML field models are getting larger and more complex, data we use
are also getting larger in quantity and higher in dimension, so in order to
train better models, save training time and computational resources, a good
Feature Selection (FS) method in preprocessing stage is necessary. Feature
importance (FI) is of great importance since it is the basis of feature
selection.
<br />This paper creatively introduces the calculation of PNS(the probability of
Necessity and Sufficiency) in Causality into quantifying feature importance and
creates new FI measuring methods: PN-FI, which means how much importance a
feature has in image recognition tasks, PS_FI that means how much importance a
feature has in image generating tasks, and PNS_FI which measures both.
<br />The main body of this paper is three RCTs, with whose results we show how
PS_FI, PN_FI and PNS_FI of three features: dog nose, dog eyes and dog mouth are
calculated. The FI values are intervals with tight upper and lower bounds.

<p class="mathjax">Process pattern discovery methods (PPDMs) aim at identifying patterns of
interest to users. Existing PPDMs typically are unsupervised and focus on a
single dimension of interest, such as discovering frequent patterns. We present
an interactive multi interest driven framework for process pattern discovery
aimed at identifying patterns that are optimal according to a multi-dimensional
analysis goal. The proposed approach is iterative and interactive, thus taking
experts knowledge into account during the discovery process. The paper focuses
on a concrete analysis goal, i.e., deriving process patterns that affect the
process outcome. We evaluate the approach on real world event logs in both
interactive and fully automated settings. The approach extracted meaningful
patterns validated by expert knowledge in the interactive setting. Patterns
extracted in the automated settings consistently led to prediction performance
comparable to or better than patterns derived considering single interest
dimensions without requiring user defined thresholds.

<p class="mathjax">Deep needle insertion to a target often poses a huge challenge, requiring a
combination of specialized skills, assistive technology, and extensive
training. One of the frequently encountered medical scenarios demanding such
expertise includes the needle insertion into a femoral vessel in the groin.
After the access to the femoral vessel, various medical procedures, such as
cardiac catheterization and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be
performed. However, even with the aid of Ultrasound imaging, achieving
successful insertion can necessitate multiple attempts due to the complexities
of anatomy and tissue deformation. To address this challenge, this paper
presents an innovative technology for needle tip real-time tracking, aiming for
enhanced needle insertion guidance. Specifically, our approach revolves around
the creation of scattering imaging using an optical fiber-equipped needle, and
uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithms to enable real-time
estimation of the needle tip's position and orientation during insertion
procedures. The efficacy of the proposed technology was rigorously evaluated
through three experiments. The first two experiments involved rubber and bacon
phantoms to simulate groin anatomy. The positional errors averaging 2.3+1.5mm
and 2.0+1.2mm, and the orientation errors averaging 0.2+0.11rad and
0.16+0.1rad. Furthermore, the system's capabilities were validated through
experiments conducted on fresh porcine phantom mimicking more complex
anatomical structures, yielding positional accuracy results of 3.2+3.1mm and
orientational accuracy of 0.19+0.1rad. Given the average femoral arterial
radius of 4 to 5mm, the proposed system is demonstrated with a great potential
for precise needle guidance in femoral artery insertion procedures. In
addition, the findings highlight the broader potential applications of the
system in the medical field.

<p class="mathjax">We aim to efficiently compute spreading speeds of
reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) fronts in divergence free random flows under
the Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (KPP) nonlinearity. We study a stochastic
interacting particle method (IPM) for the reduced principal eigenvalue
(Lyapunov exponent) problem of an associated linear advection-diffusion
operator with spatially random coefficients. The Fourier representation of the
random advection field and the Feynman-Kac (FK) formula of the principal
eigenvalue (Lyapunov exponent) form the foundation of our method implemented as
a genetic evolution algorithm. The particles undergo advection-diffusion, and
mutation/selection through a fitness function originated in the FK semigroup.
We analyze convergence of the algorithm based on operator splitting, present
numerical results on representative flows such as 2D cellular flow and 3D
Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flow under random perturbations. The 2D
examples serve as a consistency check with semi-Lagrangian computation. The 3D
results demonstrate that IPM, being mesh free and self-adaptive, is simple to
implement and efficient for computing front spreading speeds in the
advection-dominated regime for high-dimensional random flows on unbounded
domains where no truncation is needed.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-motion generation is a formidable task, aiming to produce human
motions that align with the input text while also adhering to human
capabilities and physical laws. While there have been advancements in diffusion
models, their application in discrete spaces remains underexplored. Current
methods often overlook the varying significance of different motions, treating
them uniformly. It is essential to recognize that not all motions hold the same
relevance to a particular textual description. Some motions, being more salient
and informative, should be given precedence during generation. In response, we
introduce a Priority-Centric Motion Discrete Diffusion Model (M2DM), which
utilizes a Transformer-based VQ-VAE to derive a concise, discrete motion
representation, incorporating a global self-attention mechanism and a
regularization term to counteract code collapse. We also present a motion
discrete diffusion model that employs an innovative noise schedule, determined
by the significance of each motion token within the entire motion sequence.
This approach retains the most salient motions during the reverse diffusion
process, leading to more semantically rich and varied motions. Additionally, we
formulate two strategies to gauge the importance of motion tokens, drawing from
both textual and visual indicators. Comprehensive experiments on the HumanML3D
and KIT-ML datasets confirm that our model surpasses existing techniques in
fidelity and diversity, particularly for intricate textual descriptions.

<p class="mathjax">Group regression is commonly used in 3D object detection to predict box
parameters of similar classes in a joint head, aiming to benefit from
similarities while separating highly dissimilar classes. For query-based
perception methods, this has, so far, not been feasible. We close this gap and
present a method to incorporate multi-class group regression, especially
designed for the 3D domain in the context of autonomous driving, into existing
attention and query-based perception approaches. We enhance a transformer based
joint object detection and tracking model with this approach, and thoroughly
evaluate its behavior and performance. For group regression, the classes of the
nuScenes dataset are divided into six groups of similar shape and prevalence,
each being regressed by a dedicated head. We show that the proposed method is
applicable to many existing transformer based perception approaches and can
bring potential benefits. The behavior of query group regression is thoroughly
analyzed in comparison to a unified regression head, e.g. in terms of
class-switching behavior and distribution of the output parameters. The
proposed method offers many possibilities for further research, such as in the
direction of deep multi-hypotheses tracking.

<p class="mathjax">Consistency regularization methods, such as R-Drop (Liang et al., 2021) and
CrossConST (Gao et al., 2023), have achieved impressive supervised and
zero-shot performance in the neural machine translation (NMT) field. Can we
also boost end-to-end (E2E) speech-to-text translation (ST) by leveraging
consistency regularization? In this paper, we conduct empirical studies on
intra-modal and cross-modal consistency and propose two training strategies,
SimRegCR and SimZeroCR, for E2E ST in regular and zero-shot scenarios.
Experiments on the MuST-C benchmark show that our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most translation directions. The
analyses prove that regularization brought by the intra-modal consistency,
instead of modality gap, is crucial for the regular E2E ST, and the cross-modal
consistency could close the modality gap and boost the zero-shot E2E ST
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Although not all bots are malicious, the vast majority of them are
responsible for spreading misinformation and manipulating the public opinion
about several issues, i.e., elections and many more. Therefore, the early
detection of social spambots is crucial. Although there have been proposed
methods for detecting bots in social media, there are still substantial
limitations. For instance, existing research initiatives still extract a large
number of features and train traditional machine learning algorithms or use
GloVe embeddings and train LSTMs. However, feature extraction is a tedious
procedure demanding domain expertise. Also, language models based on
transformers have been proved to be better than LSTMs. Other approaches create
large graphs and train graph neural networks requiring in this way many hours
for training and access to computational resources. To tackle these
limitations, this is the first study employing only the user description field
and images of three channels denoting the type and content of tweets posted by
the users. Firstly, we create digital DNA sequences, transform them to 3d
images, and apply pretrained models of the vision domain, including
EfficientNet, AlexNet, VGG16, etc. Next, we propose a multimodal approach,
where we use TwHIN-BERT for getting the textual representation of the user
description field and employ VGG16 for acquiring the visual representation for
the image modality. We propose three different fusion methods, namely
concatenation, gated multimodal unit, and crossmodal attention, for fusing the
different modalities and compare their performances. Extensive experiments
conducted on the Cresci '17 dataset demonstrate valuable advantages of our
introduced approaches over state-of-the-art ones reaching Accuracy up to
99.98%.

<p class="mathjax">Social media have great potential for enabling public discourse on important
societal issues. However, adverse effects, such as polarization and echo
chambers, greatly impact the benefits of social media and call for algorithms
that mitigate these effects. In this paper, we propose a novel problem
formulation aimed at slightly nudging users' social feeds in order to strike a
balance between relevance and diversity, thus mitigating the emergence of
polarization, without lowering the quality of the feed. Our approach is based
on re-weighting the relative importance of the accounts that a user follows, so
as to calibrate the frequency with which the content produced by various
accounts is shown to the user. We analyze the convexity properties of the
problem, demonstrating the non-matrix convexity of the objective function and
the convexity of the feasible set. To efficiently address the problem, we
develop a scalable algorithm based on projected gradient descent. We also prove
that our problem statement is a proper generalization of the undirected-case
problem so that our method can also be adopted for undirected social networks.
As a baseline for comparison in the undirected case, we develop a semidefinite
programming approach, which provides the optimal solution. Through extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the effectiveness
of our approach, which outperforms non-trivial baselines, underscoring its
ability to foster healthier and more cohesive online communities.

<p class="mathjax">We describe an efficient method for the approximation of functions using
radial basis functions (RBFs), and extend this to a solver for boundary value
problems on irregular domains. The method is based on RBFs with centers on a
regular grid defined on a bounding box, with some of the centers outside the
computational domain. The equation is discretized using collocation with
oversampling, with collocation points inside the domain only, resulting in a
rectangular linear system to be solved in a least squares sense. The goal of
this paper is the efficient solution of that rectangular system. We show that
the least squares problem splits into a regular part, which can be expedited
with the FFT, and a low rank perturbation, which is treated separately with a
direct solver. The rank of the perturbation is influenced by the irregular
shape of the domain and by the weak enforcement of boundary conditions at
points along the boundary. The solver extends the AZ algorithm which was
previously proposed for function approximation involving frames and other
overcomplete sets. The solver has near optimal log-linear complexity for
univariate problems, and loses optimality for higher-dimensional problems but
remains faster than a direct solver.

<p class="mathjax">Human pose and shape estimation (HPS) has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. While most existing studies focus on HPS from 2D images or videos
with inherent depth ambiguity, there are surging need to investigate HPS from
3D point clouds as depth sensors have been frequently employed in commercial
devices. However, real-world sensory 3D points are usually noisy and
incomplete, and also human bodies could have different poses of high diversity.
To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled framework, PointHPS, for
accurate 3D HPS from point clouds captured in real-world settings, which
iteratively refines point features through a cascaded architecture.
Specifically, each stage of PointHPS performs a series of downsampling and
upsampling operations to extract and collate both local and global cues, which
are further enhanced by two novel modules: 1) Cross-stage Feature Fusion (CFF)
for multi-scale feature propagation that allows information to flow effectively
through the stages, and 2) Intermediate Feature Enhancement (IFE) for
body-aware feature aggregation that improves feature quality after each stage.
To facilitate a comprehensive study under various scenarios, we conduct our
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks, comprising i) a dataset that
features diverse subjects and actions captured by real commercial sensors in a
laboratory environment, and ii) controlled synthetic data generated with
realistic considerations such as clothed humans in crowded outdoor scenes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointHPS, with its powerful point
feature extraction and processing scheme, outperforms State-of-the-Art methods
by significant margins across the board. Homepage:

<p class="mathjax">Graphlet counting is an important problem as it has numerous applications in
several fields, including social network analysis, biological network analysis,
transaction network analysis, etc. Most of the practical networks are dynamic.
A graphlet is a subgraph with a fixed number of vertices and can be induced or
non-induced. There are several works for counting graphlets in a static network
where graph topology never changes. Surprisingly, there have been no scalable
and practical algorithms for maintaining all fixed-sized graphlets in a dynamic
network where the graph topology changes over time. We are the first to propose
an efficient algorithm for maintaining graphlets in a fully dynamic network.
Our algorithm is efficient because (1) we consider only the region of changes
in the graph for updating the graphlet count, and (2) we use an efficient
algorithm for counting graphlets in the region of change. We show by
experimental evaluation that our technique is more than 10x faster than the
baseline approach.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized numerous application
fields since their introduction. Alongside this, advancements in mechanics and
electronics have simplified and decreased the cost of system design. As a
consequence, UAVs have dominated the global market across all sectors from
recreational products to military applications. However, the widespread use of
UAVs has also contributed to an increase in criminal activity involving them.
UAVs have become a common means of delivering narcotics, arms, and ammunition,
collecting sensitive personal information, and snooping in restricted areas,
among other activities. This could constitute a threat to national security.
Despite its growing significance, UAV forensics is still a relatively
unexplored field of study. In this paper, we present new insights on UAV
forensic analysis in terms of preliminary analysis, accessing the digital
containers of the UAV, and retrieving vital data. With the aid of a simulated
scenario, a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of retrieved data to
establish conclusions on the flight path, source of origin, recover flight
data, and acquire media file content is presented.

<p class="mathjax">Channel charting is an emerging self-supervised method that maps channel
state information (CSI) to a low-dimensional latent space, which represents
pseudo-positions of user equipments (UEs). While this latent space preserves
local geometry, i.e., nearby UEs are nearby in latent space, the
pseudo-positions are in arbitrary coordinates and global geometry is not
preserved. In order to enable channel charting in real-world coordinates, we
propose a novel bilateration loss for multipoint wireless systems in which only
the access point (AP) locations are known--no geometrical models or
ground-truth UE position information is required. The idea behind this
bilateration loss is to compare the received power at pairs of APs in order to
determine whether a UE should be placed closer to one AP or the other in latent
space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using channel vectors from a
commercial ray-tracer.

urban planning, forest inventory, and environmental monitoring. In this
article, we present an approach to creating tree maps by annotating them in 3D
point clouds. Point cloud representations allow the precise identification of
tree positions, particularly stem locations, and their heights. Our method
leverages human computational power through paid crowdsourcing, employing a web
tool designed to enable even non-experts to effectively tackle the task. The
primary focus of this paper is to discuss the web tool's development and
strategies to ensure high-quality tree annotations despite encountering noise
in the crowdsourced data. Following our methodology, we achieve quality
measures surpassing 90% for various challenging test sets of diverse
complexities. We emphasize that our tree map creation process, including
initial point cloud collection, can be completed within 1-2 days.

<p class="mathjax">Skeleton-based action segmentation requires recognizing composable actions in
untrimmed videos. Current approaches decouple this problem by first extracting
local visual features from skeleton sequences and then processing them by a
temporal model to classify frame-wise actions. However, their performances
remain limited as the visual features cannot sufficiently express composable
actions. In this context, we propose Latent Action Composition (LAC), a novel
self-supervised framework aiming at learning from synthesized composable
motions for skeleton-based action segmentation. LAC is composed of a novel
generation module towards synthesizing new sequences. Specifically, we design a
linear latent space in the generator to represent primitive motion. New
composed motions can be synthesized by simply performing arithmetic operations
on latent representations of multiple input skeleton sequences. LAC leverages
such synthesized sequences, which have large diversity and complexity, for
learning visual representations of skeletons in both sequence and frame spaces
via contrastive learning. The resulting visual encoder has a high expressive
power and can be effectively transferred onto action segmentation tasks by
end-to-end fine-tuning without the need for additional temporal models. We
conduct a study focusing on transfer-learning and we show that representations
learned from pre-trained LAC outperform the state-of-the-art by a large margin
on TSU, Charades, PKU-MMD datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance for
many language tasks, most of them can only handle texts a few thousand tokens
long, limiting their applications on longer sequence inputs, such as books,
reports, and codebases. Recent works have proposed methods to improve LLMs'
long context capabilities by extending context windows and more sophisticated
memory mechanisms. However, comprehensive benchmarks tailored for evaluating
long context understanding are lacking. In this paper, we introduce LongBench,
the first bilingual, multi-task benchmark for long context understanding,
enabling a more rigorous evaluation of long context understanding. LongBench
comprises 21 datasets across 6 task categories in both English and Chinese,
with an average length of 6,711 words (English) and 13,386 characters
(Chinese). These tasks cover key long-text application areas including
single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks,
and code completion. All datasets in LongBench are standardized into a unified
format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs. Upon
comprehensive evaluation of 8 LLMs on LongBench, we find that: (1) Commercial
model (GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k) outperforms other open-sourced models, but still
struggles on longer contexts. (2) Scaled position embedding and fine-tuning on
longer sequences lead to substantial improvement on long context understanding.
(3) Context compression technique such as retrieval brings improvement for
model with weak ability on long contexts, but the performance still lags behind
models that have strong long context understanding capability. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/THUDM/LongBench.

<p class="mathjax">Modern tourism in the 21st century is facing numerous challenges. Among these
the rapidly growing number of tourists visiting space-limited regions like
historical cities, museums and bottlenecks such as bridges is one of the
biggest. In this context, a proper and accurate prediction of tourism volume
and tourism flow within a certain area is important and critical for visitor
management tasks such as sustainable treatment of the environment and
prevention of overcrowding. Static flow control methods like conventional
low-level controllers or limiting access to overcrowded venues could not solve
the problem yet. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the performance of
state-of-the-art deep-learning methods such as RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers as
well as the classic statistical ARIMA method. Granular limited data supplied by
a tourism region is extended by exogenous data such as geolocation trajectories
of individual tourists, weather and holidays. In the field of visitor flow
prediction with sparse data, we are thereby capable of increasing the accuracy
of our predictions, incorporating modern input feature handling as well as
mapping geolocation data on top of discrete POI data.

<p class="mathjax">Computational agents support humans in many areas of life and are therefore
found in heterogeneous contexts. This means that agents operate in rapidly
changing environments and can be confronted with huge state and action spaces.
In order to perform services and carry out activities in a goal-oriented
manner, agents require prior knowledge and therefore have to develop and pursue
context-dependent policies. The problem is that prescribing policies in advance
is limited and inflexible, especially in dynamically changing environments.
Moreover, the context of an agent determines its choice of actions. Since the
environments in which agents operate can be stochastic and complex in terms of
the number of states and feasible actions, activities are usually modelled in a
simplified way by Markov decision processes so that agents with reinforcement
learning are able to learn policies that help to capture the context and act
accordingly to optimally perform activities. However, training policies for all
possible contexts using reinforcement learning is time-consuming. A requirement
and challenge for agents is to learn strategies quickly and respond immediately
in cross-context environments and applications. In this work, we propose a
novel simulation-based approach that enables a) the representation of
heterogeneous contexts through knowledge graphs and entity embeddings and b)
the context-aware composition of policies on demand by ensembles of agents
running in parallel. The evaluation we performed on the "Virtual Home" dataset
indicates that agents that need to seamlessly switch between different
contexts, can request on-the-fly composed policies that lead to the successful
completion of context-appropriate activities without having to learn these
policies in lengthy training steps and episodes, in contrast to agents that
apply reinforcement learning.

<p class="mathjax">Large models have emerged as the most recent groundbreaking achievements in
artificial intelligence, and particularly machine learning. However, when it
comes to graphs, large models have not achieved the same level of success as in
other fields, such as natural language processing and computer vision. In order
to promote applying large models for graphs forward, we present a perspective
paper to discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with developing
large graph models. First, we discuss the desired characteristics of large
graph models. Then, we present detailed discussions from three key
perspectives: representation basis, graph data, and graph models. In each
category, we provide a brief overview of recent advances and highlight the
remaining challenges together with our visions. Finally, we discuss valuable
applications of large graph models. We believe this perspective paper is able
to encourage further investigations into large graph models, ultimately pushing
us one step closer towards artificial general intelligence (AGI).

<p class="mathjax">This article addresses the problem of Ultra Reliable Low Latency
Communications (URLLC) in wireless networks, a framework with particularly
stringent constraints imposed by many Internet of Things (IoT) applications
from diverse sectors. We propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
scheduling algorithm, named NOMA-PPO, to solve the Non-Orthogonal Multiple
Access (NOMA) uplink URLLC scheduling problem involving strict deadlines. The
challenge of addressing uplink URLLC requirements in NOMA systems is related to
the combinatorial complexity of the action space due to the possibility to
schedule multiple devices, and to the partial observability constraint that we
impose to our algorithm in order to meet the IoT communication constraints and
be scalable. Our approach involves 1) formulating the NOMA-URLLC problem as a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the introduction of an
agent state, serving as a sufficient statistic of past observations and
actions, enabling a transformation of the POMDP into a Markov Decision Process
(MDP); 2) adapting the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to handle
the combinatorial action space; 3) incorporating prior knowledge into the
learning agent with the introduction of a Bayesian policy. Numerical results
reveal that not only does our approach outperform traditional multiple access
protocols and DRL benchmarks on 3GPP scenarios, but also proves to be robust
under various channel and traffic configurations, efficiently exploiting
inherent time correlations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the challenging problem of enabling reliable immersive
teleoperation in scenarios where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is remotely
controlled by an operator via a cellular network. Such scenarios can be quite
critical particularly when the UAV lacks advanced equipment (e.g., Lidar-based
auto stop) or when the network is subject to some performance constraints
(e.g., delay). To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel architecture
leveraging Digital Twin (DT) technology to create a virtual representation of
the physical environment. This virtual environment accurately mirrors the
physical world, accounting for 3D surroundings, weather constraints, and
network limitations. To enhance teleoperation, the UAV in the virtual
environment is equipped with advanced features that maybe absent in the real
UAV. Furthermore, the proposed architecture introduces an intelligent logic
that utilizes information from both virtual and physical environments to
approve, deny, or correct actions initiated by the UAV operator. This
anticipatory approach helps to mitigate potential risks. Through a series of
field trials, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in
significantly improving the reliability of UAV teleoperation.

<p class="mathjax">Visual bird's eye view (BEV) semantic segmentation helps autonomous vehicles
understand the surrounding environment only from images, including static
elements (e.g., roads) and dynamic elements (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians).
However, the high cost of annotation procedures of full-supervised methods
limits the capability of the visual BEV semantic segmentation, which usually
needs HD maps, 3D object bounding boxes, and camera extrinsic matrixes. In this
paper, we present a novel semi-supervised framework for visual BEV semantic
segmentation to boost performance by exploiting unlabeled images during the
training. A consistency loss that makes full use of unlabeled data is then
proposed to constrain the model on not only semantic prediction but also the
BEV feature. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective data augmentation
method named conjoint rotation which reasonably augments the dataset while
maintaining the geometric relationship between the front-view images and the
BEV semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse
datasets show that our semi-supervised framework can effectively improve
prediction accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
explores improving visual BEV semantic segmentation performance using unlabeled
data. The code will be publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">High-rate minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes are known to require a
large sub-packetization level, which can make meta-data management difficult
and hinder implementation in practical systems. A few maximum distance
separable (MDS) array code constructions have been proposed to attain a much
smaller sub-packetization level by sacrificing a bit of repair bandwidth.
However, to the best of our knowledge, only one construction by Guruswami et
al. can support the repair of a failed node without contacting all the
surviving nodes. This construction is certainly of theoretical interest but not
yet practical due to its requirement for very large code parameters. In this
paper, we propose a generic transformation that can convert any $(\overline{n},
\overline{k})$ MSR code with a repair degree of $\overline{d}&lt;\overline{n}-1$
into another $(n=s\overline{n},k)$ MDS array code that supports $d&lt;n-1$ with a
small sub-packetization level and $(1+\epsilon)$-optimal repair bandwidth
(i.e., $1+\epsilon$ times the optimal value) under a specific condition. We
obtain three MDS array codes with small sub-packetization levels and
$(1+\epsilon)$-optimal repair bandwidth by applying this transformation to
three known MSR codes. All the new MDS array codes have a small repair degree
of $d&lt;n-1$ and work for both small and large code parameters.

<p class="mathjax">5G led to a digital revolution for networks by leveraging virtualisation
techniques to manage software-based network functions through provided standard
interfaces, which have matured recently for cloud infrastructure that is widely
employed across domains and sectors. This undiscovered potential to adequately
respond to concurrent and specialised traffic demands is promising for a wide
spectrum of industries. Moreover, it exposes the networking ecosystem to
prospects beyond the traditional value chain. However, the configuration,
deployment and operation of a 5G network are challenging. Thus, different
scientific and research entities have built their own open, evolvable and
updateable testbed infrastructure that can be used for experimentation
purposes. Such testbeds enable different stakeholders to integrate new systems
or features exploiting new technologies, assess the performance of innovative
services, and customise operation policies to find optimal setups from a
cost-effective perspective. Furthermore, federations of infrastructure allow
for wider and more complex experiments to be performed in distributed domains.
However, numerous technical and procedural obstacles exist during the building
of 5G network testbeds. In addition, some technical barriers persist despite
the testing of alternatives and ongoing efforts within open-source systems and
commercial equipment portfolios. All these limitations and challenges are
relevant for experimenters and stakeholders as they attempt to determine the
scope of 5G set expectations.

<p class="mathjax">The objective of few-shot named entity recognition is to identify named
entities with limited labeled instances. Previous works have primarily focused
on optimizing the traditional token-wise classification framework, while
neglecting the exploration of information based on NER data characteristics. To
address this issue, we propose a Multi-Task Semantic Decomposition Framework
via Joint Task-specific Pre-training (MSDP) for few-shot NER. Drawing
inspiration from demonstration-based and contrastive learning, we introduce two
novel pre-training tasks: Demonstration-based Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
and Class Contrastive Discrimination. These tasks effectively incorporate
entity boundary information and enhance entity representation in Pre-trained
Language Models (PLMs). In the downstream main task, we introduce a multi-task
joint optimization framework with the semantic decomposing method, which
facilitates the model to integrate two different semantic information for
entity classification. Experimental results of two few-shot NER benchmarks
demonstrate that MSDP consistently outperforms strong baselines by a large
margin. Extensive analyses validate the effectiveness and generalization of
MSDP.

<p class="mathjax">People have long hoped for a conversational system that can assist in
real-life situations, and recent progress on large language models (LLMs) is
bringing this idea closer to reality. While LLMs are often impressive in
performance, their efficacy in real-world scenarios that demand expert
knowledge remains unclear. LLMs are believed to hold the most potential and
value in education, especially in the development of Artificial intelligence
(AI) based virtual teachers capable of facilitating language learning. Our
focus is centered on evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in the realm of education,
specifically in the areas of spoken language learning which encompass
phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition. We introduce a new
multiple-choice question dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in the
aforementioned scenarios, including understanding and application of spoken
language knowledge. In addition, we investigate the influence of various
prompting techniques such as zero- and few-shot method (prepending the question
with question-answer exemplars), chain-of-thought (CoT, think step-by-step),
in-domain exampler and external tools (Google, Wikipedia). We conducted
large-scale evaluation on popular LLMs (20 distinct models) using these
methods. We achieved significant performance improvements compared to the
zero-shot baseline in the practical questions reasoning (GPT-3.5, 49.1% -&gt;
63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% -&gt; 48.6%). We found that models of different
sizes have good understanding of concepts in phonetics, phonology, and second
language acquisition, but show limitations in reasoning for real-world
problems. Additionally, we also explore preliminary findings on conversational
communication.

<p class="mathjax">Learning operator mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces via
neural networks has attracted a considerable amount of attention in recent
years. In this work, we propose an interfaced operator network (IONet) to solve
parametric elliptic interface PDEs, where different coefficients, source terms
and boundary conditions are considered as input features. To capture the
discontinuities of both input functions and output solutions across the
interface, IONet divides the entire domain into several separate sub-domains
according to the interface, and leverages multiple branch networks and truck
networks. Each branch network extracts latent representations of input
functions at a fixed number of sensors on a specific sub-domain, and each truck
network is responsible for output solutions on one sub-domain. In addition,
tailored physics-informed loss of IONet is proposed to ensure physical
consistency, which greatly reduces the requirement for training datasets and
makes IONet effective without any paired input-output observations in the
interior of the computational domain. Extensive numerical studies show that
IONet outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep operator networks in terms of
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility.

<p class="mathjax">The coincidence similarity index, based on a combination of the Jaccard and
overlap similarity indices, has noticeable properties in comparing and
classifying data, including enhanced selectivity and sensitivity, intrinsic
normalization, and robustness to data perturbations and outliers. These
features allow multiset neurons, which are based on the coincidence similarity
operation, to perform effective pattern recognition applications, including the
challenging task of image segmentation. A few prototype points have been used
in previous related approaches to represent each pattern to be identified, each
of them being associated with respective multiset neurons. The segmentation of
the regions can then proceed by taking into account the outputs of these
neurons. The present work describes multilayer multiset neuronal networks
incorporating two or more layers of coincidence similarity neurons. In
addition, as a means to improve performance, this work also explores the
utilization of counter-prototype points, which are assigned to the image
regions to be avoided. This approach is shown to allow effective segmentation
of complex regions despite considering only one prototype and one
counter-prototype point. As reported here, the balanced accuracy landscapes to
be optimized in order to identify the weight of the neurons in subsequent
layers have been found to be relatively smooth, while typically involving more
than one attraction basin. The use of a simple gradient-based optimization
methodology has been demonstrated to effectively train the considered neural
networks with several architectures, at least for the given data type,
configuration of parameters, and network architecture.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of guaranteeing a fraction of the maximin-share (MMS)
when allocating a set of indivisible items to a set of agents with fractionally
subadditive (XOS) valuations. For XOS valuations, it has been previously shown
that for some instances no allocation can guarantee a fraction better than
$1/2$ of the maximin-share to all the agents. Also, a deterministic allocation
exists that guarantees $0.219225$ of the maximin-share to each agent. Our
results pertain to deterministic and randomized allocations. On the
deterministic side, we improve the best approximation guarantee for
fractionally subadditive valuations to $3/13 = 0.230769$. We develop new ideas
for allocating large items which might be of independent interest. Furthermore,
we investigate randomized algorithms and best-of-both-worlds fairness
guarantees. We propose a randomized allocation that is $1/4$-MMS ex-ante and
$1/8$-MMS ex-post for XOS valuations. Moreover, we prove an upper bound of
$3/4$ on the ex-ante guarantee for this class of valuations.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous vehicles are advanced driving systems that are well known for
being vulnerable to various adversarial attacks, compromising the vehicle's
safety, and posing danger to other road users. Rather than actively training
complex adversaries by interacting with the environment, there is a need to
first intelligently find and reduce the search space to only those states where
autonomous vehicles are found less confident. In this paper, we propose a
blackbox testing framework ReMAV using offline trajectories first to analyze
the existing behavior of autonomous vehicles and determine appropriate
thresholds for finding the probability of failure events. Our reward modeling
technique helps in creating a behavior representation that allows us to
highlight regions of likely uncertain behavior even when the baseline
autonomous vehicle is performing well. This approach allows for more efficient
testing without the need for computational and inefficient active adversarial
learning techniques. We perform our experiments in a high-fidelity urban
driving environment using three different driving scenarios containing single
and multi-agent interactions. Our experiment shows 35%, 23%, 48%, and 50%
increase in occurrences of vehicle collision, road objects collision,
pedestrian collision, and offroad steering events respectively by the
autonomous vehicle under test, demonstrating a significant increase in failure
events. We also perform a comparative analysis with prior testing frameworks
and show that they underperform in terms of training-testing efficiency,
finding total infractions, and simulation steps to identify the first failure
compared to our approach. The results show that the proposed framework can be
used to understand existing weaknesses of the autonomous vehicles under test in
order to only attack those regions, starting with the simplistic perturbation
models.

<p class="mathjax">Recent face presentation attack detection (PAD) leverages domain adaptation
(DA) and domain generalization (DG) techniques to address performance
degradation on unknown domains. However, DA-based PAD methods require access to
unlabeled target data, while most DG-based PAD solutions rely on a priori,
i.e., known domain labels. Moreover, most DA-/DG-based methods are
computationally intensive, demanding complex model architectures and/or
multi-stage training processes. This paper proposes to model face PAD as a
compound DG task from a causal perspective, linking it to model optimization.
We excavate the causal factors hidden in the high-level representation via
counterfactual intervention. Moreover, we introduce a class-guided MixStyle to
enrich feature-level data distribution within classes instead of focusing on
domain information. Both class-guided MixStyle and counterfactual intervention
components introduce no extra trainable parameters and negligible computational
resources. Extensive cross-dataset and analytic experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to state-of-the-art PADs.
The implementation and the trained weights are publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Mathematical methods are developed to characterize the asymptotics of
recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the number of hidden units, data samples in
the sequence, hidden state updates, and training steps simultaneously grow to
infinity. In the case of an RNN with a simplified weight matrix, we prove the
convergence of the RNN to the solution of an infinite-dimensional ODE coupled
with the fixed point of a random algebraic equation. The analysis requires
addressing several challenges which are unique to RNNs. In typical mean-field
applications (e.g., feedforward neural networks), discrete updates are of
magnitude $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the number of updates is
$\mathcal{O}(N)$. Therefore, the system can be represented as an Euler
approximation of an appropriate ODE/PDE, which it will converge to as $N
\rightarrow \infty$. However, the RNN hidden layer updates are
$\mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, RNNs cannot be represented as a discretization of
an ODE/PDE and standard mean-field techniques cannot be applied. Instead, we
develop a fixed point analysis for the evolution of the RNN memory states, with
convergence estimates in terms of the number of update steps and the number of
hidden units. The RNN hidden layer is studied as a function in a Sobolev space,
whose evolution is governed by the data sequence (a Markov chain), the
parameter updates, and its dependence on the RNN hidden layer at the previous
time step. Due to the strong correlation between updates, a Poisson equation
must be used to bound the fluctuations of the RNN around its limit equation.
These mathematical methods give rise to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) limits
for RNNs trained on data sequences as the number of data samples and size of
the neural network grow to infinity.

<p class="mathjax">We present an implementation of an online optimization algorithm for hitting
a predefined target when returning ping-pong balls with a table tennis robot.
The online algorithm optimizes over so-called interception policies, which
define the manner in which the robot arm intercepts the ball. In our case,
these are composed of the state of the robot arm (position and velocity) at
interception time. Gradient information is provided to the optimization
algorithm via the mapping from the interception policy to the landing point of
the ball on the table, which is approximated with a black-box and a grey-box
approach. Our algorithm is applied to a robotic arm with four degrees of
freedom that is driven by pneumatic artificial muscles. As a result, the robot
arm is able to return the ball onto any predefined target on the table after
about 2-5 iterations. We highlight the robustness of our approach by showing
rapid convergence with both the black-box and the grey-box gradients. In
addition, the small number of iterations required to reach close proximity to
the target also underlines the sample efficiency. A demonstration video can be
found here: https://youtu.be/VC3KJoCss0k.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel time-frequency joint learning method for
speech emotion recognition, called Time-Frequency Transformer. Its advantage is
that the Time-Frequency Transformer can excavate global emotion patterns in the
time-frequency domain of speech signal while modeling the local emotional
correlations in the time domain and frequency domain respectively. For the
purpose, we first design a Time Transformer and Frequency Transformer to
capture the local emotion patterns between frames and inside frequency bands
respectively, so as to ensure the integrity of the emotion information modeling
in both time and frequency domains. Then, a Time-Frequency Transformer is
proposed to mine the time-frequency emotional correlations through the local
time-domain and frequency-domain emotion features for learning more
discriminative global speech emotion representation. The whole process is a
time-frequency joint learning process implemented by a series of Transformer
models. Experiments on IEMOCAP and CASIA databases indicate that our proposed
method outdoes the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Change detection (CD) is a fundamental and important task for monitoring the
land surface dynamics in the earth observation field. Existing deep
learning-based CD methods typically extract bi-temporal image features using a
weight-sharing Siamese encoder network and identify change regions using a
decoder network. These CD methods, however, still perform far from
satisfactorily as we observe that 1) deep encoder layers focus on irrelevant
background regions and 2) the models' confidence in the change regions is
inconsistent at different decoder stages. The first problem is because deep
encoder layers cannot effectively learn from imbalanced change categories using
the sole output supervision, while the second problem is attributed to the lack
of explicit semantic consistency preservation. To address these issues, we
design a novel similarity-aware attention flow network (SAAN). SAAN
incorporates a similarity-guided attention flow module with deeply supervised
similarity optimization to achieve effective change detection. Specifically, we
counter the first issue by explicitly guiding deep encoder layers to discover
semantic relations from bi-temporal input images using deeply supervised
similarity optimization. The extracted features are optimized to be
semantically similar in the unchanged regions and dissimilar in the changing
regions. The second drawback can be alleviated by the proposed
similarity-guided attention flow module, which incorporates similarity-guided
attention modules and attention flow mechanisms to guide the model to focus on
discriminative channels and regions. We evaluated the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method by conducting experiments on a
wide range of CD tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves excellent performance on several CD tasks, with discriminative
features and semantic consistency preserved.

the Jiles-Atherton Model used to simulate the first magnetization curve and
hysteresis loop in ferromagnetic materials. The Jiles-Atherton Model is an
important tool in engineering applications due to its relatively simple
differential formulation. However, determining the simulation parameters for
the anhysteretic curve is challenging. Several methods have been proposed,
primarily based on mathematical aspects of the anhysteretic and first
magnetization curves and hysteresis loops. This paper focuses on finding the
magnetic moments of the material, which are used to define the simulation
parameters for its anhysteretic curve. The proposed method involves using the
susceptibility of the material and a linear approximation of a paramagnet to
find the magnetic moments. The simulation parameters can then be found based on
the magnetic moments. The method is validated theoretically and experimentally
and offers a more physical approach to finding simulation parameters for the
anhysteretic curve and a simplified way of determining the magnetic moments of
the material.

<p class="mathjax">Existing Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) methods typically require
expensive pixel-level or box-level annotations for supervision. In this paper,
we observe that the referring texts used in RIS already provide sufficient
information to localize the target object. Hence, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised RIS framework to formulate the target localization problem as
a classification process to differentiate between positive and negative text
expressions. While the referring text expressions for an image are used as
positive expressions, the referring text expressions from other images can be
used as negative expressions for this image. Our framework has three main
novelties. First, we propose a bilateral prompt method to facilitate the
classification process, by harmonizing the domain discrepancy between visual
and linguistic features. Second, we propose a calibration method to reduce
noisy background information and improve the correctness of the response maps
for target object localization. Third, we propose a positive response map
selection strategy to generate high-quality pseudo-labels from the enhanced
response maps, for training a segmentation network for RIS inference. For
evaluation, we propose a new metric to measure localization accuracy.
Experiments on four benchmarks show that our framework achieves promising
performances to existing fully-supervised RIS methods while outperforming
state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods adapted from related areas. Code is
available at https://github.com/fawnliu/TRIS.

<p class="mathjax">Turnkey technology has emerged as a game-changing tool in cyber warfare,
offering state and non-state actors unprecedented access to advanced cyber
capabilities. The advantages of turnkey technology include rapid deployment and
adaptability, lower costs and resource requirements, the democratization of
cyber warfare capabilities, and enhanced offensive and defensive strategies.
However, turnkey technology also introduces significant risks, such as the
proliferation of cyber weapons, ethical considerations, potential collateral
damage, escalation of conflicts, and legal ramifications. This paper provides a
unique perspective on the implications of turnkey technology in cyber warfare,
highlighting its advantages, risks, and challenges, as well as the potential
strategies for mitigating these concerns. The research's novelty lies in
examining real-world examples and proposing a multifaceted approach to address
the challenges associated with turnkey technology in cyber warfare. This
approach focuses on developing effective cybersecurity measures, establishing
international norms and regulations, promoting responsible use and development
of turnkey technology, and enhancing global cooperation on cyber warfare
issues. By adopting this accountable and balanced approach, governments,
organizations, and the international community can work together to create a
more secure and stable digital environment, leveraging the benefits of turnkey
technology while minimizing the associated risks and challenges.

<p class="mathjax">This paper provides a summary of the 281 sorties that were flown by the 10
different models of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) at Hurricane Ian, and
the failures made in the field. These 281 sorties, supporting 44 missions,
represents the largest use of sUAS in a disaster to date (previously Hurricane
Florence with 260 sorties). The sUAS operations at Hurricane Ian differ
slightly from prior operations as they included the first documented uses of
drones performing interior search for victims, and the first use of a VTOL
fixed wing aircraft during a large scale disaster. However, there are
substantive similarities to prior drone operations. Most notably, rotorcraft
continue to perform the vast majority of flights, wireless data transmission
capacity continues to be a limitation, and the lack of centralized control for
unmanned and manned aerial systems continues to cause operational friction.
This work continues by documenting the failures, both human and technological
made in the field and concludes with a discussion summarizing potential areas
for further work to improve sUAS response to large scale disasters.

<p class="mathjax">The flexible-position multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), such as fluid
antennas and movable antennas, is a promising technology for future wireless
communications. This is due to the fact that the positions of antennas at the
transceiver and reflector can be dynamically optimized to achieve better
channel conditions and, as such, can provide high spectral efficiency (SE) and
energy efficiency (EE) gains with fewer antennas. In this article, we introduce
the fundamentals of flexibleposition MIMO systems, including hardware design,
structure design, and potential applications. We shall demonstrate that
flexible-position MIMO, using fewer flexible antennas, can match the channel
hardening achieved by a large number of fixed antennas. We will then analyze
the SE-EE relationship for flexible-position MIMO and fixed-position MIMO.
Furthermore, we will design the optimal trajectory of flexible antennas to
maximize system sum SE or total EE at a fixed travel distance of each antenna.
Finally, several important research directions regarding flexible-position MIMO
communications are presented to facilitate further investigation.

<p class="mathjax">Manually reading and logging gauge data is time inefficient, and the effort
increases according to the number of gauges available. We present a computer
vision pipeline that automates the reading of analog gauges. We propose a
two-stage CNN pipeline that identifies the key structural components of an
analog gauge and outputs an angular reading. To facilitate the training of our
approach, a synthetic dataset is generated thus obtaining a set of realistic
analog gauges with their corresponding annotation. To validate our proposal, an
additional real-world dataset was collected with 4.813 manually curated images.
When compared against state-of-the-art methodologies, our method shows a
significant improvement of 4.55 in the average error, which is a 52% relative
improvement. The resources for this project will be made available at:

<p class="mathjax">Evolutionary change over time in the context of data pipelines is certain,
especially with regard to the structure and semantics of data as well as to the
pipeline operators. Dealing with these changes, i.e. providing long-term
maintenance, is costly. The present work explores the need for evolution
capabilities within pipeline frameworks. In this context dealing with evolution
is defined as a two-step process consisting of self-awareness and
self-adaption. Furthermore, a conceptual requirements model is provided, which
encompasses criteria for self-awareness and self-adaption as well as covering
the dimensions data, operator, pipeline and environment. A lack of said
capabilities in existing frameworks exposes a major gap. Filling this gap will
be a significant contribution for practitioners and scientists alike. The
present work envisions and lays the foundation for a framework which can handle
evolutionary change.

<p class="mathjax">Smartphone manufacturer provided default features (e.g., default location
services, iCloud, Google Assistant, ad tracking) enhance the usability and
extend the functionality of these devices. Prior studies have highlighted
smartphone vulnerabilities and how users' data can be harvested without their
knowledge. However, little is known about manufacturer provided default
features in this regard -- their usability concerning configuring them during
usage, and how users perceive them with regards to privacy. To bridge this gap,
we conducted a task-based study with 27 Android and iOS smartphone users in
order to learn about their perceptions, concerns and practices, and to
understand the usability of these features with regards to privacy. We explored
the following: users' awareness of these features, why and when do they change
the settings of these features, the challenges they face while configuring
these features, and finally the mitigation strategies they adopt. Our findings
reveal that users of both platforms have limited awareness of these features
and their privacy implications. Awareness of these features does not imply that
a user can easily locate and adjust them when needed.
<br />Furthermore, users attribute their failure to configure default features to
hidden controls and insufficient knowledge on how to configure them. To cope
with difficulties of finding controls, users employ various coping strategies,
some of which are platform specific but most often applicable to both
platforms. However, some of these coping strategies leave users vulnerable.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) is a widely adopted approach in industry
due to rare anomaly occurrences and data imbalance. A desirable characteristic
of an UAD model is contained generalization ability which excels in the
reconstruction of seen normal patterns but struggles with unseen anomalies.
Recent studies have pursued to contain the generalization capability of their
UAD models in reconstruction from different perspectives, such as design of
neural network (NN) structure and training strategy. In contrast, we note that
containing of generalization ability in reconstruction can also be obtained
simply from steep-shaped loss landscape. Motivated by this, we propose a loss
landscape sharpening method by amplifying the reconstruction loss, dubbed Loss
AMPlification (LAMP). LAMP deforms the loss landscape into a steep shape so the
reconstruction error on unseen anomalies becomes greater. Accordingly, the
anomaly detection performance is improved without any change of the NN
architecture. Our findings suggest that LAMP can be easily applied to any
reconstruction error metrics in UAD settings where the reconstruction model is
trained with anomaly-free samples only.

<p class="mathjax">Despite significant advances in deep learning, models often struggle to
generalize well to new, unseen domains, especially when training data is
limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for
distribution-aware latent augmentation that leverages the relationships across
samples to guide the augmentation procedure. Our approach first degrades the
samples stochastically in the latent space, mapping them to augmented labels,
and then restores the samples from their corrupted versions during training.
This process confuses the classifier in the degradation step and restores the
overall class distribution of the original samples, promoting diverse
intra-class/cross-domain variability. We extensively evaluate our approach on a
diverse set of datasets and tasks, including domain generalization benchmarks
and medical imaging datasets with strong domain shift, where we show our
approach achieves significant improvements over existing methods for latent
space augmentation. We further show that our method can be flexibly adapted to
long-tail recognition tasks, demonstrating its versatility in building more
generalizable models. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Rapid progress is being made in developing large, pretrained, task-agnostic
foundational vision models such as CLIP, ALIGN, DINOv2, etc. In fact, we are
approaching the point where these models do not have to be finetuned
downstream, and can simply be used in zero-shot or with a lightweight probing
head. Critically, given the complexity of working at this scale, there is a
bottleneck where relatively few organizations in the world are executing the
training then sharing the models on centralized platforms such as HuggingFace
and torch.hub. The goal of this work is to identify several key adversarial
vulnerabilities of these models in an effort to make future designs more
robust. Intuitively, our attacks manipulate deep feature representations to
fool an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector which will be required when using
these open-world-aware models to solve closed-set downstream tasks. Our methods
reliably make in-distribution (ID) images (w.r.t. a downstream task) be
predicted as OOD and vice versa while existing in extremely
low-knowledge-assumption threat models. We show our attacks to be potent in
whitebox and blackbox settings, as well as when transferred across foundational
model types (e.g., attack DINOv2 with CLIP)! This work is only just the
beginning of a long journey towards adversarially robust foundational vision
models.

following a "detect, then describe" approach, where the descriptor loss is
evaluated only at those locations where keypoints have been selected by the

<p class="mathjax">As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role
in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical
databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias,
which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially
more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic
relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this
issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which
addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender
systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth
listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should
be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful
music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music
domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing
recommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our
evaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms
existing fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of
lesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed
methodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and
improving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems.

<p class="mathjax">The growing adoption of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) presents a
transformative opportunity for revolutionizing transportation energy systems.
The shift towards electrifying transportation aims to curb environmental
concerns related to fossil fuel consumption. This necessitates efficient energy
management systems (EMS) to optimize energy efficiency. The evolution of EMS
from HEVs to connected hybrid electric vehicles (CHEVs) represent a pivotal
shift. For HEVs, EMS now confronts the intricate energy cooperation
requirements of CHEVs, necessitating advanced algorithms for route
optimization, charging coordination, and load distribution. Challenges persist
in both domains, including optimal energy utilization for HEVs, and cooperative
eco-driving control (CED) for CHEVs across diverse vehicle types. Reinforcement
learning (RL) stands out as a promising tool for addressing these challenges at
hand. Specifically, within the realm of CHEVs, the application of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) emerges as a powerful approach for effectively
tackling the intricacies of CED control. Despite extensive research, few
reviews span from individual vehicles to multi-vehicle scenarios. This review
bridges the gap, highlighting challenges, advancements, and potential
contributions of RL-based solutions for future sustainable transportation
systems.

<p class="mathjax">Segment Anything Model (SAM) has received remarkable attention as it offers a
powerful and versatile solution for object segmentation in images. However,
fine-tuning SAM for downstream segmentation tasks under different scenarios
remains a challenge, as the varied characteristics of different scenarios
naturally requires diverse model parameter spaces. Most existing fine-tuning
methods attempt to bridge the gaps among different scenarios by introducing a
set of new parameters to modify SAM's original parameter space. Unlike these
works, in this paper, we propose fine-tuning SAM efficiently by parameter space
reconstruction (SAM-PARSER), which introduce nearly zero trainable parameters
during fine-tuning. In SAM-PARSER, we assume that SAM's original parameter
space is relatively complete, so that its bases are able to reconstruct the
parameter space of a new scenario. We obtain the bases by matrix decomposition,
and fine-tuning the coefficients to reconstruct the parameter space tailored to
the new scenario by an optimal linear combination of the bases. Experimental
results show that SAM-PARSER exhibits superior segmentation performance across
various scenarios, while reducing the number of trainable parameters by
$\approx 290$ times compared with current parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning harnesses massive parallel floating-point processing to train
and evaluate large neural networks. Trends indicate that deeper and larger
neural networks with an increasing number of parameters achieve higher accuracy
than smaller neural networks. This performance improvement, which often
requires heavy compute for both training and evaluation, eventually needs to
translate well to resource-constrained hardware for practical value. Structured
pruning asserts that while large networks enable us to find solutions to
complex computer vision problems, a smaller, computationally efficient
sub-network can be derived from the large neural network that retains model
accuracy but significantly improves computational efficiency.
<br />We generalize structured pruning with algorithms for network augmentation,
pruning, sub-network collapse and removal. In addition, we demonstrate
efficient and stable convergence up to 93% sparsity and 95% FLOPs reduction
without loss of inference accuracy using with continuous relaxation matching or
exceeding the state of the art for all structured pruning methods. The
resulting CNN executes efficiently on GPU hardware without computationally
expensive sparse matrix operations. We achieve this with routine automatable
operations on classification and segmentation problems using CIFAR-10,
ImageNet, and CityScapes datasets with the ResNet and U-NET network
architectures.

<p class="mathjax">This paper jointly considers privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in
decentralized learning. In a decentralized network, honest-but-curious agents
faithfully follow the prescribed algorithm, but expect to infer their
neighbors' private data from messages received during the learning process,
while dishonest-and-Byzantine agents disobey the prescribed algorithm, and
deliberately disseminate wrong messages to their neighbors so as to bias the
learning process. For this novel setting, we investigate a generic
privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) framework, in which Gaussian noise is injected to preserve
privacy and robust aggregation rules are adopted to counteract Byzantine
attacks. We analyze its learning error and privacy guarantee, discovering an
essential tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in
decentralized learning -- the learning error caused by defending against
Byzantine attacks is exacerbated by the Gaussian noise added to preserve
privacy. Numerical experiments are conducted and corroborate our theoretical
findings.

<p class="mathjax">The introduction of ChatGPT and the subsequent improvement of Large Language
Models (LLMs) have prompted more and more individuals to turn to the use of
ChatBots, both for information and assistance with decision-making. However,
the information the user is after is often not formulated by these ChatBots
objectively enough to be provided with a definite, globally accepted answer.
<br />Controversial topics, such as "religion", "gender identity", "freedom of
speech", and "equality", among others, can be a source of conflict as partisan
or biased answers can reinforce preconceived notions or promote disinformation.
By exposing ChatGPT to such debatable questions, we aim to understand its level
of awareness and if existing models are subject to socio-political and/or
economic biases. We also aim to explore how AI-generated answers compare to
human ones. For exploring this, we use a dataset of a social media platform
created for the purpose of debating human-generated claims on polemic subjects
among users, dubbed Kialo.
<br />Our results show that while previous versions of ChatGPT have had important
issues with controversial topics, more recent versions of ChatGPT
(gpt-3.5-turbo) are no longer manifesting significant explicit biases in
several knowledge areas. In particular, it is well-moderated regarding economic
aspects. However, it still maintains degrees of implicit libertarian leaning
toward right-winged ideals which suggest the need for increased moderation from
the socio-political point of view. In terms of domain knowledge on
controversial topics, with the exception of the "Philosophical" category,
ChatGPT is performing well in keeping up with the collective human level of
knowledge. Finally, we see that sources of Bing AI have slightly more tendency
to the center when compared to human answers. All the analyses we make are
generalizable to other types of biases and domains.

<p class="mathjax">Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging technology is commonly used to provide
24-hour all-weather earth observation. However, it still has some drawbacks in
SAR target classification, especially in fine-grained classification of
aircraft: aircrafts in SAR images have large intra-class diversity and
inter-class similarity; the number of effective samples is insufficient and
it's hard to annotate. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel
multi-modal self-supervised network (MS-Net) for fine-grained classification of
aircraft. Firstly, in order to entirely exploit the potential of multi-modal
information, a two-sided path feature extraction network (TSFE-N) is
constructed to enhance the image feature of the target and obtain the domain
knowledge feature of text mode. Secondly, a contrastive self-supervised
learning (CSSL) framework is employed to effectively learn useful
label-independent feature from unbalanced data, a similarity per-ception loss
(SPloss) is proposed to avoid network overfitting. Finally, TSFE-N is used as
the encoder of CSSL to obtain the classification results. Through a large
number of experiments, our MS-Net can effectively reduce the difficulty of
classifying similar types of aircrafts. In the case of no label, the proposed
algorithm achieves an accuracy of 88.46% for 17 types of air-craft
classification task, which has pioneering significance in the field of
fine-grained classification of aircraft in SAR images.

<p class="mathjax">In stark contrast to the case of images, finding a concise, learnable
discrete representation of 3D surfaces remains a challenge. In particular,
while polygon meshes are arguably the most common surface representation used
in geometry processing, their irregular and combinatorial structure often make
them unsuitable for learning-based applications. In this work, we present
VoroMesh, a novel and differentiable Voronoi-based representation of watertight
3D shape surfaces. From a set of 3D points (called generators) and their
associated occupancy, we define our boundary representation through the Voronoi
diagram of the generators as the subset of Voronoi faces whose two associated
(equidistant) generators are of opposite occupancy: the resulting polygon mesh
forms a watertight approximation of the target shape's boundary. To learn the
position of the generators, we propose a novel loss function, dubbed VoroLoss,
that minimizes the distance from ground truth surface samples to the closest
faces of the Voronoi diagram which does not require an explicit construction of
the entire Voronoi diagram. A direct optimization of the Voroloss to obtain
generators on the Thingi32 dataset demonstrates the geometric efficiency of our
representation compared to axiomatic meshing algorithms and recent
learning-based mesh representations. We further use VoroMesh in a
learning-based mesh prediction task from input SDF grids on the ABC dataset,
and show comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while guaranteeing
closed output surfaces free of self-intersections.

<p class="mathjax">Deep-learning models for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation exhibit limited
generalization capabilities when trained and tested on data captured with
different sensors or in varying environments due to domain shift. Domain
adaptation methods can be employed to mitigate this domain shift, for instance,
by simulating sensor noise, developing domain-agnostic generators, or training
point cloud completion networks. Often, these methods are tailored for range
view maps or necessitate multi-modal input. In contrast, domain adaptation in
the image domain can be executed through sample mixing, which emphasizes input
data manipulation rather than employing distinct adaptation modules. In this
study, we introduce compositional semantic mixing for point cloud domain
adaptation, representing the first unsupervised domain adaptation technique for
point cloud segmentation based on semantic and geometric sample mixing. We
present a two-branch symmetric network architecture capable of concurrently
processing point clouds from a source domain (e.g. synthetic) and point clouds
from a target domain (e.g. real-world). Each branch operates within one domain
by integrating selected data fragments from the other domain and utilizing
semantic information derived from source labels and target (pseudo) labels.
Additionally, our method can leverage a limited number of human point-level
annotations (semi-supervised) to further enhance performance. We assess our
approach in both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real scenarios using LiDAR
datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

<p class="mathjax">Ranking schemes drive many real-world decisions, like, where to study, whom
to hire, what to buy, etc. Many of these decisions often come with high
consequences. For example, a university can be deemed less prestigious if not
featured in a top-k list, and consumers might not even explore products that do
not get recommended to buyers. At the heart of most of these decisions are
opaque ranking schemes, which dictate the ordering of data entities, but their
internal logic is inaccessible or proprietary. Drawing inferences about the
ranking differences is like a guessing game to the stakeholders, like, the
rankees (i.e., the entities who are ranked, like product companies) and the
decision-makers (i.e., who use the rankings, like buyers). In this paper, we
aim to enable transparency in ranking interpretation by using algorithmic
rankers that learn from available data and by enabling human reasoning about
the learned ranking differences using explainable AI (XAI) methods. To realize
this aim, we leverage the exploration-explanation paradigm of human-data
interaction to let human stakeholders explore subsets and groupings of complex
multi-attribute ranking data using visual explanations of model fit and
attribute influence on rankings. We realize this explanation paradigm for
transparent ranking interpretation in TRIVEA, a visual analytic system that is
fueled by: i) visualizations of model fit derived from algorithmic rankers that
learn the associations between attributes and rankings from available data and
ii) visual explanations derived from XAI methods that help abstract important
patterns, like, the relative influence of attributes in different ranking
ranges. Using TRIVEA, end users not trained in data science have the agency to
transparently reason about the global and local behavior of the rankings
without the need to open black-box ranking models and develop confidence in the
resulting attribute-based inferences. We demonstrate the efficacy of TRIVEA
using multiple usage scenarios and subjective feedback from researchers with
diverse domain expertise. Keywords: Visual Analytics, Learning-to-Rank,

developers accidentally release new versions of their packages that are not
backwards-compatible. Such releases can directly impact projects which are
using their packages, causing bugs or even compilation errors when using the

(itself) a built-in mechanism for enforcing semantic versioning.
<br />The aim of this thesis is to describe the development of a tool for Rust
programmers to reduce the chances of publishing a new version of the code that
violates semantic versioning.
<br />There are already on-going plans to bundle this tool into the language's
standard development toolchain. It would make it commonly used and therefore
help users to safely get bug fixes, security patches and new functionality,
without worrying about their app being broken by a dependency change.

<p class="mathjax">Local differential privacy techniques for numerical data typically transform
a dataset to ensure a bound on the likelihood that, given a query, a malicious
user could infer information on the original samples. Queries are often solely
based on users and their requirements, limiting the design of the perturbation
to processes that, while privatizing the results, do not jeopardize their
usefulness. In this paper, we propose a privatization technique called Zeal,
where perturbator and aggregator are designed as a unit, resulting in a locally
differentially private mechanism that, by-design, improves the compressibility
of the perturbed dataset compared to the original, saves on transmitted bits
for data collection and protects against a privacy vulnerabilities due to
floating point arithmetic that affect other state-of-the-art schemes. We prove
that the utility error on querying the average is invariant to the bias
introduced by Zeal in a wide range of conditions, and that under the same
circumstances, Zeal also guarantee protection against the aforementioned
vulnerability. Our numerical results show up to 94% improvements in compression
and up to 95% more efficient data transmissions, while keeping utility errors
within 2%.

<p class="mathjax">This study extensively compares conventional machine learning methods and
deep learning for condition monitoring tasks using an AutoML toolbox. The
experiments reveal consistent high accuracy in random K-fold cross-validation
scenarios across all tested models. However, when employing leave-one-group-out
(LOGO) cross-validation on the same datasets, no clear winner emerges,
indicating the presence of domain shift in real-world scenarios. Additionally,
the study assesses the scalability and interpretability of conventional methods
and neural networks. Conventional methods offer explainability with their
modular structure aiding feature identification. In contrast, neural networks
require specialized interpretation techniques like occlusion maps to visualize
important regions in the input data. Finally, the paper highlights the
significance of feature selection, particularly in condition monitoring tasks
with limited class variations. Low-complexity models prove sufficient for such
tasks, as only a few features from the input signal are typically needed. In
summary, these findings offer crucial insights into the strengths and
limitations of various approaches, providing valuable benchmarks and
identifying the most suitable methods for condition monitoring applications,
thereby enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">We propose the use of conversational GPT models for easy and quick few-shot
text classification in the financial domain using the Banking77 dataset. Our
approach involves in-context learning with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which minimizes
the technical expertise required and eliminates the need for expensive GPU
computing while yielding quick and accurate results. Additionally, we fine-tune
other pre-trained, masked language models with SetFit, a recent contrastive
learning technique, to achieve state-of-the-art results both in full-data and
few-shot settings. Our findings show that querying GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can
outperform fine-tuned, non-generative models even with fewer examples. However,
subscription fees associated with these solutions may be considered costly for
small organizations. Lastly, we find that generative models perform better on
the given task when shown representative samples selected by a human expert
rather than when shown random ones. We conclude that a) our proposed methods
offer a practical solution for few-shot tasks in datasets with limited label
availability, and b) our state-of-the-art results can inspire future work in
the area.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic locomotion in legged robots is close to industrial collaboration, but
a lack of standardized testing obstructs commercialization. The issues are not
merely political, theoretical, or algorithmic but also physical, indicating
limited studies and comprehension regarding standard testing infrastructure and
equipment. For decades, the approaches we have been testing legged robots were
rarely standardizable with hand-pushing, foot-kicking, rope-dragging,
stick-poking, and ball-swinging. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing
the use of the linear impactor, a well-established tool in other standardized
testing disciplines, to serve as an adaptive, repeatable, and fair disturbance
rejection testing equipment for legged robots. A pneumatic linear impactor is
also adopted for the case study involving the humanoid robot Digit. Three
locomotion controllers are examined, including a commercial one, using a
walking-in-place task against frontal impacts. The statistically best
controller was able to withstand the impact momentum (26.376 kg$\cdot$m/s) on
par with a reported average effective momentum from straight punches by Olympic
boxers (26.506 kg$\cdot$m/s). Moreover, the case study highlights other
anti-intuitive observations, demonstrations, and implications that, to the best
of the authors' knowledge, are first-of-its-kind revealed in real-world testing
of legged robots.

<p class="mathjax">Cell-free communication has the potential to significantly improve grant-free
transmission in massive machine-type communication, wherein multiple access
points jointly serve a large number of user equipments to improve coverage and
spectral efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for joint
active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD)
for massive grant-free transmission in cell-free systems. We formulate an
optimization problem for joint AUD, CE, and DD by considering both the sparsity
of the data matrix, which arises from intermittent user activity, and the
sparsity of the effective channel matrix, which arises from intermittent user
activity and large-scale fading. We approximately solve this optimization
problem with a box-constrained forward-backward splitting algorithm, which
significantly improves AUD, CE, and DD performance. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through simulation experiments.

<p class="mathjax">The potential to provide patients with faster information access while
allowing medical specialists to concentrate on critical tasks makes medical
domain dialog agents appealing. However, the integration of large-language
models (LLMs) into these agents presents certain limitations that may result in
serious consequences. This paper investigates the challenges and risks of using
GPT-3-based models for medical question-answering (MedQA). We perform several
evaluations contextualized in terms of standard medical principles. We provide
a procedure for manually designing patient queries to stress-test high-risk
limitations of LLMs in MedQA systems. Our analysis reveals that LLMs fail to
respond adequately to these queries, generating erroneous medical information,
unsafe recommendations, and content that may be considered offensive.

<p class="mathjax">Fluent human-robot collaboration requires a robot teammate to understand,
learn, and adapt to the human's psycho-physiological state. Such collaborations
require a computing system that monitors human physiological signals during
human-robot collaboration (HRC) to quantitatively estimate a human's level of
comfort, which we have termed in this research as comfortability index (CI) and
uncomfortability index (unCI). Subjective metrics (surprise, anxiety, boredom,
calmness, and comfortability) and physiological signals were collected during a
human-robot collaboration experiment that varied robot behavior. The emotion
circumplex model is adapted to calculate the CI from the participant's
quantitative data as well as physiological data. To estimate CI/unCI from
physiological signals, time features were extracted from electrocardiogram
(ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and pupillometry signals. In this
research, we successfully adapt the circumplex model to find the location
(axis) of 'comfortability' and 'uncomfortability' on the circumplex model, and
its location match with the closest emotions on the circumplex model. Finally,
the study showed that the proposed approach can estimate human
comfortability/uncomfortability from physiological signals.

<p class="mathjax">Narrowband power line communication (NB-PLC) systems are an attractive
solution for supporting current and future smart grids. A technology proposed
to enhance data rate in NB-PLC is multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
transmission over multiple power line phases. To achieve reliable communication
over MIMO NB-PLC, a key challenge is to take into account and mitigate the
effects of temporally and spatially correlated cyclostationary noise. Noise
samples in a cycle can be divided into three classes with different
distributions, i.e. Gaussian, moderate impulsive, and strong impulsive.
However, in this paper we first show that the impulsive classes in their turn
can be divided into sub-classes with normal distributions and, after deriving
the theoretical capacity, two noise sample sets with such characteristics are
used to evaluate achievable information rates: one sample set is the measured
noise in laboratory and the other is produced through MIMO frequency-shift
(FRESH) filtering. The achievable information rates are attained by means of a
spatio-temporal whitening of the portions of the cyclostationary correlated
noise samples that belong to the Gaussian sub-classes. The proposed approach
can be useful to design the optimal receiver in terms of bit allocation using
waterfilling algorithm and to adapt modulation order.

<p class="mathjax">Directed acyclic graph (DAG) tasks are currently adopted in the real-time
domain to model complex applications from the automotive, avionics, and
industrial domain that implement their functionalities through chains of
intercommunicating tasks. This paper studies the problem of scheduling
real-time DAG tasks by presenting a novel schedulability test based on the
concept of trivial schedulability. Using this schedulability test, we propose a
new DAG scheduling framework (edge generation scheduling -- EGS) that attempts
to minimize the DAG width by iteratively generating edges while guaranteeing
the deadline constraint. We study how to efficiently solve the problem of
generating edges by developing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm combined
with a graph representation neural network to learn an efficient edge
generation policy for EGS. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm by comparing it with state-of-the-art DAG scheduling heuristics and
an optimal mixed-integer linear programming baseline. Experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by requiring fewer
processors to schedule the same DAG tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The composition theorems of differential privacy (DP) allow data curators to
combine different algorithms to obtain a new algorithm that continues to
satisfy DP. However, new granularity notions (i.e., neighborhood definitions),
data domains, and composition settings have appeared in the literature that the
classical composition theorems do not cover. For instance, the parallel
composition theorem does not apply to general granularity notions. This
complicates the opportunity of composing DP mechanisms in new settings and
obtaining accurate estimates of the incurred privacy loss after composition.
<br />To overcome these limitations, we study the composability of DP in a general
framework and for any kind of data domain or neighborhood definition. We give a
general composition theorem in both independent and adaptive versions and we
provide analogous composition results for approximate, zero-concentrated, and
Gaussian DP. Besides, we study the hypothesis needed to obtain the best
composition bounds. Our theorems cover both parallel and sequential composition
settings. Importantly, they also cover every setting in between, allowing us to
compute the final privacy loss of a composition with greatly improved accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">As technology progresses, industrial and scientific robots are increasingly
being used in diverse settings. In many cases, however, programming the robot
to perform such tasks is technically complex and costly. To maximize the
utility of robots in industrial and scientific settings, they require the
ability to quickly shift from one task to another. Reinforcement learning
algorithms provide the potential to enable robots to learn optimal solutions to
complete new tasks without directly reprogramming them. The current
state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning, however, generally relies on fast
simulations and parallelization to achieve optimal performance. These are often
not possible in robotics applications. Thus, a significant amount of research
is required to facilitate the efficient and safe, training and deployment of
industrial and scientific reinforcement learning robots. This technical report
outlines our initial research into the application of deep reinforcement
learning on an industrial UR10e robot. The report describes the reinforcement
learning environments created to facilitate policy learning with the UR10e, a
robotic arm from Universal Robots, and presents our initial results in training
deep Q-learning and proximal policy optimization agents on the developed
reinforcement learning environments. Our results show that proximal policy
optimization learns a better, more stable policy with less data than deep
Q-learning. The corresponding code for this work is available at

<p class="mathjax">Multiple intent detection and slot filling are two fundamental and crucial
tasks in spoken language understanding. Motivated by the fact that the two
tasks are closely related, joint models that can detect intents and extract
slots simultaneously are preferred to individual models that perform each task
independently. The accuracy of a joint model depends heavily on the ability of
the model to transfer information between the two tasks so that the result of
one task can correct the result of the other. In addition, since a joint model
has multiple outputs, how to train the model effectively is also challenging.
In this paper, we present a method for multiple intent detection and slot
filling by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a bidirectional joint
model that explicitly employs intent information to recognize slots and slot
features to detect intents. Second, we introduce a novel method for training
the proposed joint model using supervised contrastive learning and
self-distillation. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets MixATIS and
MixSNIPS show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both
tasks. The results also demonstrate the contributions of both bidirectional
design and the training method to the accuracy improvement. Our source code is

<p class="mathjax">Childhood and adolescent obesity rates are a global concern because obesity
is associated with chronic diseases and long-term health risks. Artificial
intelligence technology has emerged as a promising solution to accurately
predict obesity rates and provide personalized feedback to adolescents. This
study emphasizes the importance of early identification and prevention of
obesity-related health issues. Factors such as height, weight, waist
circumference, calorie intake, physical activity levels, and other relevant
health information need to be considered for developing robust algorithms for
obesity rate prediction and delivering personalized feedback. Hence, by
collecting health datasets from 321 adolescents, we proposed an adolescent
obesity prediction system that provides personalized predictions and assists
individuals in making informed health decisions. Our proposed deep learning
framework, DeepHealthNet, effectively trains the model using data augmentation
techniques, even when daily health data are limited, resulting in improved
prediction accuracy (acc: 0.8842). Additionally, the study revealed variations
in the prediction of the obesity rate between boys (acc: 0.9320) and girls
(acc: 0.9163), allowing the identification of disparities and the determination
of the optimal time to provide feedback. The proposed system shows significant
potential in effectively addressing childhood and adolescent obesity.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) is increasingly becoming the default approach for
training machine learning models across decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT)
devices. A key advantage of FL is that no raw data are communicated across the
network, providing an immediate layer of privacy. Despite this, recent works
have demonstrated that data reconstruction can be done with the locally trained
model updates which are communicated across the network. However, many of these
works have limitations with regard to how the gradients are computed in
backpropagation. In this work, we demonstrate that the model weights shared in
FL can expose revealing information about the local data distributions of IoT
devices. This leakage could expose sensitive information to malicious actors in
a distributed system. We further discuss results which show that injecting
noise into model weights is ineffective at preventing data leakage without
seriously harming the global model accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Following the success of Word2Vec embeddings, graph embeddings (GEs) have
gained substantial traction. GEs are commonly generated and evaluated
extrinsically on downstream applications, but intrinsic evaluations of the
original graph properties in terms of topological structure and semantic
information have been lacking. Understanding these will help identify the
deficiency of the various families of GE methods when vectorizing graphs in
terms of preserving the relevant knowledge or learning incorrect knowledge. To
address this, we propose RESTORE, a framework for intrinsic GEs assessment
through graph reconstruction. We show that reconstructing the original graph
from the underlying GEs yields insights into the relative amount of information
preserved in a given vector form. We first introduce the graph reconstruction
task. We generate GEs from three GE families based on factorization methods,
random walks, and deep learning (with representative algorithms from each
family) on the CommonSense Knowledge Graph (CSKG). We analyze their
effectiveness in preserving the (a) topological structure of node-level graph
reconstruction with an increasing number of hops and (b) semantic information
on various word semantic and analogy tests. Our evaluations show deep
learning-based GE algorithm (SDNE) is overall better at preserving (a) with a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.54 and 0.35 for 2 and 3-hop reconstruction
respectively, while the factorization-based algorithm (HOPE) is better at
encapsulating (b) with an average Euclidean distance of 0.14, 0.17, and 0.11
for 1, 2, and 3-hop reconstruction respectively. The modest performance of
these GEs leaves room for further research avenues on better graph
representation learning.

<p class="mathjax">Self-adaptation is a crucial feature of autonomous systems that must cope
with uncertainties in, e.g., their environment and their internal state.
Self-adaptive systems are often modelled as two-layered systems with a managed
subsystem handling the domain concerns and a managing subsystem implementing
the adaptation logic. We consider a case study of a self-adaptive robotic
system; more concretely, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) used for
pipeline inspection. In this paper, we model and analyse it with the
feature-aware probabilistic model checker ProFeat. The functionalities of the
AUV are modelled in a feature model, capturing the AUV's variability. This
allows us to model the managed subsystem of the AUV as a family of systems,
where each family member corresponds to a valid feature configuration of the
AUV. The managing subsystem of the AUV is modelled as a control layer capable
of dynamically switching between such valid feature configurations, depending
both on environmental and internal conditions. We use this model to analyse
probabilistic reward and safety properties for the AUV.

<p class="mathjax">6D pose estimation of textureless shiny objects has become an essential
problem in many robotic applications. Many pose estimators require high-quality
depth data, often measured by structured light cameras. However, when objects
have shiny surfaces (e.g., metal parts), these cameras fail to sense complete
depths from a single viewpoint due to the specular reflection, resulting in a
significant drop in the final pose accuracy. To mitigate this issue, we present
a complete active vision framework for 6D object pose refinement and
next-best-view prediction. Specifically, we first develop an optimization-based
pose refinement module for the structured light camera. Our system then selects
the next best camera viewpoint to collect depth measurements by minimizing the
predicted uncertainty of the object pose. Compared to previous approaches, we
additionally predict measurement uncertainties of future viewpoints by online
rendering, which significantly improves the next-best-view prediction
performance. We test our approach on the challenging real-world ROBI dataset.
The results demonstrate that our pose refinement method outperforms the
traditional ICP-based approach when given the same input depth data, and our
next-best-view strategy can achieve high object pose accuracy with
significantly fewer viewpoints than the heuristic-based policies.

<p class="mathjax">In many real-world settings, image observations of freely rotating 3D rigid
bodies, may be available when low-dimensional measurements are not. However,
the high-dimensionality of image data precludes the use of classical estimation
techniques to learn the dynamics. The usefulness of standard deep learning
methods is also limited because an image of a rigid body reveals nothing about
the distribution of mass inside the body, which, together with initial angular
velocity, is what determines how the body will rotate. We present a
physics-informed neural network model to estimate and predict 3D rotational
dynamics from image sequences. We achieve this using a multi-stage prediction
pipeline that maps individual images to a latent representation homeomorphic to
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$, computes angular velocities from latent pairs, and predicts
future latent states using the Hamiltonian equations of motion. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach on new rotating rigid-body datasets of sequences
of synthetic images of rotating objects, including cubes, prisms and
satellites, with unknown uniform and non-uniform mass distributions.

<p class="mathjax">BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Histological remission (HR) is advocated and considered as
a new therapeutic target in ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis of histologic
remission currently relies on biopsy; during this process, patients are at risk
for bleeding, infection, and post-biopsy fibrosis. In addition, histologic
response scoring is complex and time-consuming, and there is heterogeneity
among pathologists. Endocytoscopy (EC) is a novel ultra-high magnification
endoscopic technique that can provide excellent in vivo assessment of glands.
Based on the EC technique, we propose a neural network model that can assess
histological disease activity in UC using EC images to address the above
issues. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can assist
patients in precise treatment and prognostic assessment.
<br />METHODS: We construct a neural network model for UC evaluation. A total of
5105 images of 154 intestinal segments from 87 patients undergoing EC treatment
at a center in China between March 2022 and March 2023 are scored according to
the Geboes score. Subsequently, 103 intestinal segments are used as the
training set, 16 intestinal segments are used as the validation set for neural
network training, and the remaining 35 intestinal segments are used as the test
set to measure the model performance together with the validation set.
<br />RESULTS: By treating HR as a negative category and histologic activity as a
positive category, the proposed neural network model can achieve an accuracy of
0.9, a specificity of 0.95, a sensitivity of 0.75, and an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.81.
<br />CONCLUSION: We develop a specific neural network model that can distinguish
histologic remission/activity in EC images of UC, which helps to accelerate
clinical histological diagnosis.

<p class="mathjax">One of the main tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP), is Named Entity
Recognition (NER). It is used in many applications and also can be used as an
intermediate step for other tasks. We present ANER, a web-based named entity
recognizer for the Arabic, and Arabizi languages. The model is built upon BERT,
which is a transformer-based encoder. It can recognize 50 different entity
classes, covering various fields. We trained our model on the WikiFANE\_Gold
dataset which consists of Wikipedia articles. We achieved an F1 score of
88.7\%, which beats CAMeL Tools' F1 score of 83\% on the ANERcorp dataset,
which has only 4 classes. We also got an F1 score of 77.7\% on the
NewsFANE\_Gold dataset which contains out-of-domain data from News articles.
The system is deployed on a user-friendly web interface that accepts users'
inputs in Arabic, or Arabizi. It allows users to explore the entities in the
text by highlighting them. It can also direct users to get information about
entities through Wikipedia directly. We added the ability to do NER using our
model, or CAMeL Tools' model through our website. ANER is publicly accessible
at \url{<a href="http://www.aner.online">this http URL</a>}. We also deployed our model on HuggingFace at

<p class="mathjax">While it is generally acknowledged that force feedback is beneficial to
robotic control, applications of policy learning to robotic manipulation
typically only leverage visual feedback. Recently, symmetric neural models have
been used to significantly improve the sample efficiency and performance of
policy learning across a variety of robotic manipulation domains. This paper
explores an application of symmetric policy learning to visual-force problems.
We present Symmetric Visual Force Learning (SVFL), a novel method for robotic
control which leverages visual and force feedback. We demonstrate that SVFL can
significantly outperform state of the art baselines for visual force learning
and report several interesting empirical findings related to the utility of
learning force feedback control policies in both general manipulation tasks and
scenarios with low visual acuity.

<p class="mathjax">There is a growing interest in using pose estimation algorithms for
video-based assessment of Bradykinesia in Parkinson's Disease (PD) to
facilitate remote disease assessment and monitoring. However, the accuracy of
pose estimation algorithms in videos from video streaming services during
Telehealth appointments has not been studied. In this study, we used seven
off-the-shelf hand pose estimation models to estimate the movement of the thumb
and index fingers in videos of the finger-tapping (FT) test recorded from
Healthy Controls (HC) and participants with PD and under two different
conditions: streaming (videos recorded during a live Zoom meeting) and
on-device (videos recorded locally with high-quality cameras). The accuracy and
reliability of the models were estimated by comparing the models' output with
manual results. Three of the seven models demonstrated good accuracy for
on-device recordings, and the accuracy decreased significantly for streaming
recordings. We observed a negative correlation between movement speed and the
model's accuracy for the streaming recordings. Additionally, we evaluated the
reliability of ten movement features related to bradykinesia extracted from
video recordings of PD patients performing the FT test. While most of the
features demonstrated excellent reliability for on-device recordings, most of
the features demonstrated poor to moderate reliability for streaming
recordings. Our findings highlight the limitations of pose estimation
algorithms when applied to video recordings obtained during Telehealth visits,
and demonstrate that on-device recordings can be used for automatic
video-assessment of bradykinesia in PD.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting online sexual predatory behaviours and abusive language on social
media platforms has become a critical area of research due to the growing
concerns about online safety, especially for vulnerable populations such as
children and adolescents. Researchers have been exploring various techniques
and approaches to develop effective detection systems that can identify and
mitigate these risks. Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has
opened a new opportunity to address this problem more effectively. This paper
proposes an approach to detection of online sexual predatory chats and abusive
language using the open-source pretrained Llama 2 7B-parameter model, recently
released by Meta GenAI. We fine-tune the LLM using datasets with different
sizes, imbalance degrees, and languages (i.e., English, Roman Urdu and Urdu).
Based on the power of LLMs, our approach is generic and automated without a
manual search for a synergy between feature extraction and classifier design
steps like conventional methods in this domain. Experimental results show a
strong performance of the proposed approach, which performs proficiently and
consistently across three distinct datasets with five sets of experiments. This
study's outcomes indicate that the proposed method can be implemented in
real-world applications (even with non-English languages) for flagging sexual
predators, offensive or toxic content, hate speech, and discriminatory language
in online discussions and comments to maintain respectful internet or digital
communities. Furthermore, it can be employed for solving text classification
problems with other potential applications such as sentiment analysis, spam and
phishing detection, sorting legal documents, fake news detection, language
identification, user intent recognition, text-based product categorization,
medical record analysis, and resume screening.

<p class="mathjax">360$^\circ$ panoramas are extensively utilized as environmental light sources
in computer graphics. However, capturing a 360$^\circ$ $\times$ 180$^\circ$
panorama poses challenges due to the necessity of specialized and costly
equipment, and additional human resources. Prior studies develop various
learning-based generative methods to synthesize panoramas from a single Narrow
Field-of-View (NFoV) image, but they are limited in alterable input patterns,
generation quality, and controllability. To address these issues, we propose a
novel pipeline called PanoDiff, which efficiently generates complete
360$^\circ$ panoramas using one or more unregistered NFoV images captured from
arbitrary angles. Our approach has two primary components to overcome the
limitations. Firstly, a two-stage angle prediction module to handle various
numbers of NFoV inputs. Secondly, a novel latent diffusion-based panorama
generation model uses incomplete panorama and text prompts as control signals
and utilizes several geometric augmentation schemes to ensure geometric
properties in generated panoramas. Experiments show that PanoDiff achieves
state-of-the-art panoramic generation quality and high controllability, making
it suitable for applications such as content editing.

<p class="mathjax">Software developers often struggle to update APIs, leading to manual,
time-consuming, and error-prone processes. We introduce MELT, a new approach
that generates lightweight API migration rules directly from pull requests in
popular library repositories. Our key insight is that pull requests merged into
open-source libraries are a rich source of information sufficient to mine API
migration rules. By leveraging code examples mined from the library source and
automatically generated code examples based on the pull requests, we infer
transformation rules in \comby, a language for structural code search and
replace. Since inferred rules from single code examples may be too specific, we
propose a generalization procedure to make the rules more applicable to client
projects. MELT rules are syntax-driven, interpretable, and easily adaptable.
Moreover, unlike previous work, our approach enables rule inference to
seamlessly integrate into the library workflow, removing the need to wait for
client code migrations. We evaluated MELT on pull requests from four popular
libraries, successfully mining 461 migration rules from code examples in pull
requests and 114 rules from auto-generated code examples. Our generalization
procedure increases the number of matches for mined rules by 9x. We applied
these rules to client projects and ran their tests, which led to an overall
decrease in the number of warnings and fixing some test cases demonstrating
MELT's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Context: Potential employers can readily find job candidates' photos through
various online sources such as former employers' websites or professional and
social networks. The alignment or 'fit' between a candidate and an organization
is inferred in online photos through dress style and presentations of self. On
the other hand, for candidates from under-represented groups like Indigenous
people traditional clothing is an important and lively aspect that allows them
to express belonging, enter ceremony, and show resistance.Objective: This
exploratory study aims to empirically demonstrate whether traditional clothing
in a picture affects the evaluation of candidates' competence for a position
like a software developer in which clothing should not be crucial. Method: We
plan a quasi-experimental design with both candidates (photo models) and
participants (evaluators) from IT companies. It follows a 2 x 2 x 2 design with
dress style (traditional / non-traditional clothing), gender and race/ethnicity
of the candidates as within-subjects factors. In addition, we will explore the
evaluator's gender and experience in hiring as between-subjects factors.

<p class="mathjax">This study aimed to investigate the key technical and psychological factors
that impact the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
professionals' trust in collaborative robots (cobots) powered by artificial
intelligence (AI). The study employed a nationwide survey of 600 AEC industry
practitioners to gather in-depth responses and valuable insights into the
future opportunities for promoting the adoption, cultivation, and training of a
skilled workforce to leverage this technology effectively. A Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that safety and reliability are
significant factors for the adoption of AI-powered cobots in construction. Fear
of being replaced resulting from the use of cobots can have a substantial
effect on the mental health of the affected workers. A lower error rate in jobs
involving cobots, safety measurements, and security of data collected by cobots
from jobsites significantly impact reliability, while the transparency of
cobots' inner workings can benefit accuracy, robustness, security, privacy, and
communication, and results in higher levels of automation, all of which
demonstrated as contributors to trust. The study's findings provide critical
insights into the perceptions and experiences of AEC professionals towards
adoption of cobots in construction and help project teams determine the
adoption approach that aligns with the company's goals workers' welfare.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous repository of drone-enabled aerial
base stations with varying transmit powers that provide downlink wireless
coverage for ground users. One particular challenge is optimal selection and
deployment of a subset of available drone base stations (DBSs) to satisfy the
downlink data rate requirements while minimizing the overall power consumption.
In order to address this challenge, we formulate an optimization problem to
select the best subset of available DBSs so as to guarantee wireless coverage
with some acceptable transmission rate in the downlink path. In addition to the
selection of DBSs, we determine their 3D position so as to minimize their
overall power consumption. Moreover, assuming that the DBSs operate in the same
frequency band, we develop a novel and computationally efficient beamforming
method to alleviate the inter-cell interference impact on the downlink. We
propose a Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution to determine the optimal
beamforming strategy in the downlink path to compensate for the impairment
caused by the interference. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed solution and provide valuable insights into the performance of the
heterogeneous drone-based small cell networks.

<p class="mathjax">Existing approaches to unsupervised video instance segmentation typically
rely on motion estimates and experience difficulties tracking small or
divergent motions. We present VideoCutLER, a simple method for unsupervised
multi-instance video segmentation without using motion-based learning signals
like optical flow or training on natural videos. Our key insight is that using
high-quality pseudo masks and a simple video synthesis method for model
training is surprisingly sufficient to enable the resulting video model to
effectively segment and track multiple instances across video frames. We show
the first competitive unsupervised learning results on the challenging
YouTubeVIS-2019 benchmark, achieving 50.7% APvideo^50 , surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. VideoCutLER can also serve as a strong
pretrained model for supervised video instance segmentation tasks, exceeding
DINO by 15.9% on YouTubeVIS-2019 in terms of APvideo.

<p class="mathjax">Dense 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation are key challenges in
autonomous driving and robotics. Compared to the complex, multi-modal systems
deployed today, multi-camera systems provide a simpler, low-cost alternative.
However, camera-based 3D reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes has proven
extremely difficult, as existing solutions often produce incomplete or
incoherent results. We propose R3D3, a multi-camera system for dense 3D
reconstruction and ego-motion estimation. Our approach iterates between
geometric estimation that exploits spatial-temporal information from multiple
cameras, and monocular depth refinement. We integrate multi-camera feature
correlation and dense bundle adjustment operators that yield robust geometric
depth and pose estimates. To improve reconstruction where geometric depth is
unreliable, e.g. for moving objects or low-textured regions, we introduce
learnable scene priors via a depth refinement network. We show that this design
enables a dense, consistent 3D reconstruction of challenging, dynamic outdoor
environments. Consequently, we achieve state-of-the-art dense depth prediction
on the DDAD and NuScenes benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic patrol routing is known to be advantageous in adversarial
settings; however, the optimal choice of stochastic routing strategy is
dependent on a model of the adversary. Duan et al. formulated a Stackelberg
game for the worst-case scenario, i.e., a surveillance agent confronted with an
omniscient attacker [IEEE TCNS, 8(2), 769-80, 2021]. In this article, we extend
their formulation to accommodate heterogeneous defenses at the various nodes of
the graph. We derive an upper bound on the value of the game. We identify
methods for computing effective patrol strategies for certain classes of
graphs. Finally, we leverage the heterogeneous defense formulation to develop
novel defense placement algorithms that complement the patrol strategies.

<p class="mathjax">We study local filters for the Lipschitz property of real-valued functions
$f: V \to [0,r]$, where the Lipschitz property is defined with respect to an
arbitrary undirected graph $G=(V,E)$. We give nearly optimal local Lipschitz
filters both with respect to $\ell_1$ distance and $\ell_0$ distance. Previous
work only considered unbounded-range functions over $[n]^d$. Jha and
Raskhodnikova (SICOMP `13) gave an algorithm for such functions with lookup
complexity exponential in $d$, which Awasthi et al.\ (ACM Trans. Comput.
Theory) showed was necessary in this setting. By considering the natural class
of functions whose range is bounded in $[0,r]$, we circumvent this lower bound
and achieve running time $(d^r\log n)^{O(\log r)}$ for the $\ell_1$-respecting
filter and $d^{O(r)}\text{polylog }n$ for the $\ell_0$-respecting filter for
functions over $[n]^d$. Furthermore, we show that our algorithms are nearly
optimal in terms of the dependence on $r$ for the domain $\{0,1\}^d$, an
important special case of the domain $[n]^d$. In addition, our lower bound
resolves an open question of Awasthi et al., removing one of the conditions
necessary for their lower bound for general range. We prove our lower bound via
a reduction from distribution-free Lipschitz testing. Finally, we provide two
applications of our local filters. First, they can be used in conjunction with
the Laplace mechanism for differential privacy to provide filter mechanisms for
privately releasing outputs of black box functions even in the presence of
malicious clients. Second, we use them to obtain the first tolerant testers for
the Lipschitz property.

are often hierarchically structured, e.g., a company sales might be broken down
into different regions, and each region into different stores. In some cases
the number of series in the hierarchy is too big to fit in a single model to
produce forecasts in relevant time, and a decentralized approach is beneficial.
<br />One way to do this is to train independent forecasting models for each series
and for some summary statistics series implied by the hierarchy (e.g. the sum
of all series) and to pass those models to a reconciliation algorithm to
improve those forecasts by sharing information between the series.
<br />In this work we focus on the reconciliation step, and propose a method to do
so from a Bayesian perspective - Bayesian forecast reconciliation. We also
define the common case of linear Gaussian reconciliation, where the forecasts
are Gaussian and the hierarchy has linear structure, and show that we can
compute reconciliation in closed form. We evaluate these methods on synthetic
and real data sets, and compare them to other work in this field.

<p class="mathjax">The present paper addresses if and how an article's academic impact varies by
knowledge development approaches. Specifically, it classifies conceptual and
empirical articles published in four marketing journals - Journal of Marketing,
Journal of Marketing Research, Journal of Consumer Research, and Marketing
Science - with the aid of a large language model, GPT. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) test is implemented for each journal to compare the disruption scores of
conceptual and empirical articles. The results show that conceptual research is
more likely to disrupt the field of marketing while it tends to decline in its
publication quantity. Our paper highlights the importance of conceptual
articles and contributes to the understanding of how marketing articles are
developed and disseminated to advance knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">In panorama understanding, the widely used equirectangular projection (ERP)
entails boundary discontinuity and spatial distortion. It severely deteriorates
the conventional CNNs and vision Transformers on panoramas. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective architecture named PanoSwin to learn panorama
representations with ERP. To deal with the challenges brought by
equirectangular projection, we explore a pano-style shift windowing scheme and
novel pitch attention to address the boundary discontinuity and the spatial
distortion, respectively. Besides, based on spherical distance and Cartesian
coordinates, we adapt absolute positional embeddings and relative positional
biases for panoramas to enhance panoramic geometry information. Realizing that
planar image understanding might share some common knowledge with panorama
understanding, we devise a novel two-stage learning framework to facilitate
knowledge transfer from the planar images to panoramas. We conduct experiments
against the state-of-the-art on various panoramic tasks, i.e., panoramic object
detection, panoramic classification, and panoramic layout estimation. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoSwin in panorama
understanding.

<p class="mathjax">A code summary is a brief natural language description of source code.
Summaries are usually only a single sentence long, and yet form the backbone of
developer documentation. A short descriptions such as "changes all visible
polygons to the color blue" can give a programmer a high-level idea of what
code does without the effort of reading the code itself. Recently, products
based on Large Language Models such as ChatGPT have demonstrated a strong
ability to write these descriptions automatically. However, to use these tools,
programmers must send their code to untrusted third parties for processing
(e.g., via an API call). This loss of custody is not acceptable to many
organizations. In this paper, we present an alternative: we train an open
source model using sample output generated by GPT-3.5 in a process related to
knowledge distillation. Our model is small enough (350m parameters) to be run
on a single 16gb GPU, yet we show in our evaluation that it is large enough to
mimic GPT-3.5 on this task.

computer vision applications. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that
photorealistic novel view synthesis is within reach, but was gated by

Several recent approaches have built on alternative shape representations, in

integrating differentiable optical flow, exporting watertight meshes and
rendering per-ray normals. Additionally, we show how two of the recent methods

<p class="mathjax">Secure computation protocols combine inputs from involved parties to generate
an output while keeping their inputs private. Private Set Intersection (PSI) is
a secure computation protocol that allows two parties, who each hold a set of
items, to learn the intersection of their sets without revealing anything else
about the items. Private Intersection Sum (PIS) extends PSI when the two
parties want to learn the cardinality of the intersection, as well as the sum
of the associated integer values for each identifier in the intersection, but
nothing more. Finally, Private Join and Compute (PJC) is a scalable extension
of PIS protocol to help organizations work together with confidential data
sets. The extensions proposed in this paper include: (a) extending PJC protocol
to additional data columns and applying columnar aggregation based on supported
homomorphic operations, (b) exploring Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE)
homomorphic encryption schemes to apply arithmetic operations such as sum and
sum of squares, (c) ensuring stronger security using mutual authentication of
communicating parties using certificates, and (d) developing a Website to
operationalize such a service offering. We applied our results to develop a
Proof-of-Concept solution called JingBing, a voter list validation service that
allows different states to register, acquire secure communication modules,
install it, and then conduct authenticated peer-to-peer communication. We
conclude our paper with directions for future research to make such a solution
scalable for practical real-life scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that
considers both text and image queries together, to search for relevant images
in a database. Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets,
comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification
from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR
triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead
propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates
triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task
to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos
with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language
model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this
methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct
our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we
introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set,
along with baseline results. Our experiments further demonstrate that training
a CoVR model on our dataset effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved
state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on both the CIRR and
FashionIQ benchmarks. Our code, datasets, and models are publicly available at
https://imagine.enpc.fr/~ventural/covr.

<p class="mathjax">This report presents MagicAvatar, a framework for multimodal video generation
and animation of human avatars. Unlike most existing methods that generate
avatar-centric videos directly from multimodal inputs (e.g., text prompts),
MagicAvatar explicitly disentangles avatar video generation into two stages:
(1) multimodal-to-motion and (2) motion-to-video generation. The first stage
translates the multimodal inputs into motion/ control signals (e.g., human
pose, depth, DensePose); while the second stage generates avatar-centric video
guided by these motion signals. Additionally, MagicAvatar supports avatar
animation by simply providing a few images of the target person. This
capability enables the animation of the provided human identity according to
the specific motion derived from the first stage. We demonstrate the
flexibility of MagicAvatar through various applications, including text-guided
and video-guided avatar generation, as well as multimodal avatar animation.

<p class="mathjax">In this report, we present MagicEdit, a surprisingly simple yet effective
solution to the text-guided video editing task. We found that high-fidelity and
temporally coherent video-to-video translation can be achieved by explicitly
disentangling the learning of content, structure and motion signals during
training. This is in contradict to most existing methods which attempt to
jointly model both the appearance and temporal representation within a single
framework, which we argue, would lead to degradation in per-frame quality.
Despite its simplicity, we show that MagicEdit supports various downstream
video editing tasks, including video stylization, local editing, video-MagicMix
and video outpainting.

<p class="mathjax">This paper argues that a range of current AI systems have learned how to
deceive humans. We define deception as the systematic inducement of false
beliefs in the pursuit of some outcome other than the truth. We first survey
empirical examples of AI deception, discussing both special-use AI systems
(including Meta's CICERO) built for specific competitive situations, and
general-purpose AI systems (such as large language models). Next, we detail
several risks from AI deception, such as fraud, election tampering, and losing
control of AI systems. Finally, we outline several potential solutions to the
problems posed by AI deception: first, regulatory frameworks should subject AI
systems that are capable of deception to robust risk-assessment requirements;
second, policymakers should implement bot-or-not laws; and finally,
policymakers should prioritize the funding of relevant research, including
tools to detect AI deception and to make AI systems less deceptive.
Policymakers, researchers, and the broader public should work proactively to
prevent AI deception from destabilizing the shared foundations of our society.

<p class="mathjax">Visual similarities discovery (VSD) is an important task with broad
e-commerce applications. Given an image of a certain object, the goal of VSD is
to retrieve images of different objects with high perceptual visual similarity.
Although being a highly addressed problem, the evaluation of proposed methods
for VSD is often based on a proxy of an identification-retrieval task,
evaluating the ability of a model to retrieve different images of the same
object. We posit that evaluating VSD methods based on identification tasks is
limited, and faithful evaluation must rely on expert annotations. In this
paper, we introduce the first large-scale fashion visual similarity benchmark
dataset, consisting of more than 110K expert-annotated image pairs. Besides
this major contribution, we share insight from the challenges we faced while
curating this dataset. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and
efficient labeling procedure that can be applied to any dataset. Our analysis
examines its limitations and inductive biases, and based on these findings, we
propose metrics to mitigate those limitations. Though our primary focus lies on
visual similarity, the methodologies we present have broader applications for
discovering and evaluating perceptual similarity across various domains.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a theory for how geometric image transformations can be
handled by a first layer of linear receptive fields, in terms of true
covariance properties, which, in turn, enable geometric invariance properties
at higher levels in the visual hierarchy. Specifically, we develop this theory
for a generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields, which
is derived in an axiomatic manner from first principles, that reflect symmetry
properties of the environment, complemented by structural assumptions to
guarantee internally consistent treatment of image structures over multiple
spatio-temporal scales.
<br />It is shown how the studied generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual
receptive fields obeys true covariance properties under spatial scaling
transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and
temporal scaling transformations, implying that a vision system, based on image
and video measurements in terms of the receptive fields according to this
model, can to first order of approximation handle the image and video
deformations between multiple views of objects delimited by smooth surfaces, as
well as between multiple views of spatio-temporal events, under varying
relative motions between the objects and events in the world and the observer.
<br />We conclude by describing implications of the presented theory for biological
vision, regarding connections between the variabilities of the shapes of
biological visual receptive fields and the variabilities of spatial and
spatio-temporal image structures under natural image transformations.

<p class="mathjax">This study delves into the intricacies of emotional contagion and its impact
on performance within dyadic interactions. Specifically, it focuses on the
context of stereotype-based stress (SBS) during collaborative problem-solving
tasks among female pairs. Through an exploration of emotional contagion, the
research seeks to unveil its underlying mechanisms and effects. Leveraging
EEG-based hyperscanning technology, the study introduces an innovative approach
known as functional Graph Contrastive Learning (fGCL), which extracts
subject-invariant representations of neural activity patterns. These
representations are further subjected to analysis using the Dynamic Graph
Classification (DGC) model, aimed at dissecting the process of emotional
contagion. By scrutinizing brain synchronization and connectivity, the study
reveals the intricate interplay between emotional contagion and cognitive
functioning. The results underscore the substantial role of emotional contagion
in shaping the trajectories of participants' performance during collaborative
tasks in the presence of SBS conditions. Overall, this research contributes
invaluable insights into the neural underpinnings of emotional contagion,
thereby enriching our comprehension of the complexities underlying social
interactions and emotional dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new class of algorithms, Stochastic Generalized Method of
Moments (SGMM), for estimation and inference on (overidentified) moment
restriction models. Our SGMM is a novel stochastic approximation alternative to
the popular Hansen (1982) (offline) GMM, and offers fast and scalable
implementation with the ability to handle streaming datasets in real time. We
establish the almost sure convergence, and the (functional) central limit
theorem for the inefficient online 2SLS and the efficient SGMM. Moreover, we
propose online versions of the Durbin-Wu-Hausman and Sargan-Hansen tests that
can be seamlessly integrated within the SGMM framework. Extensive Monte Carlo
simulations show that as the sample size increases, the SGMM matches the
standard (offline) GMM in terms of estimation accuracy and gains over
computational efficiency, indicating its practical value for both large-scale
and online datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by a proof of
concept using two well known empirical examples with large sample sizes.

<p class="mathjax">The high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) calls for accessible
and cost-effective continuous cardiac monitoring tools. Despite
Electrocardiography (ECG) being the gold standard, continuous monitoring
remains a challenge, leading to the exploration of Photoplethysmography (PPG),
a promising but more basic alternative available in consumer wearables. This
notion has recently spurred interest in translating PPG to ECG signals. In this
work, we introduce Region-Disentangled Diffusion Model (RDDM), a novel
diffusion model designed to capture the complex temporal dynamics of ECG.
Traditional Diffusion models like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
(DDPM) face challenges in capturing such nuances due to the indiscriminate
noise addition process across the entire signal. Our proposed RDDM overcomes
such limitations by incorporating a novel forward process that selectively adds
noise to specific regions of interest (ROI) such as QRS complex in ECG signals,
and a reverse process that disentangles the denoising of ROI and non-ROI
regions. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that RDDM can generate
high-fidelity ECG from PPG in as few as 10 diffusion steps, making it highly
effective and computationally efficient. Additionally, to rigorously validate
the usefulness of the generated ECG signals, we introduce CardioBench, a
comprehensive evaluation benchmark for a variety of cardiac-related tasks
including heart rate and blood pressure estimation, stress classification, and
the detection of atrial fibrillation and diabetes. Our thorough experiments
show that RDDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on CardioBench. To the
best of our knowledge, RDDM is the first diffusion model for cross-modal
signal-to-signal translation in the bio-signal domain.

<p class="mathjax">Low-cost sensors (LCS) are affordable, compact, and often portable devices
designed to measure various environmental parameters, including air quality.
These sensors are intended to provide accessible and cost-effective solutions
for monitoring pollution levels in different settings, such as indoor, outdoor
and moving vehicles. However, the data produced by LCS is prone to various
sources of error that can affect accuracy. Calibration is a well-known
procedure to improve the reliability of the data produced by LCS, and several
developments and efforts have been made to calibrate the LCS. This work
proposes a novel Estimated Error Augmented Two-phase Calibration
(\textit{EEATC}) approach to calibrate the LCS in stationary and mobile
deployments. In contrast to the existing approaches, the \textit{EEATC}
calibrates the LCS in two phases, where the error estimated in the first phase
calibration is augmented with the input to the second phase, which helps the
second phase to learn the distributional features better to produce more
accurate results. We show that the \textit{EEATC} outperforms well-known
single-phase calibration models such as linear regression models (single
variable linear regression (SLR) and multiple variable linear regression (MLR))
and Random forest (RF) in stationary and mobile deployments. To test the
\textit{EEATC} in stationary deployments, we have used the Community Air Sensor
Network (CAIRSENSE) data set approved by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA), and the mobile deployments are tested with the
real-time data obtained from SensurAir, an LCS device developed and deployed on
moving vehicle in Chennai, India.

<p class="mathjax">To comprehensively assess optical fiber communication system conditions, it
is essential to implement joint estimation of the following four critical
impairments: nonlinear signal-to-noise ratio (SNRNL), optical signal-to-noise
ratio (OSNR), chromatic dispersion (CD) and differential group delay (DGD).
However, current studies only achieve identifying a limited number of
impairments within a narrow range, due to limitations in network capabilities
and lack of unified representation of impairments. To address these challenges,
we adopt time-frequency signal processing based on fractional Fourier transform
(FrFT) to achieve the unified representation of impairments, while employing a
Transformer based neural networks (NN) to break through network performance
limitations. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method, the
numerical simulation is carried on a 5-channel
polarization-division-multiplexed quadrature phase shift keying (PDM-QPSK) long
haul optical transmission system with the symbol rate of 50 GBaud per channel,
the mean absolute error (MAE) for SNRNL, OSNR, CD, and DGD estimation is 0.091
dB, 0.058 dB, 117 ps/nm, and 0.38 ps, and the monitoring window ranges from
0~20 dB, 10~30 dB, 0~51000 ps/nm, and 0~100 ps, respectively. Our proposed
method achieves accurate estimation of linear and nonlinear impairments over a
broad range, representing a significant advancement in the field of optical
performance monitoring (OPM).

detecting thyroid cancer, where advancements have been made using machine
learning (ML) and big data analytics to evaluate thyroid cancer prognosis and
determine a patient's risk of malignancy. This review paper summarizes a large
collection of articles related to artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques
used in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Accordingly, a new classification was
introduced to classify these techniques based on the AI algorithms used, the
purpose of the framework, and the computing platforms used. Additionally, this
study compares existing thyroid cancer datasets based on their features. The
focus of this study is on how AI-based tools can support the diagnosis and
treatment of thyroid cancer, through supervised, unsupervised, or hybrid
techniques. It also highlights the progress made and the unresolved challenges
in this field. Finally, the future trends and areas of focus in this field are

<p class="mathjax">We propose a variational inference (VI)-based channel state information (CSI)
estimation approach in a fully-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-aided mmWave single-user single-input multiple-output (SIMO)
communication system. Specifically, we first propose a VI-based joint channel
estimation method to estimate the user-equipment (UE) to RIS (UE-RIS) and RIS
to base station (RIS-BS) channels using uplink training signals in a passive
RIS setup. However, updating the phase-shifts based on the instantaneous CSI
(I-CSI) leads to a high signaling overhead especially due to the short
coherence block of the UE-RIS channel. Therefore, to reduce the signaling
complexity, we propose a VI-based method to estimate the RIS-BS channel along
with the covariance matrix of the UE-RIS channel that remains quasi-static for
a longer period than the instantaneous UE-RIS channel. In the VI framework, we
approximate the posterior of the channel gains/covariance matrix with
convenient distributions given the received uplink training signals. Then, the
learned distributions, which are close to the true posterior distributions in
terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, are leveraged to obtain the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimation of the considered CSI. The simulation results
demonstrate that MAP channel estimation using approximated posteriors yields a
capacity that is close to the one achieved with true posteriors, thus
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Furthermore, our
results show that estimating the channel covariance matrix improves the
spectral efficiency by reducing the pilot signaling required to obtain the
phase-shifts for the RIS elements in a channel-varying environment.

<p class="mathjax">Neurons in early sensory areas rapidly adapt to changing sensory statistics,
both by normalizing the variance of their individual responses and by reducing
correlations between their responses. Together, these transformations may be
viewed as an adaptive form of statistical whitening. Existing mechanistic
models of adaptive whitening exclusively use either synaptic plasticity or gain
modulation as the biological substrate for adaptation; however, on their own,
each of these models has significant limitations. In this work, we unify these
approaches in a normative multi-timescale mechanistic model that adaptively
whitens its responses with complementary computational roles for synaptic
plasticity and gain modulation. Gains are modified on a fast timescale to adapt
to the current statistical context, whereas synapses are modified on a slow
timescale to learn structural properties of the input statistics that are
invariant across contexts. Our model is derived from a novel multi-timescale
whitening objective that factorizes the inverse whitening matrix into basis
vectors, which correspond to synaptic weights, and a diagonal matrix, which
corresponds to neuronal gains. We test our model on synthetic and natural
datasets and find that the synapses learn optimal configurations over long
timescales that enable the circuit to adaptively whiten neural responses on
short timescales exclusively using gain modulation.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled a comprehensive
exploration of materials for various applications. However, AI models often
prioritize frequently encountered materials in the scientific literature,
limiting the selection of suitable candidates based on inherent physical and
chemical properties. To address this imbalance, we have generated a dataset of
1,494,017 natural language-material paragraphs based on combined OQMD,
Materials Project, JARVIS, COD and AFLOW2 databases, which are dominated by ab
initio calculations and tend to be much more evenly distributed on the periodic
table. The generated text narratives were then polled and scored by both human
experts and ChatGPT-4, based on three rubrics: technical accuracy, language and
structure, and relevance and depth of content, showing similar scores but with
human-scored depth of content being the most lagging. The merger of
multi-modality data sources and large language model (LLM) holds immense
potential for AI frameworks to help the exploration and discovery of
solid-state materials for specific applications.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum networks are important for quantum communication and consist of
entangled states that are essential for many tasks such as quantum
teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing and quantum error
correction. Graph states are a specific class of multipartite entangled states
that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing
graph states across a quantum network. We show that the distribution of graph
states can be characterised by a system of subgraph complementations, which we
also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree of
entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyse
resource usage for our algorithm and show it to match or be improved in the
number of qubits, bits for classical communication and EPR pairs utilised, as
compared to prior work. The number of local operations is efficient, and the
resource consumption for our approach scales linearly in the number of
vertices. This presents a quadratic improvement in completion time for several
classes of graph states represented by dense graphs, and implies a potential
for improved fidelity in the presence of noise. Common classes of graph states
are classified along with the optimal time for their distribution using
subgraph complementations. We also provide a framework to similarly find the
optimal sequence of operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state, and
prove upper bounds along with providing approximate greedy algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In this two-part article, we evaluate the utility and the generalizability of
the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithm for data-driven analysis and
reduced-order modelling of plasma dynamics in cross-field ExB configurations.
The DMD algorithm is an interpretable data-driven method that finds a best-fit
linear model describing the time evolution of spatiotemporally coherent
structures (patterns) in data. We have applied the DMD to extensive
high-fidelity datasets generated using a particle-in-cell (PIC) code based on a
cost-efficient reduced-order PIC scheme. In this part, we first provide an
overview of the concept of DMD and its underpinning Proper Orthogonal and
Singular Value Decomposition methods. Two of the main DMD variants are next
introduced. We then present and discuss the results of the DMD application in
terms of the identification and extraction of the dominant spatiotemporal modes
from high-fidelity data over a range of simulation conditions. We demonstrate
that the DMD variant based on variable projection optimization (OPT-DMD)
outperforms the basic DMD method in identification of the modes underlying the
data, leading to notably more reliable reconstruction of the ground-truth.
Furthermore, we show in multiple test cases that the discrete frequency
spectrum of OPT-DMD-extracted modes is consistent with the temporal spectrum
from the Fast Fourier Transform of the data. This observation implies that the
OPT-DMD augments the conventional spectral analyses by being able to uniquely
reveal the spatial structure of the dominant modes in the frequency spectra,
thus, yielding more accessible, comprehensive information on the spatiotemporal
characteristics of the plasma phenomena.

<p class="mathjax">In part I of the article, we demonstrated that a variant of the Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) algorithm based on variable projection optimization, called
Optimized DMD (OPT-DMD), enables a robust identification of the dominant
spatiotemporally coherent modes underlying the data across various test cases
representing different physical parameters in an ExB simulation configuration.
As the OPT-DMD can be constrained to produce stable reduced-order models (ROMs)
by construction, in this paper, we extend the application of the OPT-DMD and
investigate the capabilities of the linear ROM from this algorithm toward
forecasting in time of the plasma dynamics in configurations representative of
the radial-azimuthal and axial-azimuthal cross-sections of a Hall thruster and
over a range of simulation parameters in each test case. The predictive
capacity of the OPT-DMD ROM is assessed primarily in terms of short-term
dynamics forecast or, in other words, for large ratios of training-to-test
data. However, the utility of the ROM for long-term dynamics forecasting is
also presented for an example case in the radial-azimuthal configuration. The
model's predictive performance is heterogeneous across various test cases.
Nonetheless, a remarkable predictiveness is observed in the test cases that do
not exhibit highly transient behaviors. Moreover, in all investigated cases,
the error between the ground-truth and the reconstructed data from the OPT-DMD
ROM remains bounded over time within both the training and the test window. As
a result, despite its limitation in terms of generalized applicability to all
plasma conditions, the OPT-DMD is proven as a reliable method to develop low
computational cost and highly predictive data-driven reduced-order models in
systems with a quasi-periodic global evolution of the plasma state.

<p class="mathjax">Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are popular likelihood-based generative
models which can be efficiently trained by maximizing an Evidence Lower Bound
(ELBO). There has been much progress in improving the expressiveness of the
variational distribution to obtain tighter variational bounds and increased
generative performance. Whilst previous work has leveraged Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods for the construction of variational densities,
gradient-based methods for adapting the proposal distributions for deep latent
variable models have received less attention. This work suggests an
entropy-based adaptation for a short-run Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) or
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) chain while optimising a tighter variational
bound to the log-evidence. Experiments show that this approach yields higher
held-out log-likelihoods as well as improved generative metrics. Our implicit
variational density can adapt to complicated posterior geometries of latent
hierarchical representations arising in hierarchical VAEs.

motivations for this combination which are fulfilling the desire of analytical
philosophy, proposing science of philosophy, justifying mathematical algorithms

various examples for philomatics and psychomatics, some of which are explained
in more depth. The first example is the analysis of relation between the
context principle, semantic holism, and the usage theory of meaning with the
attention mechanism in mathematics. The other example is on the relations of
Plato's theory of forms in philosophy with the holographic principle in string
theory, object-oriented programming, and machine learning. Finally, the
relation between Wittgenstein's family resemblance and clustering in
mathematics is explained. This paper opens the door of research for combining

<p class="mathjax">Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising tool for reducing sampling costs.
Current deep neural network (NN)-based CS methods face challenges in collecting
labeled measurement-ground truth (GT) data and generalizing to real
applications. This paper proposes a novel $\mathbf{S}$elf-supervised
s$\mathbf{C}$alable deep CS method, comprising a $\mathbf{L}$earning scheme
called $\mathbf{SCL}$ and a family of $\mathbf{Net}$works named
$\mathbf{SCNet}$, which does not require GT and can handle arbitrary sampling
ratios and matrices once trained on a partial measurement set. Our SCL contains
a dual-domain loss and a four-stage recovery strategy. The former encourages a
cross-consistency on two measurement parts and a sampling-reconstruction
cycle-consistency regarding arbitrary ratios and matrices to maximize
data/information utilization. The latter can progressively leverage common
signal prior in external measurements and internal characteristics of test
samples and learned NNs to improve accuracy. SCNet combines the explicit
guidance from optimization algorithms with implicit regularization from
advanced NN blocks to learn a collaborative signal representation. Our
theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data,
covering 1-/2-/3-D natural and scientific signals, demonstrate the
effectiveness, superior performance, flexibility, and generalization ability of
our method over existing self-supervised methods and its significant potential
in competing against state-of-the-art supervised methods.

<p class="mathjax">Ultrasound (US) image segmentation is an active research area that requires
real-time and highly accurate analysis in many scenarios. The detect-to-segment
(DTS) frameworks have been recently proposed to balance accuracy and
efficiency. However, existing approaches may suffer from inadequate contour
encoding or fail to effectively leverage the encoded results. In this paper, we
introduce a novel Fourier-anchor-based DTS framework called Fourier Feature
Pyramid Network (FFPN) to address the aforementioned issues. The contributions
of this paper are two fold. First, the FFPN utilizes Fourier Descriptors to
adequately encode contours. Specifically, it maps Fourier series with similar
amplitudes and frequencies into the same layer of the feature map, thereby
effectively utilizing the encoded Fourier information. Second, we propose a
Contour Sampling Refinement (CSR) module based on the contour proposals and
refined features produced by the FFPN. This module extracts rich features
around the predicted contours to further capture detailed information and
refine the contours. Extensive experimental results on three large and
challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other DTS methods
in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, our framework can generalize
well to other detection or segmentation tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Optical packet header recognition is an important signal processing task of
optical communication networks. In this work, we propose an all-optical
reservoir, consisting of integrated double-ring resonators (DRRs) as nodes, for
fast and accurate optical packet header recognition. As the delay-bandwidth
product (DBP) of the node is a key figure-of-merit in the reservoir, we adopt a
deep reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the DBPs for various types of
DRRs, which has the advantage of full parameter space optimization and fast
convergence speed. Intriguingly, the optimized DBPs of the DRRs in cascaded,
parallel, and embedded configurations reach the same maximum value, which is
believed to be the global maximum. Finally, 3-bit and 6-bit packet header
recognition tasks are performed with the all-optical reservoir consisting of
the optimized cascaded rings, which have greatly reduced chip size and the
desired "flat-top" delay spectra. Using this optical computing scheme,
word-error rates as low as 5*10-4 and 9*10-4 are achieved for 3-bit and 6-bit
packet header recognition tasks, respectively, which are one order of magnitude
better than the previously reported values.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by real-world applications such as rental and cloud computing
services, we investigate pricing for reusable resources. We consider a system
where a single resource with a fixed number of identical copies serves
customers with heterogeneous willingness-to-pay (WTP), and the usage duration
distribution is general. Optimal dynamic policies are computationally
intractable when usage durations are not memoryless, so existing literature has
focused on static pricing, whose steady-state reward rate converges to
optimality at rate $\mathcal{O}(c^{-1/2})$ when supply and demand scale with
$c$. We show, however, that this convergence rate is suboptimal, and propose a
class of dynamic "stock-dependent" policies that 1) preserves computational
tractability and 2) has a steady-state reward rate converging to optimality
faster than $c^{-1/2}$. We characterize the tight convergence rate for
stock-dependent policies and show that they can in fact be achieved by a simple
two-price policy, that sets a higher price when the stock is below some
threshold and a lower price otherwise. Finally, we demonstrate this "minimally
dynamic" class of two-price policies to perform well numerically, even in
non-asymptotic settings, suggesting that a little dynamicity can go a long way.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised anomaly detection methods offer a promising and flexible
alternative to supervised approaches, holding the potential to revolutionize
medical scan analysis and enhance diagnostic performance.
<br />In the current landscape, it is commonly assumed that differences between a
test case and the training distribution are attributed solely to pathological
conditions, implying that any disparity indicates an anomaly. However, the
presence of other potential sources of distributional shift, including scanner,
age, sex, or race, is frequently overlooked. These shifts can significantly
impact the accuracy of the anomaly detection task. Prominent instances of such
failures have sparked concerns regarding the bias, credibility, and fairness of
anomaly detection.
<br />This work presents a novel analysis of biases in unsupervised anomaly
detection. By examining potential non-pathological distributional shifts
between the training and testing distributions, we shed light on the extent of
these biases and their influence on anomaly detection results. Moreover, this
study examines the algorithmic limitations that arise due to biases, providing
valuable insights into the challenges encountered by anomaly detection
algorithms in accurately learning and capturing the entire range of variability
present in the normative distribution. Through this analysis, we aim to enhance
the understanding of these biases and pave the way for future improvements in
the field. Here, we specifically investigate Alzheimer's disease detection from
brain MR imaging as a case study, revealing significant biases related to sex,
race, and scanner variations that substantially impact the results. These
findings align with the broader goal of improving the reliability, fairness,
and effectiveness of anomaly detection in medical imaging.

<p class="mathjax">Representational straightening refers to a decrease in curvature of visual
feature representations of a sequence of frames taken from natural movies.
Prior work established straightening in neural representations of the primate
primary visual cortex (V1) and perceptual straightening in human behavior as a
hallmark of biological vision in contrast to artificial feedforward neural
networks which did not demonstrate this phenomenon as they were not explicitly
optimized to produce temporally predictable movie representations. Here, we
show robustness to noise in the input image can produce representational
straightening in feedforward neural networks. Both adversarial training (AT)
and base classifiers for Random Smoothing (RS) induced remarkably straightened
feature codes. Demonstrating their utility within the domain of natural movies,
these codes could be inverted to generate intervening movie frames by linear
interpolation in the feature space even though they were not trained on these
trajectories. Demonstrating their biological utility, we found that AT and RS
training improved predictions of neural data in primate V1 over baseline models
providing a parsimonious, bio-plausible mechanism -- noise in the sensory input
stages -- for generating representations in early visual cortex. Finally, we
compared the geometric properties of frame representations in these networks to
better understand how they produced representations that mimicked the
straightening phenomenon from biology. Overall, this work elucidating emergent
properties of robust neural networks demonstrates that it is not necessary to
utilize predictive objectives or train directly on natural movie statistics to
achieve models supporting straightened movie representations similar to human
perception that also predict V1 neural responses.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation of brain tumours is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis that can help clinicians in diagnosing the patient and tracking the
progression of any malignant entities. Accurate segmentation of brain lesions
is essential for medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, failure to
acquire specific MRI imaging modalities can prevent applications from operating
in critical situations, raising concerns about their reliability and overall
trustworthiness. This paper presents a novel multi-modal approach for brain
lesion segmentation that leverages information from four distinct imaging
modalities while being robust to real-world scenarios of missing modalities,
such as T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR MRI of brains. Our proposed method can help
address the challenges posed by artifacts in medical imagery due to data
acquisition errors (such as patient motion) or a reconstruction algorithm's
inability to represent the anatomy while ensuring a trade-off in accuracy. Our
proposed regularization module makes it robust to these scenarios and ensures
the reliability of lesion segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">As drones become increasingly prevalent in human life, they also raises
security concerns such as unauthorized access and control, as well as
collisions and interference with manned aircraft. Therefore, ensuring the
ability to accurately detect and identify between different drones holds
significant implications for coverage extension. Assisted by machine learning,
radio frequency (RF) detection can recognize the type and flight mode of drones
based on the sampled drone signals. In this paper, we first utilize Short-Time
Fourier. Transform (STFT) to extract two-dimensional features from the raw
signals, which contain both time-domain and frequency-domain information. Then,
we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with ResNet structure to
achieve multi-class classifications. Our experimental results show that the
proposed ResNet-STFT can achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence on the
extended dataset. Additionally, it exhibits balanced performance compared to
other baselines on the raw dataset.

<p class="mathjax">We present a new transport-based approach to efficiently perform sequential
Bayesian inference of static model parameters. The strategy is based on the
extraction of conditional distribution from the joint distribution of
parameters and data, via the estimation of structured (e.g., block triangular)
transport maps. This gives explicit surrogate models for the likelihood
functions and their gradients. This allow gradient-based characterizations of
posterior density via transport maps in a model-free, online phase. This
framework is well suited for parameter estimation in case of complex noise
models including nuisance parameters and when the forward model is only known
as a black box. The numerical application of this method is performed in the
context of characterization of ice thickness with conductivity measurements.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a new approach for robust reading of identification
and sensor data from chipless RFID sensor tags. For the first time, Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) regression modelling techniques are
applied to a dataset of measured Radar Cross Section (RCS) data that has been
derived from large-scale robotic measurements of custom-designed, 3-bit
chipless RFID sensor tags. The robotic system is implemented using the
first-of-its-kind automated data acquisition method using an ur16e
industry-standard robot. A large data set of 9,600 Electromagnetic (EM) RCS
signatures collected using the automated system is used to train and validate
four ML models and four 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
architectures. For the first time, we report an end-to-end design and
implementation methodology for robust detection of identification (ID) and
sensing data using ML/DL models. Also, we report, for the first time, the
effect of varying tag surface shapes, tilt angles, and read ranges that were
incorporated into the training of models for robust detection of ID and sensing
values. The results show that all the models were able to generalise well on
the given data. However, the 1D CNN models outperformed the conventional ML
models in the detection of ID and sensing values. The best 1D CNN model
architectures performed well with a low Root Mean Square Error (RSME) of 0.061
(0.87%) for tag ID and 0.0241 (3.44%) error for the capacitive sensing.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in numerical simulation methods based on physical models
have enhanced the accuracy of weather forecasts. However, the precision
diminishes in complex terrains like mountainous regions due to the several
kilometers square grid used in numerical simulations. While statistical machine
learning has also significantly advanced, its direct application is difficult
to utilize physics knowledge. This paper proposes a method that employs machine
learning to ``interpolate'' future weather in mountainous regions using current
observed data and forecast data from surrounding plains. Generally, weather
prediction relies on numerical simulations, so this approach can be considered
a hybrid method that indirectly merges numerical simulation and machine
learning. The use of binary cross-entropy in precipitation prediction is also
examined.

<p class="mathjax">The most common type of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), has been
increasingly detected since the advent of low-dose computed tomography
screening technology. In clinical practice, pre-invasive LUAD (Pre-IAs) should
only require regular follow-up care, while invasive LUAD (IAs) should receive
immediate treatment with appropriate lung cancer resection, based on the cancer
subtype. However, prior research on diagnosing LUAD has mainly focused on
classifying Pre-IAs/IAs, as techniques for distinguishing different subtypes of
IAs have been lacking. In this study, we proposed a multi-head attentional
feature fusion (MHA-FF) model for not only distinguishing IAs from Pre-IAs, but
also for distinguishing the different subtypes of IAs. To predict the subtype
of each nodule accurately, we leveraged both radiomics and deep features
extracted from computed tomography images. Furthermore, those features were
aggregated through an adaptive fusion module that can learn attention-based
discriminative features. The utility of our proposed method is demonstrated
here by means of real-world data collected from a multi-center cohort.

<p class="mathjax">Lung cancer, particularly in its advanced stages, remains a leading cause of
death globally. Though early detection via low-dose computed tomography (CT) is
promising, the identification of high-risk factors crucial for surgical mode
selection remains a challenge. Addressing this, our study introduces an
Attention-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (AE-GCN) model to classify
whether there are high-risk factors in stage I lung cancer based on the
preoperative CT images. This will aid surgeons in determining the optimal
surgical method before the operation. Unlike previous studies that relied on 3D
patch techniques to represent nodule spatial features, our method employs a GCN
model to capture the spatial characteristics of pulmonary nodules.
Specifically, we regard each slice of the nodule as a graph vertex, and the
inherent spatial relationships between slices form the edges. Then, to enhance
the expression of nodule features, we integrated both channel and spatial
attention mechanisms with a pre-trained VGG model for adaptive feature
extraction from pulmonary nodules. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated using real-world data collected from the hospitals,
thereby emphasizing its potential utility in the clinical practice.

<p class="mathjax">Due to their intrinsic capabilities on parallel signal processing, optical
neural networks (ONNs) have attracted extensive interests recently as a
potential alternative to electronic artificial neural networks (ANNs) with
reduced power consumption and low latency. Preliminary confirmation of the
parallelism in optical computing has been widely done by applying the
technology of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in the linear
transformation part of neural networks. However, inter-channel crosstalk has
obstructed WDM technologies to be deployed in nonlinear activation in ONNs.
Here, we propose a universal WDM structure called multiplexed neuron sets (MNS)
which apply WDM technologies to optical neurons and enable ONNs to be further
compressed. A corresponding back-propagation (BP) training algorithm is
proposed to alleviate or even cancel the influence of inter-channel crosstalk
on MNS-based WDM-ONNs. For simplicity, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs)
are employed as an example of MNS to construct a WDM-ONN trained with the new
algorithm. The result shows that the combination of MNS and the corresponding
BP training algorithm significantly downsize the system and improve the energy
efficiency to tens of times while giving similar performance to traditional
ONNs.

<p class="mathjax">Acquiring reliable microstructure datasets is a pivotal step toward the
systematic design of materials with the aid of integrated computational
materials engineering (ICME) approaches. However, obtaining three-dimensional
(3D) microstructure datasets is often challenging due to high experimental
costs or technical limitations, while acquiring two-dimensional (2D)
micrographs is comparatively easier. To deal with this issue, this study
proposes a novel framework for 2D-to-3D reconstruction of microstructures
called Micro3Diff using diffusion-based generative models (DGMs). Specifically,
this approach solely requires pre-trained DGMs for the generation of 2D
samples, and dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) takes place only during the
generation process (i.e., reverse diffusion process). The proposed framework
incorporates a new concept referred to as multi-plane denoising diffusion,
which transforms noisy samples (i.e., latent variables) from different planes
into the data structure while maintaining spatial connectivity in 3D space.
Furthermore, a harmonized sampling process is developed to address possible
deviations from the reverse Markov chain of DGMs during the dimensionality
expansion. Combined, we demonstrate the feasibility of Micro3Diff in
reconstructing 3D samples with connected slices that maintain morphologically
equivalence to the original 2D images. To validate the performance of
Micro3Diff, various types of microstructures (synthetic and experimentally
observed) are reconstructed, and the quality of the generated samples is
assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The successful reconstruction
outcomes inspire the potential utilization of Micro3Diff in upcoming ICME
applications while achieving a breakthrough in comprehending and manipulating
the latent space of DGMs.

<p class="mathjax">Generative models have emerged as a promising technique for producing
high-quality images that are indistinguishable from real images. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) are two of the
most prominent and widely studied generative models. GANs have demonstrated
excellent performance in generating sharp realistic images and VAEs have shown
strong abilities to generate diverse images. However, GANs suffer from ignoring
a large portion of the possible output space which does not represent the full
diversity of the target distribution, and VAEs tend to produce blurry images.
To fully capitalize on the strengths of both models while mitigating their
weaknesses, we employ a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) approach to merge GANs
and VAEs. Our procedure incorporates both Wasserstein and maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) measures in the loss function to enable effective learning of
the latent space and generate diverse and high-quality samples. By fusing the
discriminative power of GANs with the reconstruction capabilities of VAEs, our
novel model achieves superior performance in various generative tasks, such as
anomaly detection and data augmentation. Furthermore, we enhance the model's
capability by employing an extra generator in the code space, which enables us
to explore areas of the code space that the VAE might have overlooked. With a
BNP perspective, we can model the data distribution using an
infinite-dimensional space, which provides greater flexibility in the model and
reduces the risk of overfitting. By utilizing this framework, we can enhance
the performance of both GANs and VAEs to create a more robust generative model
suitable for various applications.

and fairness in voice biometric systems, guided by the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) mandates, which underscore the need for minimizing the
processing and storage of private and sensitive data, and ensuring fairness in
automated decision-making systems. We adopt an approach that involves the
fine-tuning of the wav2vec 2.0 model for speaker verification tasks, evaluating
potential gender-related privacy vulnerabilities in the process. Gender
influences during the fine-tuning process were employed to enhance fairness and
privacy in order to emphasise or obscure gender information within the

model increases privacy against uninformed attacks, yet slightly diminishes
speaker verification performance compared to the non-adversarial model.
However, the model's efficacy reduces against informed attacks. Analysis of
system performance was conducted to identify potential gender biases, thus
highlighting the need for further research to understand and improve the
delicate interplay between utility, privacy, and equity in voice biometric

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a bi-modality medical image synthesis approach
based on sequential generative adversarial network (GAN) and semi-supervised
learning. Our approach consists of two generative modules that synthesize
images of the two modalities in a sequential order. A method for measuring the
synthesis complexity is proposed to automatically determine the synthesis order
in our sequential GAN. Images of the modality with a lower complexity are
synthesized first, and the counterparts with a higher complexity are generated
later. Our sequential GAN is trained end-to-end in a semi-supervised manner. In
supervised training, the joint distribution of bi-modality images are learned
from real paired images of the two modalities by explicitly minimizing the
reconstruction losses between the real and synthetic images. To avoid
overfitting limited training images, in unsupervised training, the marginal
distribution of each modality is learned based on unpaired images by minimizing
the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of real and fake images. We
comprehensively evaluate the proposed model using two synthesis tasks based on
three types of evaluate metrics and user studies. Visual and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art
methods, and reasonable visual quality and clinical significance. Code is made

<p class="mathjax">The Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) method is an important
extrapolation-based numerical algorithm that accelerates the convergence of the
gradient descent method in convex optimization. When dealing with an objective
function that is $\mu$-strongly convex, selecting extrapolation coefficients
dependent on $\mu$ enables global R-linear convergence. In cases $\mu$ is
unknown, a commonly adopted approach is to set the extrapolation coefficient
using the original NAG method, referred to as NAG-c. This choice allows for
achieving the optimal iteration complexity among first-order methods for
general convex problems. However, it remains an open question whether the NAG-c
method exhibits global R-linear convergence for strongly convex problems. In
this work, we answer this question positively by establishing the Q-linear
convergence of certain constructed Lyapunov sequences. Furthermore, we extend
our result to the global R-linear convergence of the accelerated proximal
gradient method, which is employed for solving strongly convex composite
optimization problems with nonsmooth terms in the objective function.
Interestingly, these results contradict the findings of the continuous
counterpart of the NAG-c method in [Su, Boyd, and Cand\'es, J. Mach. Learn.
Res., 2016, 17(153), 1-43], where the convergence rate by the suggested
ordinary differential equation cannot exceed $O(1/{\tt poly}(k))$ for strongly
convex functions.

<p class="mathjax">Utilizing deep learning (DL) models to improve the early diagnosis of nasal
diseases from nasal endoscopic images holds paramount importance. However, the
lack of available datasets stymies advancements in this field. Furthermore,
existing models fail to strike a good trade-off between model diagnosis
performance, model complexity and parameter size, rendering them unsuitable for
practical application. To bridge these gaps, we created the first large-scale
nasal endoscopy dataset, named 7-NasEID, comprising 11,352 images that span six
nasal diseases and normal samples. Building on this, we proposed U-SEANNet, an
innovative architecture, underpinned by depth-wise separable convolutions.
Additionally, to augment its discernment capabilities for subtle variations in
input images, we further proposed the Global-Local Channel Feature Fusion
Module, enabling the U-SEANNet to focus salient channel features from both
global and local contexts. Notably, U-SEANNet's parameter size and GFLOPs are
only 0.78M and 0.21, respectively. Employing the 7-NasalEID, we conducted the
five-fold cross-validation on U-SEANNet, juxtaposing its performance against
seventeen renowned architectures. The experimental results suggest U-SEANNet as
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, achieves an accuracy of 93.58%, sensitivity
of 90.17%, and specificity of 91.27%. These findings demonstrate U-SEANNet's
prodigious potential for diagnosing nasal diseases in practical use, providing
the development of efficacy nasal diseases diagnosis tools with a new insight.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years witnessed the development of powerful generative models based on
flows, diffusion or autoregressive neural networks, achieving remarkable
success in generating data from examples with applications in a broad range of
areas. A theoretical analysis of the performance and understanding of the
limitations of these methods remain, however, challenging. In this paper, we
undertake a step in this direction by analysing the efficiency of sampling by
these methods on a class of problems with a known probability distribution and
comparing it with the sampling performance of more traditional methods such as
the Monte Carlo Markov chain and Langevin dynamics. We focus on a class of
probability distribution widely studied in the statistical physics of
disordered systems that relate to spin glasses, statistical inference and
constraint satisfaction problems.
<br />We leverage the fact that sampling via flow-based, diffusion-based or
autoregressive networks methods can be equivalently mapped to the analysis of a
Bayes optimal denoising of a modified probability measure. Our findings
demonstrate that these methods encounter difficulties in sampling stemming from
the presence of a first-order phase transition along the algorithm's denoising
path. Our conclusions go both ways: we identify regions of parameters where
these methods are unable to sample efficiently, while that is possible using
standard Monte Carlo or Langevin approaches. We also identify regions where the
opposite happens: standard approaches are inefficient while the discussed
generative methods work well.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse variational approximations are popular methods for scaling up
inference and learning in Gaussian processes to larger datasets. For $N$
training points, exact inference has $O(N^3)$ cost; with $M \ll N$ features,
state of the art sparse variational methods have $O(NM^2)$ cost. Recently,
methods have been proposed using more sophisticated features; these promise
$O(M^3)$ cost, with good performance in low dimensional tasks such as spatial
modelling, but they only work with a very limited class of kernels, excluding
some of the most commonly used. In this work, we propose integrated Fourier
features, which extends these performance benefits to a very broad class of
stationary covariance functions. We motivate the method and choice of
parameters from a convergence analysis and empirical exploration, and show
practical speedup in synthetic and real world spatial regression tasks.

<p class="mathjax">The ensemble Gaussian mixture filter (EnGMF) is a powerful filter for highly
non-Gaussian and non-linear models that has practical utility in the case of a
small number of samples, and theoretical convergence to full Bayesian inference
in the ensemble limit. We aim to increase the utility of the EnGMF by
introducing an ensemble-local notion of covariance into the kernel density
estimation (KDE) step for the prior distribution. We prove that in the Gaussian
case, our new ensemble-localized KDE technique is exactly the same as more
traditional KDE techniques. We also show an example of a non-Gaussian
distribution that can fail to be approximated by canonical KDE methods, but can
be approximated exactly by our new KDE technique. We showcase our new KDE
technique on a simple bivariate problem, showing that it has nice qualitative
and quantitative properties, and significantly improves the estimate of the
prior and posterior distributions for all ensemble sizes tested. We
additionally show the utility of the proposed methodology for sequential
filtering for the Lorenz '63 equations, achieving a significant reduction in
error, and less conservative behavior in the uncertainty estimate with respect
to traditional techniques.

<p class="mathjax">NP-complete problems are widely and deeply involved in various real-life
scenarios while still intractable to solve efficiently on conventional
computers. It is of great practical significance to construct versatile
computing architectures that solve NP-complete problems with computational
advantage. Here, we present a reconfigurable photonic processor to efficiently
solve a benchmark NP-complete problem, the subset sum problem (SSP). We show
that in the case of successive primes, the photonic processor has genuinely
surpassed commercial electronic processors launched recently by taking
advantages of the high propagation speed and vast parallelism of photons and
state-of-the-art integrated photonic technology. Moreover, we are able to
program the photonic processor to tackle different problem instances relying on
the tunable integrated modules, variable split junctions, which can be used to
build a fully reconfigurable architecture potentially allowing $2^{N}$
configurations at most. Our experiments confirm the potential of the photonic
processor as a versatile and efficient computing platform, suggesting a
possible practical route to solving computationally hard problems at large
scale.

<p class="mathjax">Gearbox fault diagnosis is one of the most important parts in any industrial
systems. Failure of components inside gearbox can lead to a catastrophic
failure, uneven breakdown, and financial losses in industrial organization. In
that case intelligent maintenance of the gearbox comes into context. This paper
presents an integrated gearbox fault diagnosis approach which can easily deploy
in online condition monitoring. This work introduces a nonparametric data
preprocessing technique i.e., calculus enhanced energy operator (CEEO) to
preserve the characteristics frequencies in the noisy and inferred vibrational
signal. A set of time domain and spectral domain features are calculated from
the raw and CEEO vibration signal and inputted to the multiclass support vector
machine (MCSVM) to diagnose the faults on the system. An effective comparison
between raw signal and CEEO signal are presented to show the impact of CEEO in
gearbox fault diagnosis. The obtained results of this work look very promising
and can be implemented in any type of industrial system due to its
nonparametric nature.

<p class="mathjax">For linear systems, many data-driven control methods rely on the behavioral
framework, using historical data of the system to predict the future
trajectories. However, measurement noise introduces errors in predictions. When
the noise is bounded, we propose a method for designing historical experiments
that enable the computation of an upper bound on the prediction error. This
approach allows us to formulate a minimax control problem where robust
constraint satisfaction is enforced. We derive an upper bound on the
suboptimality gap of the resulting control input sequence compared to optimal
control utilizing accurate measurements. As demonstrated in numerical
experiments, the solution derived by our method can achieve constraint
satisfaction and a small suboptimality gap despite the measurement noise.

<p class="mathjax">Higher-order networks are gaining growing attention as they encode for the
many-body interactions present in complex systems. However, higher-order
networks have the limitation that they only capture many-body interactions of
the same type. To tackle this challenge, here we provide a mathematical
framework to capture the topology of higher-order multiplex networks and the
interplay between their topology and higher-order dynamics. In particular we
focus on diffusion of topological signals sustained not only by the nodes, but
also by the links, and the higher-dimensional simplices of multiplex simplicial
complexes. We exploit the ubiquitous presence of the overlap of the simplices
for coupling the dynamics among the multiplex layers providing a definition of
multiplex Hodge Laplacians and Dirac operators. The spectral properties of
these operators are shown to determine the higher-order diffusion on the
higher-order multiplex networks, and encode for the multiplex Betti numbers.
Finally, our numerical investigation of the spectral properties of synthetic
and real (connectome and microbiome) multiplex simplicial complexes shows
evidence that the coupling between the layers can either speed up or slow down
the higher-order diffusion of topological signals. This mathematical framework
is very general and can be applied to study generic higher-order systems with
interactions of multiple types. In particular, these results might find
applications in brain networks which are understood to be both multilayer and
higher-order.

<p class="mathjax">Score-based generative models have demonstrated highly promising results for
medical image reconstruction tasks in magnetic resonance imaging or computed
tomography. However, their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is
still largely unexplored. PET image reconstruction involves a variety of
challenges, including Poisson noise with high variance and a wide dynamic
range. To address these challenges, we propose several PET-specific adaptations
of score-based generative models. The proposed framework is developed for both
2D and 3D PET. In addition, we provide an extension to guided reconstruction
using magnetic resonance images. We validate the approach through extensive 2D
and 3D $\textit{in-silico}$ experiments with a model trained on
patient-realistic data without lesions, and evaluate on data without lesions as
well as out-of-distribution data with lesions. This demonstrates the proposed
method's robustness and significant potential for improved PET reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">We present Predictive Sparse Manifold Transform (PSMT), a minimalistic,
interpretable and biologically plausible framework for learning and predicting
natural dynamics. PSMT incorporates two layers where the first sparse coding
layer represents the input sequence as sparse coefficients over an overcomplete
dictionary and the second manifold learning layer learns a geometric embedding
space that captures topological similarity and dynamic temporal linearity in
sparse coefficients. We apply PSMT on a natural video dataset and evaluate the
reconstruction performance with respect to contextual variability, the number
of sparse coding basis functions and training samples. We then interpret the
dynamic topological organization in the embedding space. We next utilize PSMT
to predict future frames compared with two baseline methods with a static
embedding space. We demonstrate that PSMT with a dynamic embedding space can
achieve better prediction performance compared to static baselines. Our work
establishes that PSMT is an efficient unsupervised generative framework for
prediction of future visual stimuli.

<p class="mathjax">Despite recent medical advancements, breast cancer remains one of the most
prevalent and deadly diseases among women. Although machine learning-based
Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown potential to assist
radiologists in analyzing medical images, the opaque nature of the
best-performing CAD systems has raised concerns about their trustworthiness and
interpretability. This paper proposes MT-BI-RADS, a novel explainable deep
learning approach for tumor detection in Breast Ultrasound (BUS) images. The
approach offers three levels of explanations to enable radiologists to
comprehend the decision-making process in predicting tumor malignancy. Firstly,
the proposed model outputs the BI-RADS categories used for BUS image analysis
by radiologists. Secondly, the model employs multi-task learning to
concurrently segment regions in images that correspond to tumors. Thirdly, the
proposed approach outputs quantified contributions of each BI-RADS descriptor
toward predicting the benign or malignant class using post-hoc explanations
with Shapley Values.

<p class="mathjax">Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) is a modern class of model-free
machine learning that enables an accurate forecasting of time series data
generated by dynamical systems. We demonstrate that NG-RC can accurately
predict full many-body quantum dynamics, instead of merely concentrating on the
dynamics of observables, which is the conventional application of reservoir
computing. In addition, we apply a technique which we refer to as skipping
ahead to predict far future states accurately without the need to extract
information about the intermediate states. However, adopting a classical NG-RC
for many-body quantum dynamics prediction is computationally prohibitive due to
the large Hilbert space of sample input data. In this work, we propose an
end-to-end quantum algorithm for many-body quantum dynamics forecasting with a
quantum computational speedup via the block-encoding technique. This proposal
presents an efficient model-free quantum scheme to forecast quantum dynamics
coherently, bypassing inductive biases incurred in a model-based approach.

discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to stochastic uncertainties. We derive
some useful results on the worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and
define a discrete-time risk-aware control barrier function using the worst-case
CVaR. On this basis, we present optimization-based control approaches that
integrate the worst-case CVaR into the control barrier function, taking into
account both safe set and tail risk considerations. In particular, three types
of safe sets are discussed in detail: half-space, polytope, and ellipsoid. It
is shown that control inputs for the half-space and polytopic safe sets can be
obtained via quadratic programs, while control inputs for the ellipsoidal safe
set can be computed via a semidefinite program. Through numerical examples of
an inverted pendulum, we compare its performance with existing methods and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed controller.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we address the so-called general Fokker-Planck control problem
for discrete-time first-order linear systems. Unlike conventional treatments,
we don't assume the distributions of the system states to be Gaussian. Instead,
we only assume the existence and finiteness of the first several order power
moments of the distributions. It is proved in the literature that there doesn't
exist a solution, which has a form of conventional feedback control, to this
problem. We propose a moment representation of the system to turn the original
problem into a finite-dimensional one. Then a novel feedback control term,
which is a mixture of a feedback term and a Markovian transition kernel term is
proposed to serve as the control input of the moment system. The states of the
moment system are obtained by maximizing the smoothness of the state
transition. The power moments of the transition kernels are obtained by a
convex optimization problem, of which the solution is proved to exist and be
unique. Then they are mapped back to the probability distributions. The control
inputs to the original system are then obtained by sampling from the realized
distributions. Simulation results are provided to validate our algorithm in
treating the general discrete-time Fokker-Planck control problem.

<p class="mathjax">To support the extremely high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency
requirements, and emerging applications of future wireless communications,
holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) technology is envisioned as
one of the most promising enablers. It can potentially bring extra
degrees-of-freedom for communications and signal processing, including spatial
multiplexing in line-of-sight (LoS) channels and electromagnetic (EM) field
processing performed using specialized devices, to attain the fundamental
limits of wireless communications. In this context, EM-domain channel modeling
is critical to harvest the benefits offered by H-MIMO. Existing EM-domain
channel models are built based on the tensor Green function, which require
prior knowledge of the global position and/or the relative distances and
directions of the transmit/receive antenna elements. Such knowledge may be
difficult to acquire in real-world applications due to extensive measurements
needed for obtaining this data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
transmit-receive parameter separable channel model methodology in which the
EM-domain (or holographic) channel can be simply acquired from the
distance/direction measured between the center-points between the transmit and
receive surfaces, and the local positions between the transmit and receive
elements, thus avoiding extensive global parameter measurements. Analysis and
numerical results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed channel modeling
approach in approximating the H-MIMO channel, and achieving the theoretical
channel capacity.

<p class="mathjax">Lesion volume is an important predictor for prognosis in breast cancer. We
make a step towards a more accurate lesion volume measurement on digital
mammograms by developing a model that allows to estimate lesion volumes on
processed mammograms, which are the images routinely used by radiologists in
clinical practice as well as in breast cancer screening and are available in
medical centers. Processed mammograms are obtained from raw mammograms, which
are the X-ray data coming directly from the scanner, by applying certain
vendor-specific non-linear transformations. At the core of our volume
estimation method is a physics-based algorithm for measuring lesion volumes on
raw mammograms. We subsequently extend this algorithm to processed mammograms
via a deep learning image-to-image translation model that produces synthetic
raw mammograms from processed mammograms in a multi-vendor setting. We assess
the reliability and validity of our method using a dataset of 1778 mammograms
with an annotated mass. Firstly, we investigate the correlations between lesion
volumes computed from mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views, with a
resulting Pearson correlation of 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 -
0.93]. Secondly, we compare the resulting lesion volumes from true and
synthetic raw data, with a resulting Pearson correlation of 0.998 [95% CI 0.998
- 0.998] . Finally, for a subset of 100 mammograms with a malign mass and
concurrent MRI examination available, we analyze the agreement between lesion
volume on mammography and MRI, resulting in an intraclass correlation
coefficient of 0.81 [95% CI 0.73 - 0.87] for consistency and 0.78 [95% CI 0.66
- 0.86] for absolute agreement. In conclusion, we developed an algorithm to
measure mammographic lesion volume that reached excellent reliability and good
validity, when using MRI as ground truth.

mainly focused on the SSVD(sparse SVD) method and tried a new sparse penalty
named "Prenet penalty" which has been used only in factor analysis to gain
sparsity. Then in the simulation study, we tried different types of generated
datasets (with different sparsity and dimension) and tried 1-layer

effective for non-overlapped data. Finally, we used some real gene expression

<p class="mathjax">Recently, there has been a growing interest in the field of controllable
Text-to-Speech (TTS). While previous studies have relied on users providing
specific style factor values based on acoustic knowledge or selecting reference
speeches that meet certain requirements, generating speech solely from natural
text prompts has emerged as a new challenge for researchers. This challenge
arises due to the scarcity of high-quality speech datasets with natural text
style prompt and the absence of advanced text-controllable TTS models. In light
of this, 1) we propose TextrolSpeech, which is the first large-scale speech
emotion dataset annotated with rich text attributes. The dataset comprises
236,220 pairs of style prompt in natural text descriptions with five style
factors and corresponding speech samples. Through iterative experimentation, we
introduce a multi-stage prompt programming approach that effectively utilizes
the GPT model for generating natural style descriptions in large volumes. 2)
Furthermore, to address the need for generating audio with greater style
diversity, we propose an efficient architecture called Salle. This architecture
treats text controllable TTS as a language model task, utilizing audio codec
codes as an intermediate representation to replace the conventional
mel-spectrogram. Finally, we successfully demonstrate the ability of the
proposed model by showing a comparable performance in the controllable TTS
task. Audio samples are available at https://sall-e.github.io/

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) leverages large datasets of unlabeled speech
to reach impressive performance with reduced amounts of annotated data. The
high number of proposed approaches fostered the emergence of comprehensive
benchmarks that evaluate their performance on a set of downstream tasks
exploring various aspects of the speech signal. However, while the number of
considered tasks has been growing, most proposals rely upon a single downstream
architecture that maps the frozen SSL representations to the task labels. This
study examines how benchmarking results are affected by changes in the probing
head architecture. Interestingly, we found that altering the downstream
architecture structure leads to significant fluctuations in the performance
ranking of the evaluated models. Against common practices in speech SSL
benchmarking, we evaluate larger-capacity probing heads, showing their impact
on performance, inference costs, generalization and multi-level feature
exploitation.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread adoption of machine learning and other matrix intensive
computing algorithms has inspired renewed interest in analog optical computing,
which has the potential to perform large-scale matrix multiplications with
superior energy scaling and lower latency than digital electronics. However,
most existing optical techniques rely on spatial multiplexing to encode and
process data in parallel, requiring a large number of high-speed modulators and
detectors. More importantly, most of these architectures are restricted to
performing a single kernel convolution operation per layer. Here, we introduce
a fiber-optic computing architecture based on temporal multiplexing and
distributed feedback that performs multiple convolutions on the input data in a
single layer (i.e. grouped convolutions). Our approach relies on temporally
encoding the input data as an optical pulse train and injecting it into an
optical fiber where partial reflectors create a series of delayed copies of the
input vector. In this work, we used Rayleigh backscattering in standard single
mode fiber as the partial reflectors to encode a series of random kernel
transforms. We show that this technique effectively performs a random
non-linear projection of the input data into a higher dimensional space which
can facilitate a variety of computing tasks, including non-linear principal
component analysis, support vector machines, or extreme learning machines. By
using a passive fiber to perform the kernel transforms, this approach enables
efficient energy scaling with orders of magnitude lower power consumption than
GPUs, while using a high-speed modulator and detector maintains low latency and
high data-throughput. Finally, our approach is readily integrated with
fiber-optic communication links, enabling additional applications such as
processing remote sensing data transmitted in the analog domain.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of parameter estimation from observations given by a
generalized linear model. Spectral methods are a simple yet effective approach
for estimation: they estimate the parameter via the principal eigenvector of a
matrix obtained by suitably preprocessing the observations. Despite their wide
use, a rigorous performance characterization of spectral estimators, as well as
a principled way to preprocess the data, is available only for unstructured
(i.e., i.i.d. Gaussian and Haar) designs. In contrast, real-world design
matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address
this problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs which capture the
anisotropic nature of the measurements via a feature covariance matrix
$\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the
performance of spectral estimators in this setting. This then allows to
identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed
to meaningfully estimate the parameter. Remarkably, such an optimal spectral
estimator depends on $\Sigma$ only through its normalized trace, which can be
consistently estimated from the data. Numerical results demonstrate the
advantage of our principled approach over previous heuristic methods.
<br />Existing analyses of spectral estimators crucially rely on the rotational
invariance of the design matrix. This key assumption does not hold for
correlated Gaussian designs. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop a novel
strategy based on designing and analyzing an approximate message passing
algorithm whose fixed point coincides with the desired spectral estimator. Our
methodology is general, and opens the way to the precise characterization of
spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Benefiting from the development of deep learning, text-to-speech (TTS)
techniques using clean speech have achieved significant performance
improvements. The data collected from real scenes often contain noise and
generally needs to be denoised by speech enhancement models. Noise-robust TTS
models are often trained using the enhanced speech, which thus suffer from
speech distortion and background noise that affect the quality of the
synthesized speech. Meanwhile, it was shown that self-supervised pre-trained
models exhibit excellent noise robustness on many speech tasks, implying that
the learned representation has a better tolerance for noise perturbations. In
this work, we therefore explore pre-trained models to improve the noise
robustness of TTS models. Based on HIFI-GAN we first propose a
representation-to-waveform vocoder, which aims to learn to map the
representation of pre-trained models to the waveform. We then propose a
text-to-representation Fastspeech2 model, which aims to learn to map text to
pre-trained model representations. Experimental results on the LJSpeech and
LibriTTS datasets show that our method outperforms those using speech
enhancement methods in both subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples are

<p class="mathjax">In radio astronomy, visibility data, which are measurements of wave signals
from radio telescopes, are transformed into images for observation of distant
celestial objects. However, these resultant images usually contain both real
sources and artifacts, due to signal sparsity and other factors. One way to
obtain cleaner images is to reconstruct samples into dense forms before
imaging. Unfortunately, existing visibility reconstruction methods may miss
some components of the frequency data, so blurred object edges and persistent
artifacts remain in the images. Furthermore, the computation overhead is high
on irregular visibility samples due to the data skew. To address these
problems, we propose PolarRec, a reconstruction method for interferometric
visibility data, which consists of a transformer-conditioned neural fields
pipeline with a polar coordinate representation. This representation matches
the way in which telescopes observe a celestial area as the Earth rotates. We
further propose Radial Frequency Loss function, using radial coordinates in the
polar coordinate system to correlate with the frequency information, to help
reconstruct complete visibility. We also group visibility sample points by
angular coordinates in the polar coordinate system, and use groups as the
granularity for subsequent encoding with a Transformer encoder. Consequently,
our method can capture the inherent characteristics of visibility data
effectively and efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate that PolarRec markedly
improves imaging results by faithfully reconstructing all frequency components
in the visibility domain while significantly reducing the computation cost.

<p class="mathjax">Knowing the room geometry may be very beneficial for many audio applications,
including sound reproduction, acoustic scene analysis, and sound source
localization. Room geometry inference (RGI) deals with the problem of reflector
localization (RL) based on a set of room impulse responses (RIRs). Motivated by
the increasing popularity of commercially available soundbars, this article
presents a data-driven 3D RGI method using RIRs measured from a linear
loudspeaker array to a single microphone. A convolutional recurrent neural
network (CRNN) is trained using simulated RIRs in a supervised fashion for RL.
The Radon transform, which is equivalent to delay-and-sum beamforming, is
applied to multi-channel RIRs, and the resulting time-domain acoustic
beamforming map is fed into the CRNN. The room geometry is inferred from the
microphone position and the reflector locations estimated by the network. The
results obtained using measured RIRs show that the proposed data-driven
approach generalizes well to unseen RIRs and achieves an accuracy level
comparable to a baseline model-driven RGI method that involves intermediate
semi-supervised steps, thereby offering a unified and fully automated RGI
framework.

<p class="mathjax">Angiography is widely used to detect, diagnose, and treat cerebrovascular
diseases. While numerous techniques have been proposed to segment the vascular
network from different imaging modalities, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, existing DL methods often depend on proprietary
datasets and extensive manual annotation. Moreover, the availability of
pre-trained networks specifically for medical domains and 3D volumes is
limited. To overcome these challenges, we propose a few-shot learning approach
called VesselShot for cerebrovascular segmentation. VesselShot leverages
knowledge from a few annotated support images and mitigates the scarcity of
labeled data and the need for extensive annotation in cerebral blood vessel
segmentation. We evaluated the performance of VesselShot using the publicly
available TubeTK dataset for the segmentation task, achieving a mean Dice
coefficient (DC) of 0.62(0.03).

<p class="mathjax">This technical report details our submission system to the CHiME-7 DASR
Challenge, which focuses on speaker diarization and speech recognition under
complex multi-speaker settings. Additionally, it also evaluates the efficiency
of systems in handling diverse array devices. To address these issues, we
implemented an end-to-end speaker diarization system and introduced a
rectification strategy based on multi-channel spatial information. This
approach significantly diminished the word error rates (WER). In terms of
recognition, we utilized publicly available pre-trained models as the
foundational models to train our end-to-end speech recognition models. Our
system attained a macro-averaged diarization-attributed WER (DA-WER) of 22.4\%
on the CHiME-7 development set, which signifies a relative improvement of
52.5\% over the official baseline system.

<p class="mathjax">Crater mapping using neural networks and other automated methods has
increased recently with automated Crater Detection Algorithms (CDAs) applied to
planetary bodies throughout the solar system. A recent publication by Benedix
et al. (2020) showed high performance at small scales compared to similar
automated CDAs but with a net positive diameter bias in many crater candidates.
I compare the publicly available catalogs from Benedix et al. (2020) and Lee &amp;
Hogan (2021) and show that the reported performance is sensitive to the metrics
used to test the catalogs. I show how the more permissive comparison methods
indicate a higher CDA performance by allowing worse candidate craters to match
ground-truth craters. I show that the Benedix et al. (2020) catalog has a
substantial performance loss with increasing latitude and identify an image
projection issue that might cause this loss. Finally, I suggest future
applications of neural networks in generating large scientific datasets be
validated using secondary networks with independent data sources or training
methods.

solutions to overcome limitations in the current allocation mechanism. We
introduce a natural preference domain and a priority structure that address
these setbacks, aiming to enhance the allocation process. To achieve this, we
present an adaptation of the Deferred Acceptance mechanism to our problem,
which ensures strategy-proofness within our preference domain and yields the

<p class="mathjax">Vehicular communication networks are rapidly emerging as vehicles become
smarter. However, these networks are increasingly susceptible to various
attacks. The situation is exacerbated by the rise in automated vehicles
complicates, emphasizing the need for security and authentication measures to
ensure safe and effective traffic management. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid physical layer security (PLS)-machine learning (ML) authentication
scheme by exploiting the position of the transmitter vehicle as a device
fingerprint. We use a time-of-arrival (ToA) based localization mechanism where
the ToA is estimated at roadside units (RSUs), and the coordinates of the
transmitter vehicle are extracted at the base station (BS).Furthermore, to
track the mobility of the moving legitimate vehicle, we use ML model trained on
several system parameters. We try two ML models for this purpose, i.e., support
vector regression and decision tree. To evaluate our scheme, we conduct binary
hypothesis testing on the estimated positions with the help of the ground
truths provided by the ML model, which classifies the transmitter node as
legitimate or malicious. Moreover, we consider the probability of false alarm
and the probability of missed detection as performance metrics resulting from
the binary hypothesis testing, and mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error
(MSE), and coefficient of determination $\text{R}^2$ to further evaluate the ML
models. We also compare our scheme with a baseline scheme that exploits the
angle of arrival at RSUs for authentication. We observe that our proposed
position-based mechanism outperforms the baseline scheme significantly in terms
of missed detections.

<p class="mathjax">Ensembling a neural network is a widely recognized approach to enhance model
performance, estimate uncertainty, and improve robustness in deep supervised
learning. However, deep ensembles often come with high computational costs and
memory demands. In addition, the efficiency of a deep ensemble is related to
diversity among the ensemble members which is challenging for large,
over-parameterized deep neural networks. Moreover, ensemble learning has not
yet seen such widespread adoption, and it remains a challenging endeavor for
self-supervised or unsupervised representation learning. Motivated by these
challenges, we present a novel self-supervised training regime that leverages
an ensemble of independent sub-networks, complemented by a new loss function
designed to encourage diversity. Our method efficiently builds a sub-model
ensemble with high diversity, leading to well-calibrated estimates of model
uncertainty, all achieved with minimal computational overhead compared to
traditional deep self-supervised ensembles. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks,
including in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection,
dataset corruption, and semi-supervised settings. The results demonstrate that
our method significantly improves prediction reliability. Our approach not only
achieves excellent accuracy but also enhances calibration, surpassing baseline
performance across a wide range of self-supervised architectures in computer
vision, natural language processing, and genomics data.

provide interesting computational problems and modelling tools useful in a

which this theory is clearly central, providing the relevant definitions to
make the material accessible to both cryptographers and group theorists, in the
hope of stimulating further interaction between these two (non-disjoint)

<p class="mathjax">We study the composite convex optimization problems with a
Quasi-Self-Concordant smooth component. This problem class naturally
interpolates between classic Self-Concordant functions and functions with
Lipschitz continuous Hessian. Previously, the best complexity bounds for this
problem class were associated with trust-region schemes and implementations of
a ball-minimization oracle. In this paper, we show that for minimizing
Quasi-Self-Concordant functions we can use instead the basic Newton Method with
Gradient Regularization. For unconstrained minimization, it only involves a
simple matrix inversion operation (solving a linear system) at each step. We
prove a fast global linear rate for this algorithm, matching the complexity
bound of the trust-region scheme, while our method remains especially simple to
implement. Then, we introduce the Dual Newton Method, and based on it, develop
the corresponding Accelerated Newton Scheme for this problem class, which
further improves the complexity factor of the basic method. As a direct
consequence of our results, we establish fast global linear rates of simple
variants of the Newton Method applied to several practical problems, including
Logistic Regression, Soft Maximum, and Matrix Scaling, without requiring
additional assumptions on strong or uniform convexity for the target objective.

<p class="mathjax">Variational quantum algorithms exploit the features of superposition and
entanglement to optimize a cost function efficiently by manipulating the
quantum states. They are suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
computers that recently became accessible to the worldwide research community.
Here, we implement and demonstrate the numerical processes on the 5-qubit and
7-qubit quantum processors on the IBM Qiskit Runtime platform. We combine the
commercial finite-element-method (FEM) software ABAQUS with the implementation
of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to establish an integrated pipeline.
Three examples are used to investigate the performance: a hexagonal truss, a
Timoshenko beam, and a plane-strain continuum. We conduct parametric studies on
the convergence of fundamental natural frequency estimation using this hybrid
quantum-classical approach. Our findings can be extended to problems with many
more degrees of freedom when quantum computers with hundreds of qubits become
available in the near future.
